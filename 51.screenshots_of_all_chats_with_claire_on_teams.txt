Claire Thomson 06/06 16:19

If we created a module we'd have a single variable file and pass the values into that, but yes definitely
not needed at the moment - purely just defined in the tf files for each VPC

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an
idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So i am breaking them down,
each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the

same.
To be honest trying to get users to provide an SSH key at all is often difficult @

Good morning Claire.

Unfortunately , i got news that my uncle passed away in the early hours of this day despite all the best
efforts of the hospital staffTo be frank, i knew deep inside that only a miracle could reverse the
inevitable because the odds were most upsetting from the beginning.

So i would like to please take today off in order to start dealing with all the consequences brought
forward by the event and i have just sent through the timetastic app a request for the day; | will also
need to go pick up at the airport some family members who will be leaving Paris this very morning.

So therefore from now on, our sftp users will not have to do anything really..
All they will have to care about is ... choosing a username....and the rest is done for them.
Best yet the process can be repeated for an unlimited number of users.

On the test performed on a server with one core and 2 GB of ram, the server was able to generate the
keys and set up all aspects of the server at the rate of 5 users per second.

| will push the updated code tomorrow

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday... was running
the risk of forgetting tomorrow (the ailment of old age as | come to experience it) and | wanted to
devote tomorrow to a more agile and elastic way of dynamically generate terraform steps for AWS.

Many thanks

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144.217.84.102

-username: arnold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

lam also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Good morning Claire.With the unavaibility of the arnoldclarkemployee site, | thought | would remind
you that | was meant to be have a day off today.
Claire Thomson 30/12/22 08:53

Yes that's fine take your day off there's very little you can do anyway

Did you manage to get any servers scanned yesterday? Didn't get a chance for catch up

30/12/22 09:44

Actually before my message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before running it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

So here is my question:

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance
you would be interested into an investigation about an alternative which is about combining Nexus
(Artifact repository) and SonarQube (code vulnerability scanner that is applicable to Docker)

Of course both Sonarqube and Nexus are Open source but used by banks...the banks i was supported
not so long ago were using it.

re Thomson 20/12/22 15:29

No we've just renewed our contract with Palo Alto, we can use it for scanning on prem stuff too - there's

lots of bits we don't use
it scans our repository too

20/12/22 15:30

aaaah it is too late@®

Claire Thomson 20/12/22 15:30

it can do code scanning and stuff and is in the pipelines

many thanks in advance

¢ that's them approved, you just need to pop them through in ACE now - and set me as the approver and
ot approve there (or katie bell from admin as I've approved in timetastic she can do it in ACE) it'sa

pain having two systems, hopefully one day all the functionality will just be in ace

vs you'd had the 26th booked automatically on timetastic by admin as the company is closed

MM cart that in ACE

aaah ok i do it right away

19/12/22 16:29

| just booked the days in ACE.
But on ACE i see three days of holidays instead of 2 on timetastic

which one will be considered the system of truth ?

Good morning Claire.

| hope my message finds you well.

So, i was fortunate enough to review some of the awaiting tickets we have with Greg a couple of days
ago and i noticed a couple of them that are dealing with some security issues with a sftp server used

by one of our partners.

So i was wondering if i could may be take a few minutes of your time either today or tomorrow to
review these tickets together and see if i can begin dealing with them.

Of course i am fully aware that i haven't yet managed to deal with all the issues around knowing the
company environment but i think this very serious exercise could help me get to know the environment

even faster.

Also as i believe i should be able to bank a little bit on my recent role in cybersecurity to may be offer
some efficient solutions.

Please let me know what you think about this plan and many thanks in advance.

Thank you for your help on this.

09/12/22 11:29
Hi Claire i would have a quick question.
So as we use Azure internally for our devops pipelines, i wanted to take a quick online course about
the ways of Azure. So | already bought a course on Udemy for this and wanted to know if you would be
ok with me going through this for about a week or so. | already went through the links you sent me and

can already see a lot of similarities with AWS and GCP but i thought such a course can only make things
even easier in the short to long term.

Of course, this course will not take any precedence whatsoever on any other important activities we
might have at any time of the day.

Thank you in advance

And one last question.

i noticed the icinga alerts by email. Are we the team supposed to write some scripts to
minimize/resolve some of these issues ? | would say yes since we are in the loop but i wanted to make
sure of this.

| noticed quite a few alerts around memory issues.Are we making use of packages such as zram for
memory optimization at all ? | am asking because i know from experience that with zram deployed,
memory utilization becomes way more efficient and we will see the very same servers doing the same
job with on average less memory used.

Thank you. The course was not at all expensive as is often the case on udemy

Claire Thomson 09/12/22 12:00

The alerts can be noisy, we're tried optimising the alerts previously but they're never quite right and
we've warnings set up too. We'll be moving alerts over to icinga2 and with the migration from Centos to
Ubuntu we're not overly concerned with the memory alerts at the moment - there's also lots of
resources available should we need to add any. We're not using zram. Those alerts do fluctuate quite a
bit by email

Most of the issues tend to be with the apps not being optimised, the alerts we care about most are the
ones we have set up for SMS - the critical ones that would require something to be done immediately

yes indeed 10 is a bit too low too...there already about 5 people in our team...and that would mean
that a message could not be forwarded to more than 4 extra persons...may be they could settle for
something around may be between 30 and 50.Honestly all these subjects are most definitively

which one will be considered the system of truth ?

ire Thomson

you'd had the 26th booked automatically on timetastic by admin as the company is closed

I'll sort that in ACE
ACE is the source of truth, it's linked with the wages system
So your off the 23rd, 26th & 30th

19/12/22 16:48

Thank you so much. 26th of December is the most dangerous day of the year...retailers coming after us
in the form of massive sales. | will go into a cave on that day to avoid them.

You: Good afternoon D

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance

Jason: Ru

Of course both Sonarqube and Nexus are Open source but used by banks...the banks i was supported
not so long ago were using it.

Actually befo y message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before rfirMing it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

Hello Claire.

| have a quicl question
Edited
so regarding the sftp ticket...i am adding the possibility of having an SSL encrypted communication

between the server and the client

Now i wanted to know if it is ok , in regards to the company policy to have some self signed certificate
as they present the advantage of being as tough as we can envision them (4096 bits encryption)

Hi Claire.
| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144)/17.84.102

-username: @nold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

| am also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Marcel

A key pair, cons
a private key, is a set of security
credentials that you use to prove your
identity when connecting to an Amazon

EC2 instance. Amazon EC2 stores the
public key on your instance, and you
store the private key. For Li
the private key allows you to securely

So as you can see,Amazon does generate 2 keys, one private and one public.
The public key is kept on the server

And the private key is sent to us for authentication so we get to keep the private key.

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday....| was running
the risk of forgetting tomorrow (the ailment of old age as | come to experience it) and | wanted to
devote tomorrow to a more agile and elastic way of dynamically generate terraform steps for AWS.

Many thanks

Claire Thomson 05/02 12:01

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the
same.

To be honest trying to get users to provide an SSH key at all is often difficult @

Thanks for the message, enjoy the rest of your weekend. Hope your Uncle is still stable x

Please find above a copy of the ansible for deploying sftp servers on premises
There are just 2 little things left really:

-Fixing the odd behaviours i see when execution reaches line 144 (Ansible generation of TLS
Certificate..w||rks perfectly with bash but is misbehaving completely with Ansible)

-and obviously making use of loops once the issue with the TLS Certificate (a rather trivial task once all
is operational)

However would you be ok with a creative one liner bash script added to the package ?
Something like below to eventually circumvent the issue with the TLS generation:
#!/bin/bash

#running TLS CErtificate generation

openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out

/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -days 3650

Hello Claire.

So it is just to let you know that i went through the repository as you advised yesterday and i think i
see what you mean.

Yes the ansible i tried to push yesterday is a massive 400 lines one...that does the job and even set up
new features but does need to be broken in smaller chunks/roles .

So this is my plan if you dont mind:
-Have a session with Jason as expressed yesterday.| am just waiting for his availability for today
-Agree with him on the steps to migrate the centos sftp to ubuntu so that we are all on the same page

-And apply the same principles as above to my aws terraform ; in this regard, i already spoke to Zoe
and i think a little code reorganization wont hurt anyone. | ll try to emulate what we have under /ac-

Thanks! Cyber basically get to control what is used/not used, so unfortunately we don't get much say in
it - only when they decide something we have to implement whatever idea they've come up with good
or bad haha

I'll happily pass on your offej/should they want to take you up on it - it would be good for them to have
someone with technical imptémentation knowledge of security tools
10/05 11:00
® yes i know we just got to execute the overall plan they design..i was mentioning this just in case

they were to some days ask for the opinion of our department some days.

But if you get a chance to get them to listen, please mention to them that the easiest way to disrupt

attacks at the earliest stage is to use the package "psad" in conjonction with iptables
to disrupt attacks at the ealiest stage

Claire Thomson 10/05 11:02

yeah we have a company called Barrier that deal with intrusion detection

that's how we found out about the incident, but we've (company) a large windows estate to think of

too ®

so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS" under "aws", there will be a folder "vpc terraform version 1.3.7"

with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version 1.3.7.

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:33

why? this should all be in on
It should be along these line:
AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
o> vpe-1.tf

-- vpe-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

older, it's all still in separate folders?
iscussed

it should be "= 1.3.7"

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:44

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right &

push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that just

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an
idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them down,
each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

The reason why i initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are considered
isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for scalability and
strict isolation from each other.

Claire Thomson 23/05 15:28

yeah I'm guessing you'll have no outputs or variables, so you'll only need the main.tf and the file with
the VPC and all it's settings

it'll be much tider and easier to understand

once that's done and everything is imported and there's no changes in the plans, it will be easier to
make a module and pass in the values

Good morning Claire.| would need your help on a few little things please.

So | learnt last week that i inherited from my uncle total estate and the news came as
a shock since i did not want that and told him so many times.

But it seems to me my uncle had some surprises for me in store even when not around.

So i inherited from his flat in Paris and his mansion in Abidjan-Cocody .

f i could be authorised to work remotely from outside of the UK for a couple of weeks in

| can obviously ensure you that i will have access to a reliable internet connection in
both countries and a very safe environment to work in.

In Paris, i will be staying in the area called "La defense" and in the Ivory Coast,
| will be in Cocody precisely in my late uncle place which is below:

from this comes with lots pf problems...i already have some of my...

that's awful, I've had many fr s have similar situations - families can be mean. Everyone is hurting
and you've not asked for it

Claire Thomson 30/05 12:29

Can you also remember in addition to pushing changes to git - you also need to pull changes from
master into your branch to keep it up to date please

you will be OK as no one else is working in the area you are at moment - but if we don't do it elsewhere
we would get really bad merge conflicts to resolve.

@ Sorry Claire...believe me when i say that i was thinking about this this morning. OK i just wrote a
little script of 10 lines that will take care of that so that i cannot forget no matter what...i now
completed the incorporation of the changes from master into the branch

Hi Claire.

I think i did nterpret this comment from you the last time we had a chat about the terraform for
the vpc:

= Claire Thomson 19/05 11
So why? this should all be in one folder, it's all

It should be along these lines as discussed
AWS

in separate folders?

(contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)

vpe-1.tf
= vpe-2.tf
- variables.tf
— output.tf

it should be "= 1.3.7"

This si why i was going that route

but what is finally asked is pretty straightforward

and will ha dana hu tamarrauws i think i am aleasdw an it

No worries, | did follow that {\on a catchup and actually make the changes to show you and said we

That's why draft PRs are good and we can discuss what's happening )

yes indeed we are and this way is even easier @

Claire Thomson 06/06 16:19

e ‘If we created a module we'd have a single variable file and pass the values into that, but yes definitely
= not needed at the moment - purely just defined in the tf files for each VPC

Was looking into the random VPC that were in places that we didn't know about, they are default ones

(says yes under default in the UI ) they are managed differently with terraform
https: //registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/default_vpc

we can look through all this tmw
