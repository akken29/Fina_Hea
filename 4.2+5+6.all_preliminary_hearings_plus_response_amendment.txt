NOTE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY HEARING

1. The claimant was employed by the respondent as a Dev Ops Engineer from 7
December 2022 until 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from home. Following
the termination of his employment, the claimant notified ACAS of his intention
to make an application to the Employment Tribunal on 31 July 2023. The
claimant received an early conciliation certificate from ACAS on 4 September
2023 and presented an application to the Employment Tribunal on 25
September 2023 in which he claimed unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, race
discrimination and subjection to detriment and dismissal by reason of having

made a protected disclosure.

List of Issues Claimant wishes to raise

 

2. | went through the issues the claimant had raised in his ET1 and PH Agenda.
On behalf of the respondent, Mr Meechan submitted that the claimant had
raised issues in his PH Agenda and at the PH today which were not in his ET1.
Mr Meechan submitted that these additional issues would require to be the
subject of an application by the claimant to amend the ET1 and that the
respondent would be likely to oppose such an application. This was discussed
and we agreed that | would issue this Note setting out the claimant's claims as
understood following today’s discussions. Mr Meechan would then have 7 days
from his receipt of this Note within which to indicate which claims he challenged
as not foreshadowed in the ET1. Thereafter, the claimant would have 14 days
from Mr Meechan’s challenge within which to make any application to amend.
The issues raised were as follows:

Direct Discrimination

 

1. Did the respondent, because of the claimant’s race, treat the claimant less
favourably than it would have treated others? The less favourable treatment
alleged by the claimant is as follows. The claimant will say that:

a. Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer was permitted by the claimant’s line
manager Claire Thomson and second line manager, David Moffat to
behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the claimant
in the manner described below at video meetings at which they were
present and to humiliate the claimant without any steps being taken

to challenge his behaviour. By contrast, the claimant was subjected to
the respondent’s performance procedure and dismissed.

b. On or about 13 June 2023 the claimant’s line manager, Claire
Thomson misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with
the claimant that day.

c. HR did not follow the respondent’s performance procedure in relation
to the claimant;

d. The claimant sent the code he had written to David Moffat to check.
Despite being a software developer, Mr Moffat did not check the
claimant’s code.

e. The claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
meeting at which he was dismissed indicating prejudgment.

f. The claimant was dismissed on grounds of poor performance. He will
argue that, as his performance was not poor, he was dismissed
because of his race.

2. The claimant’s comparators are Jason White and other white employees of
the respondent.

Harassment

3. Did the claimant suffer unwanted conduct as follows? The claimant will say
that:

a. Over a period between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason
White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the claimant repeatedly at daily
team meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”; belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of
others. In particular, at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White
criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS which involved a
modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those
present and mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you're
doing. Let me tell you one more time..”

4. Was this related to the claimant’s race?

5. If so, did this conduct have the purpose or effect of violating his dignity,
or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive

environment for the claimant?

Indirect Discrimination

 

6. Did the respondent apply the practice of not adequately evaluating
performance in the claimant's department, so as to obtain objective

information upon which performance could be assessed with transparency ?

7. Was that practice applied to white and non-white employees in the claimant's
department?

8. Did the practice put (or would it put) non-white employees in the claimant’s
department at a particular disadvantage compared with white employees in
that the lack of transparency and objective information about performance
fostered an environment where racial prejudices may influence employment

decisions?

9. Did it put the claimant at that disadvantage?

10.If so, was the practice a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?

Victimization

11.Did the claimant do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under
section 27(2)(c) or (d) Equality Act 2010? The claimant will say that:

a. On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice.
[Claimant’s PH Agenda paragraph S.8(f).]

a. Dismissing the claimant for alleged poor performance.

Whistleblowing

13.Did the claimant make the following disclosures and if so, were they
protected disclosures as defined in sections 43B and 43C Employment
Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”)?: The claimant will say that:

a. On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. On or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of the
respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his
manager Claire Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying
passwords from the old system to the new one was contrary to the
respondent's legal obligations following a cyber security breach.

c. On or about 19 June 2023, the claimant emailed Claire Thomson,
David Moffat and the respondent’s HR department to report on-going
verbal abuse by Mr White as well as alleged IT malpractice and
breach of the respondent's legal obligations relating to data
protection.

procedures for managing performance without any proper basis for

doing so.

15.Was the claimant subjected to the above detriment contrary to section 47B

ERA because he had made one or more of the above protected disclosures?

Automatically Unfair Dismissal

 

16. The claimant does not have the necessary two years’ qualifying service to

a protected disclosure contrary to section 103A ERA?

Wrongful Dismissal

18. Was the claimant’s dismissal in breach of his contract?

NOTE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY HEARING

The claimant was employed by the respondent as a ‘Dev Ops Engineer’ from 7
December 2022 until 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from home. Having
notified Acas of his intention to bring this claim on 31 July 2023 and having
received from them an early conciliation certificate on 4 September 2023, he
presented an application to the Employment Tribunal on 25 September 2023 in
which he claimed automatically unfair dismissal, race discrimination and
subjection to detriment and dismissal by reason of having made a protected
disclosure.

A case management preliminary hearing took place on 27 November 2023 at
which the issues the claimant had raised in his ET1 and PH agenda were
discussed. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Meechan submitted that the claimant
had raised issues in his PH Agenda and at the PH itself which were not in his ET1.
Mr Meechan submitted that these additional issues would require to be the subject
of an application by the claimant to amend the ET1 and that the respondent would
be likely to oppose such an application. This was discussed and it was agreed
that | would issue the PH Note recording the claimant’s claims as understood
following our discussions. Mr Meechan would then have 7 days from his receipt
of the PH Note within which to indicate which claims he challenged as not
sufficiently foreshadowed in the ET1 and thereby requiring amendment.
Thereafter, the claimant would have 14 days from Mr Meechan’s challenge within
which to make any application to amend.

. Mr Meechan sent an email to the tribunal, copied to the claimant on 8 December

2023 in which he accepted that the ET1 contained claims of whistleblowing
detriment (section 47B Employment Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”)) and automatically
unfair dismissal (section 103A ERA) and that the information recorded in the PH
Note amounted to further and better particulars of those claims. However, he
argued that the remaining claims were not grounded in the ET1 and submitted
that the claimant would require to amend to incorporate them. In correspondence
dated 22 December 2023, the claimant disputed that the claims in question were
not grounded in the ET1. He argued that they were so grounded. This PH was
fixed to (i) determine that issue; and (ii) if amendment was held to be required, to
determine the claimant’s application to amend, which he confirmed was in the

terms recorded in the PH Note of 27 November 2023 as detailed in the next two

numbered paragraphs below. The issues the claimant seeks to have determined
and the particulars the claimant seeks to add, and to which Mr Meechan objects

are as follows:

“Direct Discrimination

A. Did the respondent, because of the claimant’s race, treat the claimant less
favourably than it would have treated others? The less favourable treatment
alleged by the claimant is as follows. The claimant will say that:

the respondent's performance procedure and dismissed.

b. On or about 13 June 2023 the claimant’s line manager, Claire
Thomson misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with

because of his race.

The claimant’s comparators are Jason White and other white employees of
the respondent.
Harassment

B. Did the claimant suffer unwanted conduct as follows? The claimant will say
that:

Victimization

D. Did the claimant do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under
section 27(2)(c) or (d) Equality Act 2010? The claimant will say that:

a. Onorabout 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice.
[Claimant’s PH Agenda paragraph S.8(f).]

Was the claimant subjected to the following detriment, and if so, was it

because he had done the protected act?

c. Dismissing the claimant for alleged poor performance.

Wrongful Dismissal

E. Was the claimant’s dismissal in breach of his contract?”

4. The following issues and particulars are not objected to by Mr Meechan and are
received as issues for determination at the hearing and as the claimant’s further

was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. Onor about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of the
respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his
manager Claire Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying
passwords from the old system to the new one was contrary to the
respondent's legal obligations following a cyber security breach.

c. On or about 19 June 2023, the claimant emailed Claire Thomson,
David Moffat and the respondent’s HR department to report on-going

Was the claimant subjected to the following detriment? The claimant will say
that:

d. Management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent’s
procedures for managing performance without any proper basis for

doing so.

Was the claimant subjected to the above detriment contrary to section 47B
ERA because he had made one or more of the above protected disclosures?

Automatically Unfair Dismissal

G. The claimant does not have the necessary two years’ qualifying service to
claim ‘ordinary’ unfair dismissal. Thus, the questions is whether his dismissal

was for an inadmissible reason making it automatically unfair:

Was the claimant dismissed for the reason or principal reason that he made
a protected disclosure contrary to section 103A ERA?”

Issue (i) - Whether the claims objected to are in the claimant’s ET1.

5. | am required to consider the claimant’s ET1 as a whole. In his ET1, the claimant
ticked the following boxes in section 8.1: ‘unfair dismissal’, ‘race discrimination’,
‘whistleblowing’ and ‘another type of claim’, which he stated was “harassment”. In
section 8.2, which asks for the details of the claim, the claimant typed two
paragraphs. After some background about the claimant’s job, the following detail
was given: “Just a week prior to my unexpected dismissal, my manager expressed
satisfaction with my work and awaited my code submission. However, | received
an abrupt HR letter alleging poor performance - a matter never discussed with my
manager. | can corroborate this with comprehensive digital records of all
managerial interactions, made possible due to my remote work nature. //
Suspiciously, my dismissal followed a complaint | raised about a colleague's
violent behaviour, endorsed by my manager. HR was made aware but seemed
unresponsive, with their demeanour suggesting they weren't interested in a fair
appraisal. Throughout, | felt dehumanised and witnessed a constructed narrative
to unjustly terminate me. | observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and
my manager, which | can substantiate. The ordeal left me mentally shattered,
questioning my self-worth and life. Notably, I'm aware of others in the company
whose genuine incompetence endangered the business and staff, yet they remain
shielded.”

6. In section 9.2, the ET1 contains the following statements so far as relevant to the
current dispute: “Compensation: “My claims to this tribunal are for the following
facts: - direct and indirect discrimination - wrongful and unfair dismissal —

organized harassment.”

7. Put shortly, Mr Meechan argues that the claims of direct and _ indirect
discrimination, harassment, victimization and wrongful dismissal set out above are
not sufficiently foreshadowed or grounded in the ET1 so as to form heads of claim.
He cites the case of Baker v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis

 

UKEAT0201/09 in support of his argument. In that case, an employment tribunal
at first instance had stated: “We reached the view that although the Claimant
ticked the box marked 'Disability' in section 6 of that claim form, nowhere in the
notes attached to the claim form (which as mentioned above, contain a list of
events in reverse chronological order) does the Claimant make a complaint which

63

10

35

Case No: : 8000485/2023 Page 8

is recognisably a complaint of disability discrimination.” At paragraph 54 of the
Judgment on appeal, the EAT held: “/n our judgment the ET correctly considered
the first ET1 as a whole. It came to a conclusion which was open to it. Whilst the
particulars given in the ET1 raised a recognisable case of race discrimination, the
Claimant did not say that the discrimination alleged had anything to do with his
learning difficulties or dyslexia. Neither did the Claimant say that any or any
specific adjustments should have been made for him by reason of his disability.
Accordingly whilst recognising that a technical approach to the question of
whether a particular claim is raised in an ET1 is inappropriate, on the facts of this
case the ET did not err in law or come to a perverse conclusion in holding that,
read as a whole, the first ET1 did not include a claim of disability discrimination.”
Mr Meechan submitted that the Baker case made clear that in order for a claim to
be in an ET1 a claimant needed to do more than tick a box. There needed to be
a nexus between the factual allegations and the protected characteristic. Applying
that to this case, Mr Meechan submitted that there was no nexus between the
claimant’s factual allegations and his race. | considered the ET1 as a whole. The
claimant has ticked the box for race discrimination. In the compensation section
he refers to “direct and indirect discrimination, wrongful and unfair dismissal and
organized harassment”. No further relevant details are given in section 9.2. In
section 8.2 where he is asked to include the details of his claim, the claimant
indicates that poor performance was suddenly alleged out of the blue by HR in
circumstances where his manager had expressed satisfaction with his work. He
states that his dismissal followed a complaint he made about a colleague’s
behaviour, of which HR was made aware but seemed unresponsive. He states
that there was “a constructed narrative to unjustly terminate me’ and continues: “/
observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and my manager which | can
substantiate.” He suggests that he was less favourably treated than others in the

company.

8. The IDS Handbook on Employment Tribunal Practice and Procedure (November
2023 Edition) states at paragraph 9.15: “Whether a formal amendment is required
will depend essentially on whether the claim form...sufficiently particularises the
essential complaint.. that the claimant ... seeks to make.” Commenting on the
Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ali v Office of National Statistics 2005 IRLR
201 CA, the paragraph goes on “/t was necessary for claimants to set out the
specific acts complained of, as tribunals were only able to adjudicate on specific

complaints. A general description of the complaint in the ET1 will therefore not

Employment Law (Division PI Practice and Procedure; 1. Employment Tribunals;
|. The claim, its presentation to the tribunal and amendments to the claim; (2)
Presenting the claim; (b) The requirements for and importance of pleading the

182 (8 December 2022, unreported), the ratio of Chandhok is that the parties are
only required to set out the essence of their case in the pleadings. They do not

need to set out every fact and evidential matter in support of their case.”

9. Having considered parties’ submissions, | have come to the conclusion that the
bare bones of the claims of direct race discrimination and race related
victimisation are present in the ET1. The claimant complains about his treatment
by HR and his manager. He says that he witnessed a “constructed narrative to
unjustly terminate me”. He states: “/ observed racial undertones in the actions of
HR and my manager, which | can substantiate.” He then compares his treatment

to that of others. However, the claims require further particularisation.

10.With regard to the claim of race related harassment, the claimant refers to “a
complaint about a colleague’s violent behaviour”. When | inquired what this meant
at the PH on 27 November 2023 (standing the fact that the claimant was a remote
worker), the claimant said that he was talking about ‘verbal violence’. The
particulars of this provided by the claimant in his PH agenda and in discussion at
the PH suggested that the alleged speech complained of was rude, disrespectful,
mocking or patronising rather than violent. In any event, it is clear from the ET1
that the claimant had had issues with a colleague’s behaviour but it is not clear
that this aspect was said to be related to race. Thus, | do not find that the complaint
of race related harassment was in the ET1.

11.1 agree with Mr Meechan that the ET1 does not contain sufficient to amount to
even the essence of a claim of indirect race discrimination and that that claim as
now particularised is not discernible from the ET1. The same goes for the claim

of wrongful dismissal.

Issue (ii) - The claimant’s application to amend

12.The claimant confirmed that the substance of his application to amend is as
recorded in the Note of the 27 November PH and set out at paragraph 3 A to G
above. Applying the Selkent test, having regard to the interests of justice, |
considered the submissions of the parties and all the relevant circumstances of
the case. | weighed the relative injustice and hardship that would be caused to the
parties by allowing or refusing the amendment application. | have addressed the

relevant circumstances below:

The nature of the proposed amendments

13. With regard to the nature of the claimant’s proposed amendments, for the reasons
given above, | have concluded that the claims of less favourable treatment
because of race (direct race discrimination) and race related victimisation are
discernible from the ET1. Thus in relation to those claims, the amendment
provides significant further particularisation of existing claims. With regard to the
claim of race related harassment, although the word ‘harassment’ appears in the
ET1, the ET1 does not contain a discernible claim of harassment related to race
for the reasons explained above. The indirect discrimination claim is also not
discernible, nor is wrongful dismissal. Thus the nature of these latter amendments
is that they are substantial amendments which plead new heads of claim. (| would
add here that, in addition to being foreshadowed in the ET1, the race related
victimisation claim seeks to place an alternative label on some of the facts
accepted without objection in relation to the whistleblowing claim. Whilst, as Mr
Meechan submitted, those two cases may be inconsistent, it appeared to me that
they ascribe to the respondent alternative reasons for the conduct complained of
and are being put forward as alternative cases.)

The applicability of time limits

14. Although the claims identified above as being new heads of claim were set out in
the PH agenda presented on 5 November 2023, amendment was not discussed
until the PH itself on 27 November. New claims sought to be introduced by an
application to amend on 27 November 2023 would be out of time. The reason
given by the claimant for not including basic information regarding these claims in

66

the ET1 was that he had encountered an error message when completing online
the answer to the “other types of claim’ question at the end of the tick boxes in
section 8.1. He enclosed a screenshot stating: “Description must be 100
characters or less” and telling him he had 8 characters remaining. He said that
this error had had an impact on his approach to filling out the form in that it had
led him to adopt a more concise and focused approach to completing the form.
He said he was compelled to focus his claims to their most essential elements.
Whilst | understood that the claimant had been constrained in answering the
question about other types of claims, | did not understand him to indicate that he
had faced a similar character limit in answering question 8.2 (which asks for the
details of the claims) and he did not produce an error message for that question.
For those reasons, | did not find this explanation especially persuasive. However,
it is fair to note that the claimant is representing himself. He does not have a legal
background and this is a complex area of law. | accept that the legal issues arising
in relation to the different heads of discrimination are easier to address with the
help of the PH agenda. Treated as a discrete claim, the race related harassment
claim would have had to be notified to Acas by 18 September 2023. The wrongful
dismissal and indirect discrimination claims would have had to be notified by 21
September 2023. The application to amend was on 27 November 2023, thus it

was just over two months out of time.

The timing and manner of the application

15.With regard to the timing and manner of the application, the claimant first notified
the content of these heads of claim to the respondent in his PH agenda sent on 5
November 2023. This content was then discussed and recorded in the Note of
the PH on 27 November 2023. Although the claims were presented two months
out of time, the case was at an early stage. At the time of presenting his ET1, the
claimant did not have the benefit of legal representation or assistance. Some of
the facts put forward for the harassment claim are also pled in the whistleblowing
detriment and automatically unfair dismissal claims and are already accepted for
amendment without objection in relation to those claims. The same witnesses
would be required to talk about the same basic allegations. The specific details of
the harassment claim would be likely to be covered in the evidence of the relevant
witnesses anyway because they are the details of the complaint about a colleague
referred to by the claimant in the ET1.

16.With regard to the balance of injustice and hardship, the claimant submitted that
the prejudice to him if the amendment were refused would be massive. He would
lose the opportunity to make a claim of discrimination. Mr Meechan submitted that
the proposed amendment contained new and distinct heads of claim. If the
respondent had to answer the new claims this would involve much more work and
expense. He said the new claims would involve different evidence and different
witnesses. He pointed out that even if the amendment were refused, the claimant
would still have his whistleblowing detriment and dismissal cases and if
successful, he would be entitled to a remedy. Mr Meechan said that the indirect
discrimination claim was inconsistent with the direct discrimination claim in relation
to whether HR had followed the performance procedure. He also submitted that
the claims the claimant now sought to introduce had little reasonable prospect of
success. Mr Meechan said that with regard to the direct discrimination and
harassment claims, the claimant’s case was that the person concerned acted in
the same way to everyone. He submitted that if that was the claimant’s position,
he would be unlikely to show that he had been treated less favourably than others
because of his race. Whilst this may be so, as the higher courts continually remind
us, it is difficult and inadvisable to make try to an assessment of the facts of a

discrimination claim without hearing the evidence.

17.1 considered the interests of justice in this case and the balance of injustice and
hardship. | concluded that in relation to the claims of direct discrimination and race
related victimisation, the amendments should be allowed. | considered that these
claims were discernible from the ET1. For the reasons given above, it appeared
to me that it was just discernible from the ET1 that the claimant was claiming that
he had been treated less favourably and that his race was a reason for that. |
accept, as Mr Meechan submitted that this would sound in expense and extra
work for the respondent. However, it appeared to me that the witnesses the
respondent would require to call and the facts alleged for these claims and also
for the harassment claim were similar to those of the whistleblowing detriment and
automatically unfair dismissal claims. With regard to the victimization claim, this
is really an alternative label for some of the facts of the whistleblowing claim (as
Mr Meechan pointed out). Thus, on balance, | concluded that the amendments in
respect of the claims of direct race discrimination, race related harassment and
race related victimisation should be allowed. In my view the relevant evidence

would require to be led at the hearing anyway. The balance of injustice and

hardship favours the claimant in relation to these claims. It would be a greater
hardship for him to be denied the opportunity to have potentially valid claims heard
than it would be for the respondent to defend them.

18.However, | concluded that the balance of injustice and hardship favoured refusing
the application to amend in respect of the remaining claims of indirect
discrimination and wrongful dismissal. These claims, although mentioned in the
ET1 were not foreshadowed in it to the extent required. The indirect discrimination
claim would require new evidence to be gathered which would not otherwise be
required. The claimant will have the opportunity to have his other discrimination
claims heard. The wrongful dismissal claim is not particularised to any extent and
the respondent doe not have fair notice of the particulars of this claim.
Furthermore, as Mr Meechan points out, since a contract can be terminated at
common law by means of the notice clause, contractual notice is normally the
extent of the measure of loss in such a claim. If either of the claimant’s claims of
automatically unfair or race related dismissal were to succeed, the notice period
would be covered by the corresponding remedy for loss in any event.

19.The case will now proceed to the full hearing on 25 April 2024. Orders for
preparation for that hearing have already been issued.

IN THE GLASGOW EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL

Case Number 8000485/2023

 

 

M SANGARE
Claimant
against

ARNOLD CLARK AUTOMOBILES LIMITED

Respondent
RESPONSE TO 6.1 — PAPER APART (AMENDED MARCH 2024)
1 THE PARTIES

1.1 The Claimant was employed by Amold Clark Automobiles Limited.

1.2 The Respondent is an automotive retailer operating more than 200 branches throughout the
UK. The Respondent employs approximately 10,000 members of staff.

1.3 The Claimant was employed by the Respondent, as a Dev Ops Engineer, from 7 December

2022 until 22 June 2023. The Claimant was based at the Respondent’s head office at
Hillington, Glasgow, with remote working from home.

1.4 The Claimant’s employment contract provided that the Claimant was entitled to one week’s
notice for each complete year of service, up to maximum of twelve weeks; and that the
Respondent reserved the right to terminate employment immediately by making a payment of
basic salary in lieu of notice.

2 PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Time Bar
2.1 The Respondent reserves its position in respect of time bar.
2.2 To the extent that any relevant acts or omissions occurred more than three months before the

presentation of the Claim Form on 25 September 2023 (subject to the extension of time as a
result of the interplay with the Early Conciliation regime from 31 July 2023 to 4 September

2023) the claims have been brought out with the time limits. Accordingly, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear such claims.

2.3 Based on the information currently available, it is denied that any allegations of discrimination
set out in the claim form part of a continuing act ending within the relevant time limit under
section 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010 (‘the 2010 Act’), or that it would be just and
equitable for the tribunal to extend time for submission of the claim under section 123(1)(b)

of the Act.
3 THE CLAIMANT’S PERFORMANCE/CAPABILITY
3.1 The Claimant’s line manager, Claire Thomson (Digital Product Development Technical

Lead), contacted the Respondent’s People Team on 12 June 2023 with concerns in relation to
the Claimant’s performance.

3.2 On 14 June 2023, Laura Cooper (People Advisor in the Respondent’s People Team) invited
the Claimant to a meeting to discuss the Claimant’s performance and continued employment.
The invite letter warned the Claimant that termination of employment was a possible outcome;
confirmed who would attend the meeting; and advised the Claimant that he could be
accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative.

3.3 In particular, and as the Claimant was advised, the Respondent had concerns about the
Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and to
perform the tasks expected in the Claimant’s role to the standards expected.

3.4 The Continued Employment meeting was held on 20 June 2023 and was chaired by Laura
Cooper. David Middleton (Head of Digital Talent) was present as management representative
and the Claimant chose to be unaccompanied. Due to time constraints the meeting was
adjourned and reconvened on 22 June 2023.

3.5 The Respondent’s concerns were discussed in detail with the Claimant and he was given the
opportunity to respond and put forward any mitigation.

3.6 During the adjournment, Laura Cooper discussed some of the Claimant’s allegations with
Claire Thomson. After doing so, she was satisfied that the Respondent’s concerns in relation
to the Claimant’s performance were well founded and that dismissal was the appropriate
outcome of the meeting.

3.7 The Respondent decided to terminate the Claimant’s employment, and this was confirmed to
the Claimant by letter on 22 June 2023 (the letter was dated 1 September 2023 in error). The
letter confirmed that his last date of employment was 22 June 2023 and the Claimant was
informed of his right to appeal.

3.8 The reason for the termination of employment was capability and specifically in relation to

the Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and
to performance the tasks expected in his role to the standards expected.

Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

3.9 The Claimant did not appeal against the termination of his employment.
4 OTHER ALLEGATIONS

4.1 It is denied that the Claimant’s manager never expressed concerns with the Claimant’s
performance. While the Respondent’s performance concerns had not been addressed formally
with the Claimant until the Continued Employment process, the Claimant’s line manager had
raised concerns with the Claimant informally, including pointing out to him occasions on
which tasks had not been completed properly and corrections had to be made.

4.2 The Claimant did not raise a grievance about any of the allegations in his ET1, or otherwise.

43 It is denied that the Claimant formally complained about “a colleague’s violent behaviour’;
or that this was “endorsed” by his manager’; or that it had anything to do with his dismissal.
The Claimant was dismissed because of his poor performance.

4.4 It is denied that there was a “constructed narrative to unjustly terminate” the Claimant. The
Claimant was dismissed, in accordance with the Respondent’s relevant procedures, because
of capability. It is denied that there were any “racial undertones in the actions of HR and [the
Claimant’s manager” or that race was relevant in any way to the process followed and/or the
termination of the Claimant’s employment.

4.5 It denied that the Respondent has “shielded” “others in the company whose genuine
incompetence endangered the business and staff.”

5 AUTOMATICALLY UNFAIR DISMISSAL

5.1 It is denied that the Claimant was automatically unfairly dismissed because he allegedly made
a protected disclosure.

5.2 The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as explained in section 3 above.

6 WHISTLEBLOWING DETRIMENT

6.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to a detriment contrary to section 47B of the
Employment Rights Act 1996 because he made one or more protected disclosures, as alleged
or at all.

6.2 In particular,

6.2.1 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the
claimant told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had
spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to
insecurity in the department and was having an effect on his own health and safety
and on that of the whole team". The claimant did say that he was not comfortable
with the way Jason White had spoken to him, and that he found it condescending,

72


--- New Page 4 ---
Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

but he did not mention anything about it being “insulting, abusive and violent” or
having any impact on “health and safety”.

6.2.2 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of
the respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his manager Claire
Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying passwords from the old system
to the new one was contrary to the respondent’s legal obligations following a cyber
security breach”. The claimant did raise an issue with the practice of copying
passwords, but he did not say to Claire Thomson that he considered this to be in
breach of any legal obligation and the process and reason for it was explained to him
by Claire Thomson.

6.2.3 It is accepted that the Claimant emailed Claire Thomson, David Moffat and the
Respondent’s HR department on 19 June 2023, in which he complained about how
Mr White had spoken to him. However, it is denied that this amounted to a protected
disclosure. It is also denied that the Claimant made allegations of “IT malpractice
and breach of the respondent’s legal obligations relating to data protection” in this
email. It is accepted that the Claimant made suggestions about how the Respondent
could improve its coding practices and IT “hygiene”, but the email did not allege
any breach of legal obligations in this regard, whether related to data protection or
otherwise.

6.2.4 It is denied that the disclosures referred to in paragraphs 6.2.1 to 6.2.3 above
occurred as alleged by the Claimant and furthermore on either the Claimant or
Respondent’s version of the alleged ‘disclosures’, the relevant ‘disclosures’ were
not protected disclosures for the purposes of the Employment Rights Act 1996.

6.3 It is denied that “management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent’s procedures for managing
performance without any proper basis for doing so.” The Claimant’s dismissal was not
predetermined and the decision to dismiss was made in accordance with the Respondent’s
usual practice in the circumstances, including inviting the Claimant to a ‘continued
employment’ meeting to discuss the Respondent’s concerns before making its decision.

6.4 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was subjected to the above alleged detriment, which is
denied, it is denied that this was because he made a protected disclosure.

7 DIRECT RACE DISCRIMINATION

7.1 It is denied that the Respondent treated the Claimant less favourably that it would have treated
others, because of race, as alleged or at all.

7.2 In particular:
7.2.1 It is denied that Claire Thomson (the Claimant’s line manager) and David Moffat

(the Claimant’s second line manager) permitted Jason White (Dev Ops Engineer) to

ACTIVE: 118707365v1 4

73


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the Claimant during video
meetings at which they were present and to humiliate the Claimant without
challenging Jason White’s behaviour. It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed
because of performance and Jason White was not, under explanation that this was
because the Respondent did not have the same concerns about Jason White’s
performance as it did with the Claimant.

7.2.2 It is denied that, on or about 13 June 2023, Claire Thomson misrepresented to HR
what had happened at a meeting with the Claimant that day.

7.2.3 The Claimant says the Respondent did not follow its performance procedure in
relation to the Claimant. The Respondent does not operate a standalone performance
procedure but follows its disciplinary procedure in circumstances where there are
concerns about performance. As set out in the disciplinary procedure, the procedure
will not normally apply in the case of employees with less than 24 months’ service.
In those circumstances, the Respondent’s practice is to hold a ‘continued
employment’ meeting with the employee at which the concerns are discussed, and
the employee is given an opportunity to respond to those concerns before any
decision is made. This is what happened in the Claimant’s case.

7.2.4 It is accepted that the Claimant sent code in an email which was copied to David
Moffat on 19 June 2023 and that David Moffat did not check the code. However, it
is denied that the code was sent to David Moffat “to check.” It was included in an
email sent to Laura Cooper and David Middleton, as the people who would be
involved in the Claimant’s continued employment meeting the next day, raising a
number of different points and issues. David Moffat was not due to attend that
meeting and did not consider he was expected to check the code. In any event, David
Moffat’s not checking the code was not because of race.

7.2.5 It is denied that the Claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
continued employment meeting. It is explained that when an employee is dismissed
by the Respondent, AXA benefits are cancelled following dismissal but to take
effect from the day before the last day of employment.

7.2.6 It is denied that the Claimant was dismissed because of his race. The Claimant was
dismissed because of capability, as explained at section 3 above.

7.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was treated less favourably, as alleged above, it is
denied that this was because of race.

7.4 It is denied that the Claimant’s comparators, namely “Jason White and other white employees
of the Respondent” are appropriate comparators. An appropriate comparator is someone in
relation to whom there is no material difference between the circumstances (except for the
existence of the protected characteristic).

8 RACE RELATED HARASSMENT

8.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to harassment related to race, as alleged or at all,
in terms of section 26 of the 2010 Ac.

8.2 It is denied that the Claimant suffered unwanted conduct, as alleged, namely: “Over a period
between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the
Claimant repeatedly at daily meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”, belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of others. In particular,
at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS
which involved a modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those present and
mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you’re doing. Let me tell you one more
time.”

8.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did suffer the alleged unwanted conduct, it is denied
that it was related to race; and/or that it had the purpose or effect of violating the Claimant’s
dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
for the Claimant, and/or that it was reasonable for the Claimant to regard it as having that

effect.
9 VICTIMISATION
9.1 It is denied that the Respondent has subjected the Claimant to a detriment because he did a

protected act, in terms of section 27 of the 2010 Act.

9.2 It is denied that on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the Claimant told
his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had spoken to him at the
meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to insecurity in the department
and was having an effect on his own health and safety and that of the whole team.” In any
event, it is denied that this is capable of amounting to a protected act in terms of section 27 of
the 2010 Act.

9.3 It is denied that the Claimant submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice. It is accepted that this will
amount to a protected act if the Tribunals finds this did happen (which is denied).

9.4 It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed but it is denied that this was because he did a
protected act, as alleged or at all. The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as
explained at section 3 above.

10 REMEDY

10.1 It is denied that the Claimant is entitled to any of the remedies sought within the ET1 Claim
Form.

10.2 If the Tribunal finds that any compensation is due to the Claimant, the Respondent contends
that this should be reduced to reflect:

10.2.1 Section 123 of the Employment Rights Act 1996;
10.2.2 the principles set out in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd [1987] IRLR 503;
10.2.3. the Claimant’s contribution to any dismissal found to have taken place;

10.2.4 any failure found to have occurred in respect of any applicable provisions of the
ACAS Code of Practice relating to disciplinary and grievances, namely the Claimant
did not appeal his dismissal, nor did he raise a grievance;

10.2.5 any failure by the Claimant to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses;
and/or

10.2.6 any earnings received by the Claimant subsequent to the termination of his
employment by way of alternative employment, state benefits or otherwise.

10.3 The Claimant is called upon to provide a detailed Schedule of Loss, showing the details of
any compensation sought, together with details of all income (including state benefits)
claimed and/or received, and all steps taken to mitigate his alleged losses since his
employment with the Respondent ended.

10.4 At Section 9.1 of the ET1 Claim Form, the Claimant seeks a recommendation. It is unclear
what recommendation is sought but in any event, it is denied that it would be appropriate for
the tribunal to make a recommendation given that the Claimant is no longer employed by the

Respondent.
11 GENERAL
11.1 Save as set out above no admissions are made in relation to the claim form and the grounds

of claim or remedies sought.
