1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 the Linux servers are actually doing and where they send the emails, whatever that is fine.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
 I know, I know, but if they want to have a discussion.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
 The operational emails, the reporting emails.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,800
 I know.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
 Colin did actually mention apparently there's some concern about customer data.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
 So there's no customer data coming out of those emails.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
 The only thing we had with customer data was that builds server which has gone now.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
 Yep. No, I don't know.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
 So like I was giving him that.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,440
 I was like fair enough. It's saying that every single is like opening up a huge section.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,160
 That's cool. I don't mind.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,920
 You can have a chat, but I was like, I was like, there's no, there's no network rules here.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,080
 This is basically, and it was like the question was, it was like, it's fine.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,160
 All I need is no network rules.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,200
 We're just using 365 as a really for Prisma Cloud and all I need is the Prisma Cloud email address

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,080
 enabled again, to send like it used to.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,680
 And they're like, oh, that, like, would it work?

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
 Like two factors needed for 365 emails.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
 No, not all of them.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,400
 You don't have to be.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,960
 We can make it.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,360
 So yeah, now I have to have the phone call about that.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
 So, yeah.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,480
 Yeah. So, I'm still going to be working on this.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,720
 So this is going to probably end up bigger than what Ross and that started out with.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,360
 And because we've got to look at the encryption stuff and I was having a chat

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
 recalling about it this morning.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
 Apparently, what the what's the sort of?

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,800
 Oh, sorry.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,040
 I know I just started waffling on about database users that automating database users when we're

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,920
 creating the databases.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,320
 So like the, the, the, the database users is probably the simple bit, but there's obviously

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 certain databases have like encryption required.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,760
 So that will have to get tacked on somehow on top of it.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 And then Colin, Colin's obviously wanting to review the actual accounts that are there

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,160
 because there was some people that had like DBO to start off with.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,680
 The BI team, somebody created them, one after sales guys or somebody had created them at some

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,360
 point, a data services reader and they were hooking directly from on-prem to

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
 does your databases to pull data.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 And obviously that's not supposed to be happening.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,760
 And isn't that, no, no, it's like, if they were doing it, they would be looking at a view

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
 at the, at the most, but they weren't.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 It was a user on the work on stuff directly from databases rather than a view.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
 So that I, they shouldn't have a reader.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,480
 So like God knows how that happened.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,920
 Yeah.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,080
 So I would need to, why don't we just turn on encryption for all the databases by default

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,480
 anyway?

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,240
 Well, see that, that might be where we go.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
 But obviously Colin is one.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,200
 That's what I'll very likely end up doing with, with replacement canary pastures.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
 We prove a concept of that with that, that BI replica cluster.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
 Yes.

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
 That rest encryption.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,000
 I couldn't get TLS working.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,520
 I think now that it's been a few years, I could probably get that going.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
 Yeah.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,000
 So I saw obviously like Colin wants a bit more input around about the database.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,320
 Stuff, which is fine because that's don't have an issue with that.

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,800
 Dave's.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,720
 So the plan for that after sales event store stuff is next Thursday night, Greg's on call.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
 So we'll leave it to Greg.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
 I'll do that.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,320
 I mean, it should just be a case of taking, stopping the nodes,

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,880
 changing the config, turning the other three nodes, well, all the nodes back on,

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,160
 and they should just all sync up.

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,440
 I don't think there's any more complicated to that.

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,320
 It should just work.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
 Might take a while for them to sync back up.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
 It should get there.

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,080
 Yeah, 10 pages.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,640
 I might.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,120
 Yeah.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 So I've estimated two hours on that.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,800
 So there'll be an outage window at night.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
 I don't even think, are you being holiday next week anyway?

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,240
 I know.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
 It'll be more than two hours.

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
 Possibly.

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
 It'll be interesting.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 And like you'll need to kick it off and just go to bed.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,320
 Basically, there's no point sitting around waiting for it.

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 It could take all night and into the day.

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,960
 It's been that long since they were synced up.

85
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:29,680
 Obviously, it was a lot quicker when I did it, but there's no guarantee of that.

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
 Yeah.

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,720
 Would it be easier dumping the data?

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,640
 I don't think it would be any easier dumping the data.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,880
 But can you do that?

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,200
 I don't know.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
 It's not a database.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,760
 So I don't know how it works.

93
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
 Oh, no, it's a database.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
 So technically--

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,040
 Oh, sorry.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
 It's not a database that I'm familiar with.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,160
 Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,640
 It's not a SQL database.

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,560
 I can't run my SQL dump against it.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
 No, no, you can't do that.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,920
 So I think I would just stand the back up and let them sync up.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
 It's not really a database though, anyway.

103
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,760
 Sort.

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
 Well, sorry.

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
 Sorry, not by--

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
 So I will do that.

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,040
 You've got your stuff that you're doing.

108
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,240
 You're picking up stuff and sorting yourself out.

109
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 Yeah, just--

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
 Adding stuff as I go to.

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
 Keith, you're still doing the ECM stuff.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,040
 How much have you got with it?

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
 Like, how are you getting on with it?

114
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 Oh, it's going on ground.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
 I think there's much left of the initial config.

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
 Cool.

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
 Yeah, the bigger bits, the setting up, the apps in that.

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,480
 And I found out talking to the Red yesterday,

119
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,920
 apparently the code for the image core and scale that's in GitHub

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
 is not what's running in production.

121
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
 Because last time he tried to make a change,

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,240
 Craig couldn't get it to work, which was like three or four years ago.

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
 That was the Java thing that I was thinking of

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,200
 when I thought that they were trying to run

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
 AdCenter or something while Linux and got stuck.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
 I think it was--

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,480
 Red had just made a change to the image crawler or scaler,

128
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,560
 and they couldn't get it working.

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
 Yeah, but there's that there.

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
 And so, yeah, the work in there is that the stuff that's in the ECM

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,320
 and image fintech repo needs to get the same treatment

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,520
 as what I've done to web builder, stop builder, AdCenter feeds,

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,680
 and that move them to DevOps pipelines for each,

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,320
 like one for the scaler, one for the crawler,

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,760
 and then probably one for the various scripts.

136
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,520
 Or I kind of talked to Keith about this,

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 like maybe batching up related scripts,

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
 unless they're all related and watch the case,

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
 they all just get released together

140
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
 because there's not really a built process there.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
 It's just really deploying.

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,520
 And also, the assets, the JavaScript and the PHP stuff,

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,320
 so they can all be deployed by pipeline

144
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,080
 and work in a similar way to what I'm doing with the AC.com stuff.

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
 So virtual machine and basically more config,

146
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
 which Keith's sort of tying off at the moment.

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
 And then there's application config,

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
 which I'm saying with the same inverted quotes,

149
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,400
 which would be like any kind of web config,

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
 a web server config, any secrets.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,600
 And config files for the Java tasks in particular,

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,040
 that will come out of the Ansible AC.com repo,

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
 like all the other stuff is.

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
 And then the AC image feeds repo will then be like,

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,400
 that's the apps that are being deployed.

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:33,920
 So yeah, very much just try and mimic what I've started doing with AC.com anyway.

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,800
 So there is a bit of work left there.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
 Cool, should we write this down?

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
 Should I write this in this ticket?

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
 Because that was a brain that are like,

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 do you want to write it in that ticket?

162
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
 Because you just spat out a whole load of things.

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 I suppose I could do something.

164
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,080
 Yeah.

165
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
 I've talked to Keith about it, so.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
 Yeah.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,240
 Cool.

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
 Okay.

169
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,640
 Right, so I've still got that.

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,960
 So that's at least another two weeks worth of work anyway.

171
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,840
 Marcel, I tried to split up those tickets.

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,520
 So what I did was I renamed the old ticket

173
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
 to terraforming the AWS VPC.

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,200
 See this, how you already had a branch that had that code on it.

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,600
 I created another one that was basically just like a starting ticket.

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
 Yeah.

177
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,720
 For you to just capture like, so obviously VPCs, EC2s,

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 and like anything else that we need to capture.

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
 So if we just get a list in that ticket,

180
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,520
 we can close that one off and then I'll create new tickets

181
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,400
 based on the resources so that we can split the mail into tickets

182
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,320
 and create PRs for each individual bits for the AWS stuff.

183
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
 And then that means that we know exactly which bits

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
 that we've still got left to do in that

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
 and make them smaller tickets.

186
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
 Instead of just going like terraforming all of AWS.

187
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,200
 So I don't want to repeat that.

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
 Which was, yeah, yeah.

190
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,840
 So once you've tidied up the branch that you've got,

191
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,360
 we can get a PR and have a wee look through it

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,400
 and see if we want to tidy up anything before we merge it,

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
 which would be cool.

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,400
 So you've still got some stuff there.

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,480
 And Zoe, you're doing the clusters, Prisma, Cloud,

196
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
 you can't really go any further on now.

197
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
 Because emails.

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,000
 So you've been...

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
 There's some other conflict to look up.

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
 Yeah.

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,080
 I don't know, I could probably get a small ticket.

202
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
 Yeah.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
 Well, I think for the next two weeks,

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,160
 so there's obviously, I think, what there were certain...

205
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
 Because I've only got next week and then I'm on holiday for two weeks.

206
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
 Yes, so, yeah.

207
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
 Well, we can see what comes in then.

208
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,680
 What I was going to say was there's obviously these new,

209
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
 really golden signal things.

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
 Oh, yeah, okay.

211
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
 So I would just start picking these up

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
 and just see how they would apply to the,

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,080
 to, I guess, the example app.

214
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,120
 I mean, we've already got some of these things in place.

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,400
 It's just how we pull that out into a module that the devs can use

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,560
 for their apps, just to make sure that everything's monitored.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 So I guess that would be the next one.

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 And then...

219
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,640
 Okay, cool.

220
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,200
 That would sort you for a week.

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
 And then, I guess, at some point, we get to look at

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,800
 the Zero Trust in Kubernetes sort of stuff.

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,360
 Oh, yeah.

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
 But we'll have a bigger discussion about that as a group

225
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
 and just see where we think we're going with that as well.

226
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
 I don't remember that director's thing.

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,840
 Ignore that for now.

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
 I had a chat with Ross.

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
 So he didn't realize it was paid for.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,520
 So when I had a chat about that,

231
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
 he's just going to keep it in a database now.

232
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,080
 He's going to just stitch the director's stuff.

233
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
 So it's not free?

234
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
 No, no.

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
 So it's like, it was free for...

236
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,960
 It was direct us, wasn't it?

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,520
 Direct us.

238
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,680
 Because he was like,

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
 the self-hosted one's completely free.

240
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,520
 I was like, it's completely free.

241
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
 Because he hadn't clicked in this tab.

242
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 So it was completely free for up to $5 million.

243
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
 And you're like, well, we go over that.

244
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
 So we'd have to pay.

245
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,640
 So I was like, this might not actually be that expensive.

246
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
 And I was like, in the cloud version, it's like $99 a month.

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
 It's really not that bad.

248
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,040
 I was like, all you need to do is just get them to give you a price.

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 And then right up a proposal of what you're putting in it

250
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
 and how much it costs.

251
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,080
 And I'm sure somebody will say, oh, he's like, I can't even do that.

252
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,880
 I can't even do that.

253
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
 I'm like, I'm expecting it.

254
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
 I'm like, you do, you do.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
 So if he doesn't want to do it,

256
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
 and he just wants to stick it in the data, he's that same.

257
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
 And then, but yeah, we would have had to pay for it.

258
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
 And somebody would have had to sign off.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,960
 And even getting this, somebody would have had to sign off.

260
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
 And then I'm like, yeah.

261
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
 Because it had just been like, I even the data in it,

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,400
 it's like three of our names and like being able to manage,

263
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,560
 to patch management and updates and stuff

264
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
 so that they could keep track of it.

265
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
 But I mean, he can do that in a database.

266
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
 He just wanted the UI.

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
 He says, so.

268
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,200
 So that's, I don't, so I think in that case,

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
 I don't think there's really much else.

270
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
 Everybody's got stuff.

271
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,960
 Yeah, Jason, you can, you can decide with Greg,

272
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
 what Greg does when he comes back,

273
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,440
 which servers that he should pick up if he's,

274
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,320
 if he can remember what it was that you had a discussion about.

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,120
 And we'll start getting him doing some migrations,

276
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
 to go on to as well.

277
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
 If it's the Galeric clusters, then cool.

278
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
 That's probably a good one.

279
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
 He's got quite a bit of experience with that,

280
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm sure do love going back to them.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
 But it's what makes sense.

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,960
 It's what I know is how they hang together.

283
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
 Yeah, yeah, I think I probably need to be involved

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
 with some bits anyway, but.

285
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,840
 Yeah, but you do like to be involved with all of them, Jason.

286
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
 Sorry, what?

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
 I said, you do like being involved with all of them,

288
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
 and to be in the big switch.

289
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,600
 Well, no, it's just, I mean, obviously,

290
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,520
 I'm not very good at writing things down.

291
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,760
 And like just much, just recently in the last couple of weeks,

292
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
 I've been doing a lot of work that's directly related

293
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,840
 to the Galeric clusters with the character set stuff

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
 and shit like that.

295
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
 And then also remembering that I wanted to do things like TLS

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
 and that, which was tricky, which I couldn't get

297
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
 to work the first time around.

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
 So like, yeah, I want to try and set that stuff up as well.

299
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 But yeah, that's also just, it's like, particularly with things

300
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
 like the ATO proxies and the Galeric clusters.

301
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
 But yeah, could get them to do the images service,

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,400
 because really that just rails servers.

303
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,440
 Yeah.

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
 Get those done.

305
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
 Yeah.

306
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
 Possibly the big cash servers as well,

307
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
 since AC images being done.

308
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
 Can do the big cash and stuff.

309
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
 I keep all the other stuff together.

310
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,080
 Yeah.

311
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,320
 Or they could be keys next targets.

312
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
 True, true, unless he wants to break from images.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,200
 I would get to know how it all hands together

314
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
 though at the same time.

315
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:32,960
 Yeah.

316
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,560
 So two through five, I think of the images to servers.

317
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
 I think that just rails apps servers.

318
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
 So that'd be easy.

319
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,120
 That'd just be cooking kind of what I've done with AC.com.

320
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,080
 Images one, a prod images one,

321
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,120
 my real images one.

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,240
 That's like, I think they're basically just serving images.

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
 And then the Vcaches are caching images from AC image to serve up.

324
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,400
 So that'd be like three separate sort of migration jobs, I think.

325
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,920
 That's like, I don't think.

326
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,480
 Nope.

327
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 Yeah.

328
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
 So that's like, I.

329
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,840
 But yes, I do like to be involved.

330
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,640
 It's like, the only person, I mean, I'm the only person left

331
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,680
 that has enough knowledge about our Linux systems

332
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
 and where we're sort of planning to go with it.

333
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
 I will, will the bits and pieces,

334
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,480
 it's like all the historic bits and pieces that just, I, it's like,

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,200
 at all.

336
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,920
 Since JL left, I've been able to just figure out so much more of it.

337
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
 Yeah.

338
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,960
 It was quite a block working with Craig and JL on retrospect.

339
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,680
 I was not able to really learn enough because they had the

340
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,440
 rigid ways of wanting to do things which I didn't always agree with.

341
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
 And I know you've done that in them.

342
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
 Well, yeah, I mean, anyone's way of doing it, someone's going to

343
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
 disagree with for sure.

344
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,560
 And I'll disagree with my own work when I look back on it, I'm sure.

345
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,880
 There's no even at those.

346
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
 But it's also just like, you know, they've got to be interesting workers,

347
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
 well, so I never had a chance to really learn much.

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
 So since, yeah, since JL's left, it's just been like, oh cool,

349
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,960
 well, this shit's easy.

350
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
 There's nothing to worry about.

351
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
 It's all simple.

352
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,920
 Why did we make it so, why did everything have to be such a bit

353
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
 complicated mess to those guys?

354
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,400
 Yeah, I think it's the same.

355
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,120
 It's always the same.

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
 But it's like, you always worry.

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,520
 It's like, because we've had that previously, people leave you like, oh my

358
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,560
 God, how are we going to do this?

359
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
 And you're like, no, it's fine.

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
 Yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,160
 And then you learn stuff.

362
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,800
 You learn stuff.

363
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,280
 That's cool.

364
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
 And I've seen that from the outside.

365
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,120
 Whenever like Craig and JL left and go, oh my God, that's fine.

366
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,760
 We're pretty skilled people.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,200
 We're pretty good at figuring shit out.

368
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
 We'll be fine.

369
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
 Yeah, no, it was always fine.

370
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
 It's always fine.

371
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880
 We always adapt and learn and we get better for it.

372
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,520
 That's just cool.

373
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,160
 So it's all good.

374
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
 Cool.

375
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,120
 Cool.

376
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,360
 Okay.

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,600
 Right.

378
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 Go, go do things.

379
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,120
 Go be happy.

380
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
 Almost lunchtime.

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
 Get a cup of tea.

382
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,400
 That Halo Tenders bullshit should be working now.

383
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,240
 Oh yeah, I did notice that.

384
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
 I don't know what it was.

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 I haven't gone back to them all over anything, but I just closed it and put

386
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
 them out saying that it's been opened up.

387
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
 I could see in the proxy it's been on green.

388
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
 So a student's working.

389
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,960
 Anything that's not working on those servers I don't really care about.

390
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,400
 Yeah, it's like I knew this was broken and I left it because no one asked for it.

391
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
 There was a symbol.

392
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,360
 It was just because for whatever reason that's been deployed to the 10-150-233 network,

393
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,040
 which the 232 and 233 networks were open to each other previously,

394
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,560
 but a firewall has been put in front of the 232 network and we just

395
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,400
 hadn't had a request to open those particular servers up.

396
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,560
 Yep.

397
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
 Aye.

398
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,960
 So aye.

399
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
 I knew it was broken.

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
 Didn't care because Dumbledore didn't ask about it.

401
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,760
 Previously, no one had told us to open it back up.

402
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

403
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,120
 Yeah.

404
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
 I don't even know if he'd had permission to get it open back up.

405
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
 Well, technically it was never down.

406
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
 No.

407
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,560
 Yeah, it was not down.

408
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,800
 It was just that because they put this firewall in which broke everything immediately.

409
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
 And that was one of the bits where I was like,

410
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
 "Ah, tell me, you're going to do this stuff.

411
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,560
 You've just cut off like AC.com from everything."

412
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

413
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
 Oh, aye.

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,480
 That's cool.

415
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,800
 Yes.

416
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,080
 No, that's it.

417
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
 Everyone else can go.

418
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,040
 I was like, "Everyone else can go."

419
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,520
 That's fine.

420
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,920
 Yeah, no, that's sad.

421
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,120
 I don't think I'm getting a house.

422
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
 Yeah, cool.

423
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
 And yes, I will catch you all later, I guess.

424
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
 Yeah, catch you later.

425
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
 Go to it, does that?

426
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 Short and sweet.

427
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,720
 Right, go.

428
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
 Bye.

429
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,920
 Bye.

430
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
 Bye.

431
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:42,760
