| worked as a DevOps engineer, assigned the intricate task of codifying Arnold Clark's infrastructure on
AWS. This assignment was crucial, demanding careful execution to prevent jeopardizing the company's
Operations. Just a week prior to my unexpected dismissal, my manager expressed satisfaction with my
\work and awaited my code submission. However, | received an abrupt HR letter alleging poor
performance—a matter never discussed with my manager. | can corroborate this with comprehensive
digital records of all managerial interactions, made possible due to my remote work nature.

 

 

‘Suspiciously, my dismissal followed a complaint | raised about a colleague's violent behavior, endorsed
by my manager. HR was made aware but seemed unresponsive, with their demeanor suggesting they
weren't interested in a fair appraisal. Throughout, | felt dehumanized and witnessed a constructed
narrative to unjustly terminate me. | observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and my manager,
which | can substantiate. The ordeal left me mentally shattered, questioning my self-worth and life.
Notably, I'm aware of others in the company whose genuine incompetence endangered the business and
Staff, yet they remain shielded.

IN THE GLASGOW EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL

Case Number 8000485/2023

 

 

M SANGARE
Claimant
against
ARNOLD CLARK AUTOMOBILES LIMITED
Respondent
RESPONSE TO 6.1 — PAPER APART

1 THE PARTIES

1.1 The Claimant was employed by Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited. The Respondent

respectfully requests that the Tribunal amend its records to reflect the correct Respondent.

1.2 The Respondent is an automotive retailer operating more than 200 branches throughout the
UK. The Respondent employs approximately 10,000 members of staff.

1.3 The Claimant was employed by the Respondent, as a Dev Ops Engineer, from 7 December
2022 until 22 June 2023. The Claimant was based at the Respondent’s head office at
Hillington, Glasgow, with remote working from home.

1.4 The Claimant’s employment contract provided that the Claimant was entitled to one week’s
notice for each complete year of service, up to maximum of twelve weeks; and that the
Respondent reserved the right to terminate employment immediately by making a payment of
basic salary in lieu of notice.

2 PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Jurisdiction
2.1 The Claimant does not have the requisite service to bring an unfair dismissal claim in terms

of section 98 of the Employment Rights Act (‘the 1996 Act’) and any such claim that the
Claimant is attempting to advance should be dismissed entirely as a result.

ACTIVE: 116672393v2 1

45


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 4.1.respnse_to_6.1.pdf

Time Bar

2.2 The Respondent reserves its position in respect of time bar, pending receipt of further and
better particulars from the Claimant.

2.3 To the extent that any relevant acts or omissions occurred more than three months before the
presentation of the Claim Form on 25 September 2023 (subject to the extension of time as a
result of the interplay with the Early Conciliation regime from 31 July 2023 to 4 September
2023) the claims have been brought out with the time limits. Accordingly, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear such claims.

2.4 Based on the information currently available, it is denied that any allegations of discrimination
set out in the claim form part of a continuing act ending within the relevant time limit under
section 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010 (‘the 2010 Act’), or that it would be just and
equitable for the tribunal to extend time for submission of the claim under section 123(1)(b)
of the Act. It is also denied that it was not reasonably practicable for the claim to be presented
in time, in terms of the 1996 Act or that it was presented within such further period as was
reasonable in terms of the 1996 Act.

Specification

2.5 Section 8.2 of the ET1 Claim Form comprises a narration of facts and broad allegations with
many of these failing to address precisely which claims are asserted from a statutory
perspective and the underlying facts relied upon in respect of each claim. On that basis, it is
not possible for the Respondent to respond meaningfully to all of the purported claims without
further specification/clarification which we anticipate shall be required by the Tribunal at the
Preliminary Hearing.

2.6 In the meantime, the Respondent reserves its right to apply to amend its response, and to raise
any further preliminary issues as appropriate, on receipt of the necessary further
specification/clarification.

3 THE CLAIMANT’S PERFORMANCE/CAPABILITY

3.1 The Claimant’s line manager, Claire Thomson (Digital Product Development Technical
Lead), contacted the Respondent’s People Team on 12 June 2023 with concerns in relation to
the Claimant’s performance.

3.2 On 14 June 2023, Laura Cooper (People Advisor in the Respondent’s People Team) invited
the Claimant to a meeting to discuss the Claimant’s performance and continued employment.
The invite letter warned the Claimant that termination of employment was a possible outcome;
confirmed who would attend the meeting; and advised the Claimant that he could be
accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative.

ACTIVE: 116672393v2 2

46


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 4.1.respnse_to_6.1.pdf

3.3 In particular, and as the Claimant was advised, the Respondent had concerns about the
Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and to
perform the tasks expected in the Claimant’s role to the standards expected.

3.4 The Continued Employment meeting was held on 20 June 2023 and was chaired by Laura
Cooper. David Middleton (Head of Digital Talent) was present as management representative
and the Claimant chose to be unaccompanied. Due to time constraints the meeting was
adjourned and reconvened on 22 June 2023.

3.5 The Respondent’s concerns were discussed in detail with the Claimant and he was given the
opportunity to respond and put forward any mitigation.

3.6 During the adjournment, Laura Cooper discussed some of the Claimant’s allegations with
Claire Thomson. After doing so, she was satisfied that the Respondent’s concerns in relation
to the Claimant’s performance were well founded and that dismissal was the appropriate
outcome of the meeting.

3.7 The Respondent decided to terminate the Claimant’s employment, and this was confirmed to
the Claimant by letter on 22 June 2023 (the letter was dated 1 September 2023 in error). The
letter confirmed that his last date of employment was 22 June 2023 and the Claimant was
informed of his right to appeal.

3.8 The reason for the termination of employment was capability and specifically in relation to
the Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and
to performance the tasks expected in his role to the standards expected.

3.9 The Claimant did not appeal against the termination of his employment.
4 OTHER ALLEGATIONS
4.1 It is denied that the Claimant’s manager never expressed concerns with the Claimant’s

performance. While the Respondent’s performance concerns had not been addressed formally
with the Claimant until the Continued Employment process, the Claimant’s line manager had
raised concerns with the Claimant informally, including pointing out to him occasions on
which tasks had not been completed properly and corrections had to be made.

4.2 The Claimant did not raise a grievance about any of the allegations in his ET1, or otherwise.

4.3 It is denied that the Claimant formally complained about “a colleague’s violent behaviour’;
or that this was “endorsed” by his manager”; or that it had anything to do with his dismissal.
The Claimant was dismissed because of his poor performance.

4.4 It is denied that there was a “constructed narrative to unjustly terminate” the Claimant. The

Claimant was dismissed, in accordance with the Respondent’s relevant procedures, because
of capability. It is denied that there were any “racial undertones in the actions of HR and [the

ACTIVE: 116672393v2 3

47


--- New Page 4 ---
Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 4.1.respnse_to_6.1.pdf

Claimant’s manager” or that race was relevant in any way to the process followed and/or the
termination of the Claimant’s employment.

4.5 It denied that the Respondent has “shielded” “others in the company whose genuine
incompetence endangered the business and staff.”

5 UNFAIR DISMISSAL

5.1 The Claimant does not have the requisite service to bring an unfair dismissal claim in terms
of section 98 of the 1996 Act and any such claim that the Claimant is attempting to advance
should be dismissed entirely as a result. To the extent any such complaint is purportedly made
by the Claimant, this is denied and resisted by the Respondent.

5.2 It is denied that the Claimant was automatically unfairly dismissed, whether because he
allegedly made a protected disclosure or otherwise. If the Claimant is attempting to advance
such a claim it is lacking in specification and he is called upon to provide the necessary
specification at or in advance of the Preliminary Hearing.

5.3 It is denied that the Claimant was unfairly dismissed, as alleged or at all. The Claimant was
dismissed for a potentially fair reason, namely capability (or, alternatively, some other
substantial reason), as explained in section 3 above.

6 WRONGFUL DISMISSAL

6.1 It is denied that the Claimant was wrongfully dismissed by the Respondent as alleged or at
all. The Claimant’s employment was terminated in accordance with the Claimant’s
employment contract.

7 DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT

71 The Claimant has ticked the box to say he is bringing a race discrimination claim and has
referred to “harassment” as a claim, but he has provided little to no further specification of
this. Accordingly, the Respondent’s position is that when the ET1 is read as a whole it does
not contain a claim which is recognisably a claim in terms of the 2010 Act.

7.2 In any event, the Respondent denies it has breached any provisions of the 2010 Act, as alleged
or at all.

8 REMEDY

8.1 It is denied that the Claimant is entitled to any of the remedies sought within the ET1 Claim
Form.

8.2 If the Tribunal finds that any compensation is due to the Claimant, the Respondent contends

that this should be reduced to reflect:

8.2.1 Section 123 of the Employment Rights Act 1996;
8.2.2 the principles set out in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd [1987] IRLR 503;
8.2.3 the Claimant’s contribution to any dismissal found to have taken place;

8.2.4 any failure found to have occurred in respect of any applicable provisions of the
ACAS Code of Practice relating to disciplinary and grievances, namely the Claimant
did not appeal his dismissal, nor did he raise a grievance;

8.2.5 any failure by the Claimant to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses;
and/or

8.2.6 any earnings received by the Claimant subsequent to the termination of his
employment by way of alternative employment, state benefits or otherwise.

8.3 The Claimant is called upon to provide a detailed Schedule of Loss, showing the details of
any compensation sought, together with details of all income (including state benefits)
claimed and/or received, and all steps taken to mitigate his alleged losses since his
employment with the Respondent ended.

8.4 At Section 9.1 of the ET1 Claim Form, the Claimant seeks a recommendation. It is unclear
what recommendation is sought but in any event, it is denied that it would be appropriate for
the tribunal to make a recommendation given that the Claimant is no longer employed by the

Respondent.
9 GENERAL
9.1 Save as set out above no admissions are made in relation to the claim form and the grounds

of claim or remedies sought.

NOTE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY HEARING

1. The claimant was employed by the respondent as a Dev Ops Engineer from 7
December 2022 until 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from home. Following
the termination of his employment, the claimant notified ACAS of his intention
to make an application to the Employment Tribunal on 31 July 2023. The
claimant received an early conciliation certificate from ACAS on 4 September
2023 and presented an application to the Employment Tribunal on 25
September 2023 in which he claimed unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, race
discrimination and subjection to detriment and dismissal by reason of having

made a protected disclosure.

List of Issues Claimant wishes to raise

 

2. | went through the issues the claimant had raised in his ET1 and PH Agenda.
On behalf of the respondent, Mr Meechan submitted that the claimant had
raised issues in his PH Agenda and at the PH today which were not in his ET1.
Mr Meechan submitted that these additional issues would require to be the
subject of an application by the claimant to amend the ET1 and that the
respondent would be likely to oppose such an application. This was discussed
and we agreed that | would issue this Note setting out the claimant's claims as
understood following today’s discussions. Mr Meechan would then have 7 days
from his receipt of this Note within which to indicate which claims he challenged
as not foreshadowed in the ET1. Thereafter, the claimant would have 14 days
from Mr Meechan’s challenge within which to make any application to amend.
The issues raised were as follows:

Direct Discrimination

 

1. Did the respondent, because of the claimant’s race, treat the claimant less
favourably than it would have treated others? The less favourable treatment
alleged by the claimant is as follows. The claimant will say that:

a. Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer was permitted by the claimant’s line
manager Claire Thomson and second line manager, David Moffat to
behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the claimant
in the manner described below at video meetings at which they were
present and to humiliate the claimant without any steps being taken

to challenge his behaviour. By contrast, the claimant was subjected to
the respondent’s performance procedure and dismissed.

b. On or about 13 June 2023 the claimant’s line manager, Claire
Thomson misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with
the claimant that day.

c. HR did not follow the respondent’s performance procedure in relation
to the claimant;

d. The claimant sent the code he had written to David Moffat to check.
Despite being a software developer, Mr Moffat did not check the
claimant’s code.

e. The claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
meeting at which he was dismissed indicating prejudgment.

f. The claimant was dismissed on grounds of poor performance. He will
argue that, as his performance was not poor, he was dismissed
because of his race.

2. The claimant’s comparators are Jason White and other white employees of
the respondent.

Harassment

3. Did the claimant suffer unwanted conduct as follows? The claimant will say
that:

a. Over a period between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason
White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the claimant repeatedly at daily
team meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”; belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of
others. In particular, at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White
criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS which involved a
modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those
present and mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you're
doing. Let me tell you one more time..”

4. Was this related to the claimant’s race?

5. If so, did this conduct have the purpose or effect of violating his dignity,
or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive

environment for the claimant?

Indirect Discrimination

 

6. Did the respondent apply the practice of not adequately evaluating
performance in the claimant's department, so as to obtain objective

information upon which performance could be assessed with transparency ?

7. Was that practice applied to white and non-white employees in the claimant's
department?

8. Did the practice put (or would it put) non-white employees in the claimant’s
department at a particular disadvantage compared with white employees in
that the lack of transparency and objective information about performance
fostered an environment where racial prejudices may influence employment

decisions?

9. Did it put the claimant at that disadvantage?

10.If so, was the practice a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?

Victimization

11.Did the claimant do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under
section 27(2)(c) or (d) Equality Act 2010? The claimant will say that:

a. On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice.
[Claimant’s PH Agenda paragraph S.8(f).]

a. Dismissing the claimant for alleged poor performance.

Whistleblowing

13.Did the claimant make the following disclosures and if so, were they
protected disclosures as defined in sections 43B and 43C Employment
Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”)?: The claimant will say that:

a. On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. On or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of the
respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his
manager Claire Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying
passwords from the old system to the new one was contrary to the
respondent's legal obligations following a cyber security breach.

c. On or about 19 June 2023, the claimant emailed Claire Thomson,
David Moffat and the respondent’s HR department to report on-going
verbal abuse by Mr White as well as alleged IT malpractice and
breach of the respondent's legal obligations relating to data
protection.

14.Was the claimant subjected to the following detriment? The claimant will say
that:

a. Management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent's

procedures for managing performance without any proper basis for

doing so.

15.Was the claimant subjected to the above detriment contrary to section 47B

ERA because he had made one or more of the above protected disclosures?

Automatically Unfair Dismissal

 

16. The claimant does not have the necessary two years’ qualifying service to
claim ‘ordinary’ unfair dismissal. Thus, the questions is whether his dismissal

was for an inadmissible reason making it automatically unfair:

a protected disclosure contrary to section 103A ERA?

Wrongful Dismissal

18. Was the claimant’s dismissal in breach of his contract?

NOTE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY HEARING

The claimant was employed by the respondent as a ‘Dev Ops Engineer’ from 7
December 2022 until 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from home. Having
notified Acas of his intention to bring this claim on 31 July 2023 and having
received from them an early conciliation certificate on 4 September 2023, he
presented an application to the Employment Tribunal on 25 September 2023 in
which he claimed automatically unfair dismissal, race discrimination and
subjection to detriment and dismissal by reason of having made a protected
disclosure.

A case management preliminary hearing took place on 27 November 2023 at
which the issues the claimant had raised in his ET1 and PH agenda were
discussed. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Meechan submitted that the claimant
had raised issues in his PH Agenda and at the PH itself which were not in his ET1.
Mr Meechan submitted that these additional issues would require to be the subject
of an application by the claimant to amend the ET1 and that the respondent would
be likely to oppose such an application. This was discussed and it was agreed
that | would issue the PH Note recording the claimant’s claims as understood
following our discussions. Mr Meechan would then have 7 days from his receipt
of the PH Note within which to indicate which claims he challenged as not
sufficiently foreshadowed in the ET1 and thereby requiring amendment.
Thereafter, the claimant would have 14 days from Mr Meechan’s challenge within
which to make any application to amend.

. Mr Meechan sent an email to the tribunal, copied to the claimant on 8 December

2023 in which he accepted that the ET1 contained claims of whistleblowing
detriment (section 47B Employment Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”)) and automatically
unfair dismissal (section 103A ERA) and that the information recorded in the PH
Note amounted to further and better particulars of those claims. However, he
argued that the remaining claims were not grounded in the ET1 and submitted
that the claimant would require to amend to incorporate them. In correspondence
dated 22 December 2023, the claimant disputed that the claims in question were
not grounded in the ET1. He argued that they were so grounded. This PH was
fixed to (i) determine that issue; and (ii) if amendment was held to be required, to
determine the claimant’s application to amend, which he confirmed was in the

terms recorded in the PH Note of 27 November 2023 as detailed in the next two

numbered paragraphs below. The issues the claimant seeks to have determined
and the particulars the claimant seeks to add, and to which Mr Meechan objects

are as follows:

“Direct Discrimination

A. Did the respondent, because of the claimant’s race, treat the claimant less
favourably than it would have treated others? The less favourable treatment
alleged by the claimant is as follows. The claimant will say that:

a. Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer was permitted by the claimant's line

in the manner described below at video meetings at which they were
present and to humiliate the claimant without any steps being taken
to challenge his behaviour. By contrast, the claimant was subjected to
the respondent's performance procedure and dismissed.

b. On or about 13 June 2023 the claimant’s line manager, Claire
Thomson misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with
the claimant that day.

c. HR did not follow the respondent’s performance procedure in relation
to the claimant;

d. The claimant sent the code he had written to David Moffat to check.
Despite being a software developer, Mr Moffat did not check the

argue that, as his performance was not poor, he was dismissed
because of his race.

The claimant’s comparators are Jason White and other white employees of
the respondent.
Harassment

B. Did the claimant suffer unwanted conduct as follows? The claimant will say
that:

Victimization

D. Did the claimant do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under
section 27(2)(c) or (d) Equality Act 2010? The claimant will say that:

a. Onorabout 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White
had spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent,
was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice.
[Claimant’s PH Agenda paragraph S.8(f).]

Was the claimant subjected to the following detriment, and if so, was it

because he had done the protected act?

c. Dismissing the claimant for alleged poor performance.

Wrongful Dismissal

E. Was the claimant’s dismissal in breach of his contract?”

4. The following issues and particulars are not objected to by Mr Meechan and are
received as issues for determination at the hearing and as the claimant’s further
particulars of his ET1. The following amendments to the ET1 are allowed without
objection:

“Whistleblowing

F. Did the claimant make the following disclosures and if so, were they
protected disclosures as defined in sections 43B and 43C Employment
Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”)?: The claimant will say that:

was contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. Onor about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of the
respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his
manager Claire Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying
passwords from the old system to the new one was contrary to the
respondent's legal obligations following a cyber security breach.

c. On or about 19 June 2023, the claimant emailed Claire Thomson,
David Moffat and the respondent’s HR department to report on-going
verbal abuse by Mr White as well as alleged IT malpractice and
breach of the respondent’s legal obligations relating to data

Was the claimant subjected to the following detriment? The claimant will say
that:

d. Management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent’s
procedures for managing performance without any proper basis for

doing so.

Was the claimant subjected to the above detriment contrary to section 47B
ERA because he had made one or more of the above protected disclosures?

Automatically Unfair Dismissal

G. The claimant does not have the necessary two years’ qualifying service to
claim ‘ordinary’ unfair dismissal. Thus, the questions is whether his dismissal

was for an inadmissible reason making it automatically unfair:

Was the claimant dismissed for the reason or principal reason that he made
a protected disclosure contrary to section 103A ERA?”

Issue (i) - Whether the claims objected to are in the claimant’s ET1.

5. | am required to consider the claimant’s ET1 as a whole. In his ET1, the claimant
ticked the following boxes in section 8.1: ‘unfair dismissal’, ‘race discrimination’,
‘whistleblowing’ and ‘another type of claim’, which he stated was “harassment”. In
section 8.2, which asks for the details of the claim, the claimant typed two
paragraphs. After some background about the claimant’s job, the following detail
was given: “Just a week prior to my unexpected dismissal, my manager expressed
satisfaction with my work and awaited my code submission. However, | received
an abrupt HR letter alleging poor performance - a matter never discussed with my
manager. | can corroborate this with comprehensive digital records of all
managerial interactions, made possible due to my remote work nature. //
Suspiciously, my dismissal followed a complaint | raised about a colleague's
violent behaviour, endorsed by my manager. HR was made aware but seemed
unresponsive, with their demeanour suggesting they weren't interested in a fair
appraisal. Throughout, | felt dehumanised and witnessed a constructed narrative
to unjustly terminate me. | observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and
my manager, which | can substantiate. The ordeal left me mentally shattered,
questioning my self-worth and life. Notably, I'm aware of others in the company
whose genuine incompetence endangered the business and staff, yet they remain
shielded.”

6. In section 9.2, the ET1 contains the following statements so far as relevant to the
current dispute: “Compensation: “My claims to this tribunal are for the following
facts: - direct and indirect discrimination - wrongful and unfair dismissal —

organized harassment.”

7. Put shortly, Mr Meechan argues that the claims of direct and _ indirect
discrimination, harassment, victimization and wrongful dismissal set out above are
not sufficiently foreshadowed or grounded in the ET1 so as to form heads of claim.
He cites the case of Baker v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis

 

UKEAT0201/09 in support of his argument. In that case, an employment tribunal
at first instance had stated: “We reached the view that although the Claimant
ticked the box marked 'Disability' in section 6 of that claim form, nowhere in the
notes attached to the claim form (which as mentioned above, contain a list of
events in reverse chronological order) does the Claimant make a complaint which

63

10

25

30

35

Case No: : 8000485/2023 Page 8

is recognisably a complaint of disability discrimination.” At paragraph 54 of the
Judgment on appeal, the EAT held: “/n our judgment the ET correctly considered
the first ET1 as a whole. It came to a conclusion which was open to it. Whilst the
particulars given in the ET1 raised a recognisable case of race discrimination, the
Claimant did not say that the discrimination alleged had anything to do with his
learning difficulties or dyslexia. Neither did the Claimant say that any or any
specific adjustments should have been made for him by reason of his disability.
Accordingly whilst recognising that a technical approach to the question of
whether a particular claim is raised in an ET1 is inappropriate, on the facts of this
case the ET did not err in law or come to a perverse conclusion in holding that,
read as a whole, the first ET1 did not include a claim of disability discrimination.”
Mr Meechan submitted that the Baker case made clear that in order for a claim to
be in an ET1 a claimant needed to do more than tick a box. There needed to be
a nexus between the factual allegations and the protected characteristic. Applying
that to this case, Mr Meechan submitted that there was no nexus between the
claimant’s factual allegations and his race. | considered the ET1 as a whole. The
claimant has ticked the box for race discrimination. In the compensation section
he refers to “direct and indirect discrimination, wrongful and unfair dismissal and
organized harassment”. No further relevant details are given in section 9.2. In
section 8.2 where he is asked to include the details of his claim, the claimant
indicates that poor performance was suddenly alleged out of the blue by HR in
circumstances where his manager had expressed satisfaction with his work. He
states that his dismissal followed a complaint he made about a colleague’s
behaviour, of which HR was made aware but seemed unresponsive. He states
that there was “a constructed narrative to unjustly terminate me’ and continues: “/
observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and my manager which | can
substantiate.” He suggests that he was less favourably treated than others in the

company.

8. The IDS Handbook on Employment Tribunal Practice and Procedure (November
2023 Edition) states at paragraph 9.15: “Whether a formal amendment is required
will depend essentially on whether the claim form...sufficiently particularises the
essential complaint.. that the claimant ... seeks to make.” Commenting on the
Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Ali v Office of National Statistics 2005 IRLR
201 CA, the paragraph goes on “/t was necessary for claimants to set out the
specific acts complained of, as tribunals were only able to adjudicate on specific

complaints. A general description of the complaint in the ET1 will therefore not

y

suffice...” In paragraph [293.04] of Harvey on Industrial Relations and
Employment Law (Division PI Practice and Procedure; 1. Employment Tribunals;
|. The claim, its presentation to the tribunal and amendments to the claim; (2)
Presenting the claim; (b) The requirements for and importance of pleading the
claim), the learned authors say this: “A balance is to be struck. As observed by
DHCJ Michael Ford KC in the EAT in Veizi v Glasgow City Council [2022] EAT
182 (8 December 2022, unreported), the ratio of Chandhok is that the parties are
only required to set out the essence of their case in the pleadings. They do not

need to set out every fact and evidential matter in support of their case.”

9. Having considered parties’ submissions, | have come to the conclusion that the
bare bones of the claims of direct race discrimination and race related
victimisation are present in the ET1. The claimant complains about his treatment
by HR and his manager. He says that he witnessed a “constructed narrative to
unjustly terminate me”. He states: “/ observed racial undertones in the actions of
HR and my manager, which | can substantiate.” He then compares his treatment

to that of others. However, the claims require further particularisation.

10.With regard to the claim of race related harassment, the claimant refers to “a
complaint about a colleague’s violent behaviour”. When | inquired what this meant
at the PH on 27 November 2023 (standing the fact that the claimant was a remote
worker), the claimant said that he was talking about ‘verbal violence’. The
particulars of this provided by the claimant in his PH agenda and in discussion at
the PH suggested that the alleged speech complained of was rude, disrespectful,
mocking or patronising rather than violent. In any event, it is clear from the ET1
that the claimant had had issues with a colleague’s behaviour but it is not clear
that this aspect was said to be related to race. Thus, | do not find that the complaint
of race related harassment was in the ET1.

11.1 agree with Mr Meechan that the ET1 does not contain sufficient to amount to
even the essence of a claim of indirect race discrimination and that that claim as
now particularised is not discernible from the ET1. The same goes for the claim

of wrongful dismissal.

Case No: : 8000485/2023 Page 10

Issue (ii) - The claimant’s application to amend

12.The claimant confirmed that the substance of his application to amend is as
recorded in the Note of the 27 November PH and set out at paragraph 3 A to G
above. Applying the Selkent test, having regard to the interests of justice, |
considered the submissions of the parties and all the relevant circumstances of
the case. | weighed the relative injustice and hardship that would be caused to the
parties by allowing or refusing the amendment application. | have addressed the

relevant circumstances below:

The nature of the proposed amendments

13. With regard to the nature of the claimant’s proposed amendments, for the reasons
given above, | have concluded that the claims of less favourable treatment
because of race (direct race discrimination) and race related victimisation are
discernible from the ET1. Thus in relation to those claims, the amendment
provides significant further particularisation of existing claims. With regard to the
claim of race related harassment, although the word ‘harassment’ appears in the
ET1, the ET1 does not contain a discernible claim of harassment related to race
for the reasons explained above. The indirect discrimination claim is also not
discernible, nor is wrongful dismissal. Thus the nature of these latter amendments
is that they are substantial amendments which plead new heads of claim. (| would
add here that, in addition to being foreshadowed in the ET1, the race related
victimisation claim seeks to place an alternative label on some of the facts
accepted without objection in relation to the whistleblowing claim. Whilst, as Mr
Meechan submitted, those two cases may be inconsistent, it appeared to me that
they ascribe to the respondent alternative reasons for the conduct complained of
and are being put forward as alternative cases.)

The applicability of time limits

14. Although the claims identified above as being new heads of claim were set out in
the PH agenda presented on 5 November 2023, amendment was not discussed
until the PH itself on 27 November. New claims sought to be introduced by an
application to amend on 27 November 2023 would be out of time. The reason
given by the claimant for not including basic information regarding these claims in

the ET1 was that he had encountered an error message when completing online
the answer to the “other types of claim’ question at the end of the tick boxes in
section 8.1. He enclosed a screenshot stating: “Description must be 100
characters or less” and telling him he had 8 characters remaining. He said that
this error had had an impact on his approach to filling out the form in that it had
led him to adopt a more concise and focused approach to completing the form.
He said he was compelled to focus his claims to their most essential elements.
Whilst | understood that the claimant had been constrained in answering the
question about other types of claims, | did not understand him to indicate that he
had faced a similar character limit in answering question 8.2 (which asks for the
details of the claims) and he did not produce an error message for that question.
For those reasons, | did not find this explanation especially persuasive. However,
it is fair to note that the claimant is representing himself. He does not have a legal
background and this is a complex area of law. | accept that the legal issues arising
in relation to the different heads of discrimination are easier to address with the
help of the PH agenda. Treated as a discrete claim, the race related harassment
claim would have had to be notified to Acas by 18 September 2023. The wrongful
dismissal and indirect discrimination claims would have had to be notified by 21
September 2023. The application to amend was on 27 November 2023, thus it

was just over two months out of time.

The timing and manner of the application

15.With regard to the timing and manner of the application, the claimant first notified
the content of these heads of claim to the respondent in his PH agenda sent on 5
November 2023. This content was then discussed and recorded in the Note of
the PH on 27 November 2023. Although the claims were presented two months
out of time, the case was at an early stage. At the time of presenting his ET1, the
claimant did not have the benefit of legal representation or assistance. Some of
the facts put forward for the harassment claim are also pled in the whistleblowing
detriment and automatically unfair dismissal claims and are already accepted for
amendment without objection in relation to those claims. The same witnesses
would be required to talk about the same basic allegations. The specific details of
the harassment claim would be likely to be covered in the evidence of the relevant
witnesses anyway because they are the details of the complaint about a colleague
referred to by the claimant in the ET1.

16.With regard to the balance of injustice and hardship, the claimant submitted that
the prejudice to him if the amendment were refused would be massive. He would
lose the opportunity to make a claim of discrimination. Mr Meechan submitted that
the proposed amendment contained new and distinct heads of claim. If the
respondent had to answer the new claims this would involve much more work and
expense. He said the new claims would involve different evidence and different
witnesses. He pointed out that even if the amendment were refused, the claimant
would still have his whistleblowing detriment and dismissal cases and if
successful, he would be entitled to a remedy. Mr Meechan said that the indirect
discrimination claim was inconsistent with the direct discrimination claim in relation
to whether HR had followed the performance procedure. He also submitted that
the claims the claimant now sought to introduce had little reasonable prospect of
success. Mr Meechan said that with regard to the direct discrimination and
harassment claims, the claimant’s case was that the person concerned acted in
the same way to everyone. He submitted that if that was the claimant’s position,
he would be unlikely to show that he had been treated less favourably than others
because of his race. Whilst this may be so, as the higher courts continually remind
us, it is difficult and inadvisable to make try to an assessment of the facts of a

discrimination claim without hearing the evidence.

17.1 considered the interests of justice in this case and the balance of injustice and
hardship. | concluded that in relation to the claims of direct discrimination and race
related victimisation, the amendments should be allowed. | considered that these
claims were discernible from the ET1. For the reasons given above, it appeared
to me that it was just discernible from the ET1 that the claimant was claiming that
he had been treated less favourably and that his race was a reason for that. |
accept, as Mr Meechan submitted that this would sound in expense and extra
work for the respondent. However, it appeared to me that the witnesses the
respondent would require to call and the facts alleged for these claims and also
for the harassment claim were similar to those of the whistleblowing detriment and
automatically unfair dismissal claims. With regard to the victimization claim, this
is really an alternative label for some of the facts of the whistleblowing claim (as
Mr Meechan pointed out). Thus, on balance, | concluded that the amendments in
respect of the claims of direct race discrimination, race related harassment and
race related victimisation should be allowed. In my view the relevant evidence

would require to be led at the hearing anyway. The balance of injustice and

68

5

hardship favours the claimant in relation to these claims. It would be a greater
hardship for him to be denied the opportunity to have potentially valid claims heard
than it would be for the respondent to defend them.

18.However, | concluded that the balance of injustice and hardship favoured refusing
the application to amend in respect of the remaining claims of indirect
discrimination and wrongful dismissal. These claims, although mentioned in the
ET1 were not foreshadowed in it to the extent required. The indirect discrimination
claim would require new evidence to be gathered which would not otherwise be
required. The claimant will have the opportunity to have his other discrimination
claims heard. The wrongful dismissal claim is not particularised to any extent and
the respondent doe not have fair notice of the particulars of this claim.
Furthermore, as Mr Meechan points out, since a contract can be terminated at
common law by means of the notice clause, contractual notice is normally the
extent of the measure of loss in such a claim. If either of the claimant’s claims of
automatically unfair or race related dismissal were to succeed, the notice period
would be covered by the corresponding remedy for loss in any event.

19.The case will now proceed to the full hearing on 25 April 2024. Orders for
preparation for that hearing have already been issued.

IN THE GLASGOW EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL

Case Number 8000485/2023

 

 

M SANGARE
Claimant
against

ARNOLD CLARK AUTOMOBILES LIMITED

Respondent
RESPONSE TO 6.1 — PAPER APART (AMENDED MARCH 2024)
1 THE PARTIES

1.1 The Claimant was employed by Amold Clark Automobiles Limited.

1.2 The Respondent is an automotive retailer operating more than 200 branches throughout the
UK. The Respondent employs approximately 10,000 members of staff.

1.3 The Claimant was employed by the Respondent, as a Dev Ops Engineer, from 7 December

2022 until 22 June 2023. The Claimant was based at the Respondent’s head office at
Hillington, Glasgow, with remote working from home.

1.4 The Claimant’s employment contract provided that the Claimant was entitled to one week’s
notice for each complete year of service, up to maximum of twelve weeks; and that the
Respondent reserved the right to terminate employment immediately by making a payment of
basic salary in lieu of notice.

2 PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Time Bar
2.1 The Respondent reserves its position in respect of time bar.
2.2 To the extent that any relevant acts or omissions occurred more than three months before the

presentation of the Claim Form on 25 September 2023 (subject to the extension of time as a
result of the interplay with the Early Conciliation regime from 31 July 2023 to 4 September

2023) the claims have been brought out with the time limits. Accordingly, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear such claims.

2.3 Based on the information currently available, it is denied that any allegations of discrimination
set out in the claim form part of a continuing act ending within the relevant time limit under
section 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010 (‘the 2010 Act’), or that it would be just and
equitable for the tribunal to extend time for submission of the claim under section 123(1)(b)

of the Act.
3 THE CLAIMANT’S PERFORMANCE/CAPABILITY
3.1 The Claimant’s line manager, Claire Thomson (Digital Product Development Technical

Lead), contacted the Respondent’s People Team on 12 June 2023 with concerns in relation to
the Claimant’s performance.

3.2 On 14 June 2023, Laura Cooper (People Advisor in the Respondent’s People Team) invited
the Claimant to a meeting to discuss the Claimant’s performance and continued employment.
The invite letter warned the Claimant that termination of employment was a possible outcome;
confirmed who would attend the meeting; and advised the Claimant that he could be
accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative.

3.3 In particular, and as the Claimant was advised, the Respondent had concerns about the
Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and to
perform the tasks expected in the Claimant’s role to the standards expected.

3.4 The Continued Employment meeting was held on 20 June 2023 and was chaired by Laura
Cooper. David Middleton (Head of Digital Talent) was present as management representative
and the Claimant chose to be unaccompanied. Due to time constraints the meeting was
adjourned and reconvened on 22 June 2023.

3.5 The Respondent’s concerns were discussed in detail with the Claimant and he was given the
opportunity to respond and put forward any mitigation.

3.6 During the adjournment, Laura Cooper discussed some of the Claimant’s allegations with
Claire Thomson. After doing so, she was satisfied that the Respondent’s concerns in relation
to the Claimant’s performance were well founded and that dismissal was the appropriate
outcome of the meeting.

3.7 The Respondent decided to terminate the Claimant’s employment, and this was confirmed to
the Claimant by letter on 22 June 2023 (the letter was dated 1 September 2023 in error). The
letter confirmed that his last date of employment was 22 June 2023 and the Claimant was
informed of his right to appeal.

3.8 The reason for the termination of employment was capability and specifically in relation to

the Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and
to performance the tasks expected in his role to the standards expected.

71

Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

3.9 The Claimant did not appeal against the termination of his employment.
4 OTHER ALLEGATIONS

4.1 It is denied that the Claimant’s manager never expressed concerns with the Claimant’s
performance. While the Respondent’s performance concerns had not been addressed formally
with the Claimant until the Continued Employment process, the Claimant’s line manager had
raised concerns with the Claimant informally, including pointing out to him occasions on
which tasks had not been completed properly and corrections had to be made.

4.2 The Claimant did not raise a grievance about any of the allegations in his ET1, or otherwise.

43 It is denied that the Claimant formally complained about “a colleague’s violent behaviour’;
or that this was “endorsed” by his manager’; or that it had anything to do with his dismissal.
The Claimant was dismissed because of his poor performance.

4.4 It is denied that there was a “constructed narrative to unjustly terminate” the Claimant. The
Claimant was dismissed, in accordance with the Respondent’s relevant procedures, because
of capability. It is denied that there were any “racial undertones in the actions of HR and [the
Claimant’s manager” or that race was relevant in any way to the process followed and/or the
termination of the Claimant’s employment.

4.5 It denied that the Respondent has “shielded” “others in the company whose genuine
incompetence endangered the business and staff.”

5 AUTOMATICALLY UNFAIR DISMISSAL

5.1 It is denied that the Claimant was automatically unfairly dismissed because he allegedly made
a protected disclosure.

5.2 The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as explained in section 3 above.

6 WHISTLEBLOWING DETRIMENT

6.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to a detriment contrary to section 47B of the
Employment Rights Act 1996 because he made one or more protected disclosures, as alleged
or at all.

6.2 In particular,

6.2.1 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the
claimant told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had
spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to
insecurity in the department and was having an effect on his own health and safety
and on that of the whole team". The claimant did say that he was not comfortable
with the way Jason White had spoken to him, and that he found it condescending,

ACTIVE: 118707365v1 3

72


--- New Page 4 ---
Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

but he did not mention anything about it being “insulting, abusive and violent” or
having any impact on “health and safety”.

6.2.2 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of
the respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his manager Claire
Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying passwords from the old system
to the new one was contrary to the respondent’s legal obligations following a cyber
security breach”. The claimant did raise an issue with the practice of copying
passwords, but he did not say to Claire Thomson that he considered this to be in
breach of any legal obligation and the process and reason for it was explained to him
by Claire Thomson.

6.2.3 It is accepted that the Claimant emailed Claire Thomson, David Moffat and the
Respondent’s HR department on 19 June 2023, in which he complained about how
Mr White had spoken to him. However, it is denied that this amounted to a protected
disclosure. It is also denied that the Claimant made allegations of “IT malpractice
and breach of the respondent’s legal obligations relating to data protection” in this
email. It is accepted that the Claimant made suggestions about how the Respondent
could improve its coding practices and IT “hygiene”, but the email did not allege
any breach of legal obligations in this regard, whether related to data protection or
otherwise.

6.2.4 It is denied that the disclosures referred to in paragraphs 6.2.1 to 6.2.3 above
occurred as alleged by the Claimant and furthermore on either the Claimant or
Respondent’s version of the alleged ‘disclosures’, the relevant ‘disclosures’ were
not protected disclosures for the purposes of the Employment Rights Act 1996.

6.3 It is denied that “management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent’s procedures for managing
performance without any proper basis for doing so.” The Claimant’s dismissal was not
predetermined and the decision to dismiss was made in accordance with the Respondent’s
usual practice in the circumstances, including inviting the Claimant to a ‘continued
employment’ meeting to discuss the Respondent’s concerns before making its decision.

6.4 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was subjected to the above alleged detriment, which is
denied, it is denied that this was because he made a protected disclosure.

7 DIRECT RACE DISCRIMINATION

7.1 It is denied that the Respondent treated the Claimant less favourably that it would have treated
others, because of race, as alleged or at all.

7.2 In particular:
7.2.1 It is denied that Claire Thomson (the Claimant’s line manager) and David Moffat

(the Claimant’s second line manager) permitted Jason White (Dev Ops Engineer) to

ACTIVE: 118707365v1 4

73


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the Claimant during video
meetings at which they were present and to humiliate the Claimant without
challenging Jason White’s behaviour. It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed
because of performance and Jason White was not, under explanation that this was
because the Respondent did not have the same concerns about Jason White’s
performance as it did with the Claimant.

7.2.2 It is denied that, on or about 13 June 2023, Claire Thomson misrepresented to HR
what had happened at a meeting with the Claimant that day.

7.2.3 The Claimant says the Respondent did not follow its performance procedure in
relation to the Claimant. The Respondent does not operate a standalone performance
procedure but follows its disciplinary procedure in circumstances where there are
concerns about performance. As set out in the disciplinary procedure, the procedure
will not normally apply in the case of employees with less than 24 months’ service.
In those circumstances, the Respondent’s practice is to hold a ‘continued
employment’ meeting with the employee at which the concerns are discussed, and
the employee is given an opportunity to respond to those concerns before any
decision is made. This is what happened in the Claimant’s case.

7.2.4 It is accepted that the Claimant sent code in an email which was copied to David
Moffat on 19 June 2023 and that David Moffat did not check the code. However, it
is denied that the code was sent to David Moffat “to check.” It was included in an
email sent to Laura Cooper and David Middleton, as the people who would be
involved in the Claimant’s continued employment meeting the next day, raising a
number of different points and issues. David Moffat was not due to attend that
meeting and did not consider he was expected to check the code. In any event, David
Moffat’s not checking the code was not because of race.

7.2.5 It is denied that the Claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
continued employment meeting. It is explained that when an employee is dismissed
by the Respondent, AXA benefits are cancelled following dismissal but to take
effect from the day before the last day of employment.

7.2.6 It is denied that the Claimant was dismissed because of his race. The Claimant was
dismissed because of capability, as explained at section 3 above.

7.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was treated less favourably, as alleged above, it is
denied that this was because of race.

7.4 It is denied that the Claimant’s comparators, namely “Jason White and other white employees
of the Respondent” are appropriate comparators. An appropriate comparator is someone in
relation to whom there is no material difference between the circumstances (except for the
existence of the protected characteristic).

Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

8 RACE RELATED HARASSMENT

8.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to harassment related to race, as alleged or at all,
in terms of section 26 of the 2010 Ac.

8.2 It is denied that the Claimant suffered unwanted conduct, as alleged, namely: “Over a period
between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the
Claimant repeatedly at daily meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”, belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of others. In particular,
at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS
which involved a modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those present and
mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you’re doing. Let me tell you one more
time.”

8.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did suffer the alleged unwanted conduct, it is denied
that it was related to race; and/or that it had the purpose or effect of violating the Claimant’s
dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
for the Claimant, and/or that it was reasonable for the Claimant to regard it as having that

effect.
9 VICTIMISATION
9.1 It is denied that the Respondent has subjected the Claimant to a detriment because he did a

protected act, in terms of section 27 of the 2010 Act.

9.2 It is denied that on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the Claimant told
his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had spoken to him at the
meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to insecurity in the department
and was having an effect on his own health and safety and that of the whole team.” In any
event, it is denied that this is capable of amounting to a protected act in terms of section 27 of
the 2010 Act.

9.3 It is denied that the Claimant submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice. It is accepted that this will
amount to a protected act if the Tribunals finds this did happen (which is denied).

9.4 It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed but it is denied that this was because he did a
protected act, as alleged or at all. The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as
explained at section 3 above.

10 REMEDY

10.1 It is denied that the Claimant is entitled to any of the remedies sought within the ET1 Claim
Form.

75

Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 6.response_to_6.1_amnedment_march.pdf

10.2 If the Tribunal finds that any compensation is due to the Claimant, the Respondent contends
that this should be reduced to reflect:

10.2.1 Section 123 of the Employment Rights Act 1996;
10.2.2 the principles set out in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd [1987] IRLR 503;
10.2.3. the Claimant’s contribution to any dismissal found to have taken place;

10.2.4 any failure found to have occurred in respect of any applicable provisions of the
ACAS Code of Practice relating to disciplinary and grievances, namely the Claimant
did not appeal his dismissal, nor did he raise a grievance;

10.2.5 any failure by the Claimant to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses;
and/or

10.2.6 any earnings received by the Claimant subsequent to the termination of his
employment by way of alternative employment, state benefits or otherwise.

10.3 The Claimant is called upon to provide a detailed Schedule of Loss, showing the details of
any compensation sought, together with details of all income (including state benefits)
claimed and/or received, and all steps taken to mitigate his alleged losses since his
employment with the Respondent ended.

10.4 At Section 9.1 of the ET1 Claim Form, the Claimant seeks a recommendation. It is unclear
what recommendation is sought but in any event, it is denied that it would be appropriate for
the tribunal to make a recommendation given that the Claimant is no longer employed by the

Respondent.
11 GENERAL
11.1 Save as set out above no admissions are made in relation to the claim form and the grounds

of claim or remedies sought.

This contract of employment is between the following two parties.

EMPLOYER: ARNOLD CLARK AUTOMOBILES LIMITED, Incorporated under the Companies
Act with the number SC36386 and having its registered office at 454 Hillington Road,
Glasgow G52 4FH (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Company’ and/or ‘Arnold Clark’) and

appropriate pay period. However, the Company will not be liable for bank or other
charges incurred by you due to a delay in payment of salary to your account. You are
advised to bear this in mind when arranging standing order and Direct Debit payments.

You should check your payslip upon receipt and contact the Wages department
immediately if you think that a mistake has been made.

Any wage or salary alterations, permanent or temporary, are shown on the payslip,
which you should retain as a reference document.

Hours

Your working hours are set out in your offer letter. However, your working hours may
vary to include any additiona! hours as necessary for the proper performance of your
role, depending on departmental or local requirements.

You must keep to the times set and made known to you for starting and finishing work.
Your departmental manager will specify your rest intervals and again, these must be
strictly observed. Any rota arrangements which are currently in practice may be altered
from time to time to meet the demands of the business.

Periodically, you may be required to work additional hours to those specified to meet the
requirements of the Company. Usually this will be to cover peak trading periods, the
absence of other staff and in order to ensure proper performance of your duties. The
payment of overtime (if applicable) is dealt with in your offer letter.

Working Time Regulations

The Working Time Regulations 1998 (‘WTR’) state that an employer is required to take
all reasonable steps to ensure that employees do not work more than an average of 48
hours a week over a 17-week period.

You agree that the 48-hour weekly limit under WTR will not apply to you during your
employment with the company unless you give three months’ notice in writing to the
Company to the contrary.

Deductions

The Company reserves the right in its absolute discretion to deduct from your salary
and/or any other sums owed to you, any money which you may owe the Company.

You therefore hereby authorise the Company at any time during your employment and
upon its termination (howsoever arising) to deduct from your remuneration (which, for
this purpose, includes but is not limited to your salary, pay in lieu of notice, commission,
bonus, holiday pay and sick pay) and/or any other sums due to you, any sums owed by
you to the Company including (but not limited to) any overpayments or loans or

advances (together with interest where appropriate) advanced by the Company to you,
reimbursement of parking or traffic offence penalties, insurance excesses, fuel misuse
charges, customer short payments, any notice payments which correspond to any period
not worked by you without the agreement of the Company, or losses suffered by the
Company as a result of your negligence, breach of authority or duty, or breach of any
rules or policies relating to your employment.

Holidays

Full-time staff
Holiday year: 1st January to 31st December

Your annual holiday entitlement depends on the number of complete years of continuous
service you have with the Company, as set out in the table below.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Years of complete continuous service Days of Annua! Leave Entitlement (Per
Holiday Year)

Less than 3 33

You will be entitled, without loss of remuneration, to the holiday entitlement set out
above which, for the avoidance of doubt, is inclusive of the usual public holidays in
England and Wales (‘Statutory Holidays’).

Statutory Holidays may be taken from commencement of employment. However, it is a
condition of employment that you be prepared to work Statutory Holidays if required to
meet the demands of the business. If you are required to work on a Statutory Holiday,
you will receive an alternative day off in lieu during the current holiday year.

During any holiday year, annual leave must be taken at the appropriate rate for each
month worked during that holiday year, which (in respect of Non-Statutory Holidays) will
accrue on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the table outlined above). During any
continuous period of sickness absence of one month or more, you shall only accrue
statutory holiday under Regulation 13 of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (‘WTR’)
and not any additional contractual holiday entitlement. The Company reserves the right
to require you to take your holidays on particular dates and/or refuse a holiday request
having regard to the reasonable requirements of the business. The Company shall give
you reasonable notice of any such requirement.

If your employment commences part way through the holiday year, your holiday

entitlement during the first year of your employment shall be calculated on a pro-rata
basis, rounded up to the nearest whole day.

When employment terminates part way through the holiday year, any holiday pay in
respect of holidays accrued in the current holiday year will be paid in lieu on a pro-rata

basis, except where your employment is terminated for any reason justifying summary
termination or where you terminate your employment without notice. In either case,
such accrued but untaken holiday shall be based on your minimum holiday entitlement
under the WTR only. On termination of employment, any excess holiday pay received by
you over that which you have accrued, will be repayable to the Company by deduction
from final pay, where possible. By accepting employment with the Company, you hereby
authorise such a deduction to be made.

Annual holiday leave must be taken during the appropriate holiday year at a time agreed
with your departmental manager and normally no more than two weeks consecutively.
Annual holiday leave cannot be carried over to the next holiday year.

You must give reasonable notice of dates that you wish to take as holidays. If you do not
give sufficient notice, you may not be given permission to take those dates as a holiday.
If either party has served notice to terminate employment, the Company may require
you to take any accrued but unused holiday entitlement during the notice period.

No payment will be made in lieu of holidays, except on termination, as described above.
Any paid holiday that has been taken by you shall be deemed first to be European leave
under the Working Time Directive and Regulation 13 of the WTR, then additional annual
leave under Regulation 13A of the WTR, and, then only when this is exhausted, to be
any additional contractual paid holiday.

[Product Consultants should refer to Sales Office for further information about holiday
entitlement. ]

Part-time staff

Part-time staff are entitled to the holidays described above on a pro-rata basis by
reference to the full-time entitlement.

Notice

During the probationary period, the amount of notice to be given and received by both
parties shall be not less than one week. After successful completion of the probationary
period or any extension of it, you will be required to give the Company one month’s
written notice and you shall be entitled to receive one week’s notice for each full year of
continuous service up to a maximum of 12 weeks (after 12 years’ continuous service or
more). The Company reserves the right to terminate employment immediately without
notice (or payment in lieu of notice) in cases of gross misconduct, or if you commit a
serious breach of obligations as an employee. The Company also reserves the right to
terminate your employment with immediate effect by letting you know it is exercising its
right to do so under this contract and that it will pay you in lieu of the basic salary you
would have received had you worked your notice period (or any remaining part of it).

Furlough Leave

In the event that the Company is required to close its premises or if there is a reduced
need for you to perform your role on a temporary basis due to the impact of a national
or local health crisis, or the imposition of any directions, measures or legal requirements
by the government or local authority, or any other circumstances outwith the Company’s

control, the Company shall be entitled to place you on a period of leave (‘Furlough
Leave’). Any such period of Furlough Leave shall be for as long as the Company
determines is necessary.

You shall be given as much notice as is reasonably practicable if you are to be placed on
Furlough Leave.

During any period of Furlough Leave:
e you shall not be required to work, or your hours of work may be reduced as the
Company determines is necessary; and
e the Company will confirm to you as soon as reasonably practicable what your pay
arrangements shall be during any period of Furlough Leave which may be
required.

A period of Furlough Leave, including your entitlement to pay, may be subject to the
terms of any government scheme, direction, regulations or legislation in place from time
to time and the Company reserves the right to impose any conditions which may be
required in order to comply with these.

Nothing in this clause shall impact your statutory rights, including in relation to family or
sickness leave and pay.

Other employment

commencement of your position with Arnold Clark, this should be disclosed to the People
Team as soon as possible and consent to this obtained if Arnold Clark considers this

take on additional paid employment, you must seek prior consent from the People Team.

Interest in business other than that of the Company

You will not be concerned or interested either directly or indirectly, whether financially or
otherwise, in any business which is or could be in competition with that of the Company,
without the prior written consent of the Company, except as a non-executive
shareholder or debenture holder, with a limit of 5% of issued capital.

Sickness benefit

If you are absent from work for any reason you must inform your line manager by 10
a.m. on your first day of absence.

In the case of absence due to sickness for up to seven calendar days, a Self-Certification
Form must be completed on ACE as soon as you return to work and submitted to your
line manager. If you remain absent from work, you must produce a medical certificate to
cover the entire period while you are absent. The medical certificate must state the
reason for the absence. If you do not follow these requirements, you may be subject to
disciplinary action in terms of the Company’s disciplinary policy.

If you are absent from work for more than three days by reason of sickness or injury
and you satisfy the sickness absence reporting procedure, you will be entitled to

For the avoidance of doubt, Company Sickness Benefit will not be paid to an employee
who is absent from work at any point during a disciplinary procedure (including any
investigation prior to a disciplinary hearing being scheduled) or to any employee who
has progressed to the second stage of disciplinary action (e.g. from a verbal warning to
a written warning or from a written warning to a final written warning). In disciplinary
cases, the employee will be notified that their entittement to Company Sickness Benefit
will be suspended for the lifetime of the disciplinary warning. Any suspension or
withdrawal of Company Sickness Benefit will be subject to review in accordance with
advice from Occupational Health and the final decision regarding suspension or
withdrawal of Company Sickness Benefit will be at the discretion of the Directors.

Subject to the Directors’ discretion outlined above (and compliance with the sickness
absence reporting procedure), basic salary, inclusive of any SSP entitlement,
(‘Company Sickness Benefit’) may be payable to salaried employees for the following
periods:

 

Years of complete continuous service | Amount of entitlement during any
rolling 12-month period

 

 

 

 

 

Less than 3 3 months
3-4 3 months
5-9 3 months
10 -14 4 months
15 and over 6 months

 

In respect of hourly paid employees, no Company Sickness Benefit will be payable for
the first three days of absence from work on normal working days in any period of
sickness. Full basic pay, inclusive of SSP entitlement, may be payable from the fourth
working day in line with and subject to the terms and conditions set out above.

As set out above, subject to the Directors’ discretion, entitlement to Company Sickness
Benefit (if applicable) will be based on a rolling 12-month period.

Company Sickness Benefit (if applicable) will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for part-
time employees by reference to full-time equivalent entitlement.

The Company reserves the right to require you to undergo a medical examination
conducted by a doctor nominated by the Company, at the Company's expense. You
agree that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be

Disciplinary procedure

This policy does not form part of the employee’s contract of employment and may be
amended by the company from time to time.

Introduction

In Arnold Clark it is essential to maintain standards of performance to assist in the smooth
running of the business. This procedure is designed to help and encourage you to achieve
and maintain standards of conduct, job performance and attendance. Its aim is also to
ensure consistent and fair treatment of all employees.

Informal procedure

Minor shortcomings in meeting the requirements of your job may be brought to your
attention informally by the person to whom you are primarily responsible or by the People
Team If, however, formal steps are necessary, the following will apply.

Guidelines for the conduct of formal disciplinary meetings

Disciplinary action will normally be taken by the People Team but circumstances may
warrant someone else being involved.

No disciplinary sanction will be imposed until the situation has been investigated.

You will be advised in writing of the nature of the complaint against you and we will aim to
give you a minimum of 48 hours’ notice before any disciplinary meeting takes place. You will
be given the opportunity to comment before any decision is made at a disciplinary hearing.
Your comments will be taken into consideration in making that decision.

You may be accompanied by a work colleague or an official of a trade union during any
disciplinary meeting or appeal. The person accompanying you may not answer questions on
your behalf and his or her name should be disclosed before any meeting.

Disciplinary action may be started or taken at any level of this procedure if a particular
complaint warrants such action.

Although time limits on warnings are contained in the procedure, there may be instances
when it is necessary to extend them. In such circumstances an explanation of why this has
been done will be given. You will not be dismissed for a first breach of discipline, except

in the case of gross misconduct, when the penalty will be immediate dismissal without
payment for the period of your notice.

You may appeal against any disciplinary decision following the procedures set out below in
paragraph 6.

Implementation of the disciplinary policy

In certain circumstances an investigation may take time to complete. For this and other
reasons, the company may suspend you on full pay until the disciplinary procedure has been
completed. During any period of suspension, you will not be entitled to enter the company’s
premises except at the company’s prior request.

A disciplinary will be arranged between you and the person to whom you report or a
member of the People Team. You will be advised of the name(s) of the person(s) who will be
conducting the meeting.

The persons conducting the interview will decide what Cif any) disciplinary measures to apply
while considering the circumstances and your previous record.

If improvement is required in your conduct, performance or attendance as part of this
procedure, you will be informed of this fact in writing, as well as the period during which it will
be monitored and the consequences of failing to carry it out satisfactorily. It is important that
you participate in this process, so that any additional training or support can be discussed.
The position will normally be reviewed with immediate effect and you will be advised of the
timescale for improvement in writing.

If the disciplinary action results in your dismissal with notice, the company will decide
whether you should be paid in lieu of that notice period or whether you will be required to
work your notice.

Disciplinary sanctions
The following disciplinary sanctions may be imposed:
Verbal warning

Minor disciplinary matters will normally be dealt with by a formal verbal warning. You will be
advised of the reason for the warning, that it is the first stage of the disciplinary procedure
and of your right of appeal. A note of that warning will be placed on your personnel file and
will normally be disregarded after six months, provided that during that time there is no re-
occurrence of the unsatisfactory performance, conduct or attendance.

Written warning

If the nature of the misconduct is considered too serious for a verbal warning or if a further
episode of unsatisfactory performance, conduct or attendance occurs during the lifetime of
a verbal warning, a written warning will normally be issued. Once again you will be advised
of the reason for the warning, the stage of the disciplinary procedure that has been reached,
what you should do to improve, the timescale for improvement, the consequences should
you not improve and of your right of appeal. A copy of the warning will be placed and kept
on your personnel file, and will normally be disregarded after 12 months, provided that during
that time there is no re-occurrence of the unsatisfactory performance, attendance

or misconduct.

Final written warning

If there is still a failure to improve and your conduct, performance or attendance is still
unsatisfactory, or if there is an offence which is sufficiently serious a final written warning
will normally be issued. This warning will be dealt with in the same way as a written warning
except that it will also warn you that dismissal or other sanction may result if no satisfactory
improvement is reached. It will normally be disregarded after a period of 18 months.

Dismissal or demotion

If there is still no satisfactory improvement regarding job performance or attendance, or if
there is a further occurrence of misconduct during the lifetime of a final written warning, you
will normally be dismissed with notice. The decision to dismiss will be given to you in writing
and the letter will set out the reason for dismissal, the date on which your employment will
terminate and your right of appeal. Pending the outcome of any such appeal, your dismissal
will stand.

In some circumstances, as an alternative to dismissal the company may decide to impose
a demotion along with a final written warning, this decision would also be given to you in
writing and you would have the right to appeal. Pending the outcome of any such appeal,
your demotion and final written warning will stand.

Company sick pay during a disciplinary process

For details on payment of sick pay during a disciplinary process or while a disciplinary
warning is live, please refer to the Contract of Employment.

Summary dismissal

You will normally be dismissed with immediate effect and without notice or payment in lieu
of notice in cases of gross misconduct. The procedure will be as set out above. You will be
required to leave the company’s premises immediately. Examples of gross misconduct are
as follows:

Theft, fraud, physical violence, bullying, deliberate and serious damage to property, serious
misuse of company property or company name, deliberately accessing pornographic internet
sites, serious insubordination, unlawful discrimination or harassment, bringing the

organisation into serious disrepute, consumption of drugs or alcohol at work or being under
the influence of either, causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence, serious
breach of health and safety rules, serious breach of trust and confidence, misuse of the
automated first registration and licensing system or data associated with the service. This
list is not exhaustive and other actions may be considered to be gross misconduct.

While gross misconduct will usually relate to the company’s business, circumstances may
also occur when conduct, which is not so related, will be treated as gross misconduct
because of your position or duties, the need to maintain mutual trust and confidence or
the need to protect the company’s reputation. For example, you should be aware that the
company will take a serious view if you are convicted of a criminal offence other than a
minor motoring offence not involving a custodial sentence.

Appeals

If you consider that you have a case to appeal any disciplinary decision taken you should
follow the company appeal procedure. The details of where to send your appeal will be
notified to you when you are informed of the disciplinary decision.

Written notice of any appeal should be addressed to the person hearing your appeal and
should be made normally within five working days of your being notified of the disciplinary
decision. You must at that stage specify the grounds of the appeal. A meeting will then be
arranged as soon as is reasonably practicable.

An appeal may result in the removal of the disciplinary sanction, a lesser sanction or the
confirmation of the original sanction. If the decision is to revoke a dismissal, you will be
reinstated with back pay. There is no further right of appeal, the decision of the person
hearing the appeal will be final and confirmed in writing.

Dismissal for employees with less than 24 months’ service

In the case of employees with less than 24 months’ service, the above procedure will not
normally apply. Please contact the People Team in the first instance for further information.

2.1.

Grievance procedure

This policy does not form part of the employee’s contract of employment and may be
amended by the company from time to time.

1. Introduction

As a company, we seek to communicate with employees and to foster an open culture
wherein employees can raise any issues or concerns. The purpose of this policy is to set out
how employees can go about raising and resolving any issues that they may have.

The procedure applies to all employees, irrespective of their length of service, hours worked
and seniority. Anyone wishing to use the procedure can do so freely and without prejudice
to their position within the company.

All employees should be aware that malicious or reckless abuse of the grievance procedure
to raise unfounded complaints or allegations will be viewed very seriously by the company
and may lead to disciplinary action (including summary dismissal) being taken against the

employee responsible.

2. Informal procedure

Any employee who has a workplace issue should, in the first instance, make their line
manager aware of the problem and seek to rectify it in an informal manner before the formal
procedure is invoked.

As part of the informal process, consideration will be given to mediation in the first instance.

Mediation

The purpose of mediation is to seek a mutually agreeable solution to resolve an issue at work
without the need to progress to the formal grievance procedure. Mediation may be suitable
in instances where communications and relationships have broken down. It can re-establish
communication lines and individuals can agree ways to work together constructively. In
order for mediation to be a success, it must be willingly entered into by both parties looking
for a solution and not to apportion blame.

If a resolution is not achieved through informal means, including mediation, the individual
who raised the grievance may wish to progress to the formal process.
3. Formal procedure

We recognise that from time to time there will be issues that need to be raised in a formal
manner, having exhausted the informal process. All grievances raised under this policy will
be treated with complete confidentiality.

Step 1: Firstly, the employee should set out the grievance in writing and send it to the
People Team. A meeting with the employee will then be arranged to discuss the
issue. This will usually take place within a reasonable time of receipt of
the grievance.

An investigation will be undertaken to establish the full facts and circumstances of
the case. A decision will subsequently be made and communicated to the employee
in writing as soon as possible.

Step 2: If the employee feels that the grievance has been unsatisfactorily resolved after they
have been notified of the outcome, they can appeal against the decision.

The grievance decision letter will set out who the employee should write to if they
wish to appeal the decision. The identity of the person who will hear that appeal will
be notified to the employee when they are informed of the grievance decision.

This appeal must be in writing and should set out the basis of the appeal. The
employee should appeal within five working days of notification of the decision.

A meeting with the employee will then be arranged to discuss the appeal. The grounds of
appeal will be investigated and the decision will then be communicated to the employee
in writing as soon as possible. The decision will be final and binding and there is no further
right of appeal.

The employee has the right to be accompanied at all meetings by a work colleague or an
accredited trade union representative.
4. Complaints of discrimination and harassment

In the event of a complaint of discrimination or harassment, a grievance should be raised
in accordance with the procedure above. Further information on this can be found in the
Company Harassment Policy.

Bullying and harassment policy

This policy does not form part of the employee’s contract of employment
and may be amended by the company from time to time.

. Our policy

Every employee should be treated with dignity and respect at work. Arnold
Clark is an equal opportunities employer that fully adheres to the Equality
Act 2010. The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination
in the workplace and in wider society.

It is against the law to discriminate against anyone based on the following
nine protected characteristics:

e Age e Race

¢ Gender reassignment e Religion

e Marriage or civil partnership e Sex

e Pregnancy ¢ Sexual orientation
e Disability

Arnold Clark is committed to maintaining a working environment that is free
from harassment, victimisation and bullying, whether it is related to sexual
orientation, race, religion, gender reassignment, gender identity, religion,
disability, age, pregnancy and any other factor that is unlawful.

Harassment at work in any form is unacceptable behaviour and we have a

zero tolerance approach in ensuring that harassment will not be permitted
or condoned. The policy applies not only in the workplace but also outside
it where there is an occasion that is directly connected with an individual’s
employment; for example at an office party or on a business trip.

Employees have the right to complain of harassment and all complaints will
be dealt with seriously, promptly, with confidentiality and in accordance
with the company’s grievance policy.

All employees have a role to play by assisting the company in complying
with this policy. They can help prevent harassment through an awareness of
and sensitivity towards such issues and by ensuring that their conduct and
that of their colleagues does not cause offence.

Title of ebook of origin: 10.bullying_and_harassment_policy.pdf

Employees at all levels should be aware of their responsibilities in
ensuring that such harassment is not a feature of our workplace. It is a
form of misconduct that can undermine the integrity of the employment
relationship. Harassment on the grounds of sex, race, religion, disability,
age, gender identity or sexual orientation constitutes discrimination and is
unlawful, as per the Equality Act 2010. Harassment may also be a

civil offence and a criminal offence and it may contravene health and
safety legislation.

The company will take appropriate disciplinary action against any employee
who does not comply with this policy, which may include dismissal. An
employee who retaliates against another employee who has complained
about harassment or any employee who intentionally makes a false claim of
harassment may have disciplinary action taken against them.

This policy prohibits all forms of harassment whether amounting to
unlawful conduct or not. It intends to prevent all forms of offensive and
unfair behaviour.

.What constitutes harassment?

Harassment is unwanted or offensive conduct that affects the dignity of
employees at work. It may be related to age, sex, race, disability, religion,
nationality, gender identity (please see glossary of terms for a more in-
depth list of terms related to gender identity), or any personal characteristic
of the individual, and may be a persistent or an isolated incident or occur on
a number of occasions. Such behaviour can create an intimidating, hostile
or humiliating working environment and affect an employee’s performance.

e Unwanted physical contact such as unnecessary touching, patting,
pinching or brushing up against another employee's body, insulting or
abusive behaviour or gestures, physical threats or assault.

¢ Unwanted comments of a sexual, racial or religious nature or which relate
to an individual’s age, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation.

¢ Unwanted non-verbal behaviour of a sexual, racial, homophobic, biphobic
or transphobic nature.

¢ Unwanted comments relating to disability and/or jokes concerning
disability, as well as mimicking disabled people.

¢ Overbearing supervision or other misuse of Power or position.

e¢ Bullying including persistent criticism and personal abuse, either in public
or private, which humiliates or demeans the individual involved.

e Exclusion or victimisation: Deliberately withholding information or
scheduling meetings without that person present.

e Exclusion or victimisation on the grounds of transphobia: For example,
excluding a trans person from meetings by deliberately scheduling them
at times when they know the individual is on leave to attend a gender
clinic appointment.

e¢ Forcing a non-binary individual to wear either ‘male or female’ clothing
while at work.

96


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 10.bullying_and_harassment_policy.pdf

e Misgendering individuals by deliberately using incorrect pronouns Cie.
Calling someone ‘he’ when they identify as a woman.)

e Making inappropriate jokes or gestures about an individual based on their
sexual orientation or gender identity.

Harrassment can also be on a much smaller scale than the examples listed
above. For example, it could be an individual experiencing a change in
behaviour from a fellow employee after disclosing that they are bisexual
or gay.

The essential characteristic of harrassment is that is unwanted. It is for
individuals to determine what behaviour is acceptable to them and what
they regard as offensive.

It is important to remember that behaviour that is acceptable to one
employee may not be acceptable to another. It is the impact of the
behaviour that is relevant and not the nature or intent behind it.

Harassment is not always carried out face-to-face, it may take the form of
written communications, emails or over the telephone.

. Prevention

Arnold Clark recognises that it is the duty of all employees to accept their
personal responsibility for fostering a fully integrated community at work,
by adhering to the principles of equal opportunity. All our managers and
employees are required by the company to ensure that no discriminatory
practices occur and we will strive to ensure that this is the case. All staff are
required to:

e Make sure that they treat everyone fairly and without bias.

e Not harass, victimise or bully any employee or client.

e Recognise, accept and value people’s differences and abilities.
e Not stereotype or generalise people or groups of people.

e Listen and respect everyone’s views regardless of their background,
gender, beliefs or experience.

e Draw any discriminatory act or practices to the attention of managers.

¢ Carry out duties at all times with due regard to the company’s equal
opportunities policy.

Each employee has a personal responsibility for the practical application
of this policy and to ensure that Arnold Clark achieves its equality
objectives. The successful implementation of this policy depends on
everyone treating each other with the respect and dignity they would
rightly expect from others.

Managers and supervisors have particular responsibility for the practical
application of this policy and for ensuring a harmonious working
environment. They will be responsible for addressing and eliminating any
situation involving bullying, harassment or any other forms of discrimination.
Arnold Clark undertakes to provide the necessary support and training,
which will include awareness of discrimination legislation and its impact on
decisions they make.

4.Procedure

4.1. Informal

Most recipients of harassment simply want it to stop. Employees may
therefore want to resolve the problem informally, if this is possible. In some
cases it may be sufficient for the employee to explain clearly, verbally

or in writing, to the person engaging in the unwanted conduct that

their behaviour is not welcome and should stop. However, the company
recognises that there will be circumstances when it may be embarrassing
for an employee to do this or if the behaviour continues after they have
asked for it to stop. In such a situation, the employee is encouraged to
approach their line manager or the People Team for advice and assistance.
They can then assist the employee in attempting to resolve the problem
informally by approaching, on the employee’s behalf, the person engaging
in the unwanted conduct. Alternatively, they can discuss with the employee
the possibility of a complaint through formal channels.

4.2. Formal

If it is not appropriate to deal with the problem by informal means, the
employee can choose to raise their complaint through the company’s
formal grievance procedure by making a formal complaint to their line
manager or to the People Team. The complaint must be made in writing.
Please see the company’s grievance policy for further details.

5. Formal investigation

All allegations of harassment will be taken seriously and will be dealt with
as quickly as possible, with due regard to confidentiality and in accordance
with the company’s grievance policy. The People Team will ensure that the
complaint is carefully investigated, that it is sensitively handled and that
the rights of all involved are respected. In certain circumstances, it may be
appropriate to require any person involved to take paid leave of absence
until the process has been completed. That will not be an indication that
any views have been formed about the complaint.

The employee making the complaint will be interviewed to establish

the full details of the complaint. The employee will have the right to be
accompanied at all meetings by a work colleague or an accredited trade
union representative. The alleged harasser will also be interviewed and
normally this will be done separately.

The person investigating the complaint will not be connected with the
allegation and will ensure that an independent and objective assessment

is made and that the wishes of the complainant are considered. The
complainant will then be informed of the outcome of the investigation. The
complainant will have the right to appeal the decision if they disagree with
the outcome.

98


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 10.bullying_and_harassment_policy.pdf

As a result of such an investigation, a disciplinary meeting may be called
under our disciplinary procedures. The same person who conducted the
investigation would not usually conduct the disciplinary meeting unless we
consider this appropriate. The outcome of that process will be confidential.

In the event that any employee makes an unfounded allegation of
harassment for malicious reasons, such cases will be dealt with under the
disciplinary procedure.

6. Counselling

Counselling services are available to all employees through our healthcare
provider that offers a confidential service staffed by professionals. Please
contact the People Team on 0141 648 1390 for further information.

Equal opportunities policy

This policy does not form part of the employee’s contract of employment
and may be amended by the company from time to time.

. Our policy

Equality Act 2010

Arnold Clark is an equal opportunities employer that fully adheres to the
Equality Act 2010. The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from
discrimination in the workplace and in wider society.

It is against the law to discriminate against anyone based on the following
nine protected characteristics:

e Age e Race

¢ Gender reassignment e Religion

e Marriage or civil partnership e Sex

e Pregnancy ¢ Sexual orientation
e Disability

Arnold Clark takes a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of unlawful and
unfair discrimination in relation to any of the protected characteristics listed
under the Equality Act 2010 with the inclusion of gender identity (please
see glossary of terms to ensure awareness of definitions).

Arnold Clark’s policy is to recruit, retain, develop, reward and promote
people based on objective criteria, without regard to ethnic origins, race,
nationality, colour, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation,
disability, religion and beliefs or age, or any other unlawful criteria unless
this is justifiable regarding relevant aptitudes, potential, skills and abilities.

It is Arnold Clark’s legal responsibility to ensure that no applicant or
employee shall be placed at an unlawful disadvantage by requirements

or conditions which are not necessary to the performance of the job. As
such, Arnold Clark will make provisions to ensure that there are no barriers
that prevent any person protected by the Equality Act 2010 from applying
for and being successful in applying for employment by the company. We
simply want the best person for the job and a genuinely diverse workforce.

2.

3.1.

It is important to us that the workforce of the business is as representative
as possible of the community it serves. Arnold Clark is committed to the
promotion of equal opportunities and to ensure that the talent and skills of
all employees are maximised. Arnold Clark’s policy is to treat all employees
with respect and dignity and to ensure that decisions are taken without
reference to irrelevant or discriminatory criteria.

What constitutes discrimination?

e Inappropriate comments, behaviours or stereotyping individuals either

directly or by association based on race, sexual orientation, gender
identity, disability, and any other protected characteristic.

e Excluding people from elements of employment, either directly or by

association due to race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,
disability, and any other protected characteristic.

e Expressing negative stereotypes about particular groups or using

stereotypes as a basis for decisions about work e.g. ‘Women with young
children shouldn’t work’ or ‘older workers can’t learn new skills.’

e Assuming that because a person is married that it is to the opposite

sex (e.g. always referring to a woman’s partner as a man when they are
married to a woman).

It is important to recognise that this list is not exhaustive and that the main
characteristic of harassment that stems from discrimination is that it is
unwanted. It is for individuals to determine what behaviour is acceptable to
them and what is acceptable to one employee, may not be to another. It is
therefore the impact of this behaviour that is relevant and not the nature
or intent behind it. Further information on this can be found in the
Harassment Policy.

.Employee lifecycle

Arnold Clark ensures that the principles of the Equality Act 2010 are
followed at every stage of the employee lifecycle; from seeing a job
advertisement to settling in and interacting with customers and clients.

Recruitment process

Job advertisements (both internal and external) will be non-discriminatory.
Job advertisements are written and reviewed by a team of experienced
copywriters who monitor that specific standards are adhered to and that
the language used could not be perceived to be discriminatory against any
particular group. Following this, all those involved in assessing candidates
for Cinternal and external recruitment or promotion) will be trained in non-
discriminatory recruitment and selection techniques.

3.2. In the workplace

Arnold Clark recognises that it is the duty of all employees to accept their
personal responsibility for fostering a fully integrated community at work,

Each employee has personal responsibility for the practical application
of this policy and to ensure that Arnold Clark achieves its equality
objectives. The successful implementation of this policy depends on
everyone treating each other with the respect and dignity they would
rightly expect from others.

Managers and supervisors have particular responsibility for the practical

environment. They will be responsible for addressing and eliminating any
situation involving bullying, harassment or any other forms of direct and/or
indirect discrimination. Arnold Clark undertakes to provide the necessary
support and training, which will include awareness of discrimination
legislation and its impact on decisions they make.

3.3. Dealing with customers, clients and service users

Arnold Clark seeks to ensure that all employees enjoy coming to work and
are not subject to discrimination or harassment from customers, clients or
service users. We have a legal obligation to ensure that no person faces
discrimination on the grounds of any protected characteristics, inclusive of
gender identity, when accessing our services, either as an employee, client
or customer.

Should you experience or witness any discriminatory act or practices then
this should be reported to a member of management or the People Team.

4.Responsibility

Arnold Clark can only act to prevent individuals from breaking this policy
if it knows about the conduct. If you have a concern about an equal
opportunities issue or if you believe that you have experienced direct,
indirect or unfair discrimination, harassment or victimisation, you should
speak to your manager informally. If the matter cannot be resolved
informally, you should use the company’s grievance procedure or

speak to the People Team. All complaints will be dealt with seriously,
properly and confidentially and every effort will be made to secure a
satisfactory resolution.

Behaviour of a discriminatory nature will not be tolerated within Arnold
Clark and may be considered to be gross misconduct. Where appropriate,
the company will take disciplinary action against any employee who
breaches this company policy, or is found guilty of victimising, bullying or
harassing another employee, or is otherwise found guilty of conduct in
contravention of the anti-discrimination laws.

Inclusive language

Using language that is as inclusive as possible is a key part of creating
a welcoming environment where everyone feels included. Language
is always shifting; it varies across cultures and people hold different
opinions so there isn’t a universal consensus. These recommendations
are provided only as guidelines and aren’t meant to censor opinions;
instead, we want to improve communication. This document isn’t
definitive; the most important thing is to consider the impact of your
language and be willing to learn and change.

General principles

1. Don’t mention a person’s gender, ethnicity etc. unless it is relevant.

2. Be gender neutral whenever you aren’t speaking about a specific
individual. Use they/them instead of she/her or he/him.

3. Be inclusive of non-binary identities by using phrases like ‘regardless
of gender’, ‘all genders’ or ‘different gender’ rather than ‘men and
women,’ ‘both genders’ or ‘opposite gender’.

4. Use person-first language. For example, people with disabilities as
opposed to disabled people or the disabled.

5. Avoid phrases that suggest victimhood when speaking about
disability, e.g., ‘afflicted by’, ‘victim of’, or ‘suffers from’. Instead, say
‘person with [condition]’.

6. Avoid euphemisms for disability like ‘differently abled’ or
‘special needs’.

7. Don’t use phrases or terms that make light of disabilities like ‘blind/
deaf to [something]’, ‘lame’, or ‘crazy’. Mental health diagnoses like
bipolar or OCD are conditions with serious impacts so don’t use them
to describe everyday behaviours.

8. Avoid using language that promotes damaging stereotypes, for
example saying ‘man up’ or referring to a woman as emotional.

9. When talking about an individual, use the language they use to refer
to themself.

10. If you aren’t sure, look it up or ask.

Glossary

Ableism: Practices and dominant attitudes in society that assume there is
an ideal body and mind that is better than all others.

Cisgender: People whose gender identity matches the gender they were
assigned at birth. Used as a counterpart to transgender: people whose
gender identity does not match the gender they were assigned at birth.

Heteronormativity: A default assumption of heterosexuality and
stereotypical gender norms.

Intersectionality: The interconnected nature of social categorisations
such as race, disability, and gender that can create overlapping and
interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.

Invisible (or hidden) disability: A disability that is not externally
apparent, such as a mental illness, chronic fatigue syndrome or diabetes.

Neurodiversity: The idea that neurological differences like autism and
ADHD should be recognised and respected as any other human variation.

Non-binary: Any gender identity that does not fit the male and
female binary.

Privilege: A right or advantage that only some people have access or
availability to because of their social group membership.

Reclaimed language/words: Words with a history of derogatory use that
members of the oppressed group have decided to use for themselves.
Sometimes these types of words are still controversial within the
community, like queer, and sometimes it is acceptable for members of
the group to use a word but not those outside it, so care should be taken
when using them.

4.1 Commitment to Cyber Security

Arnold Clark Cyber Security team is led by the Head of Cyber Security reporting to the Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO). The Chief Information Security Officer is fully supported by the
Arnold Clark Board of Directors, who in turn advocate that all employees have a responsibility to protect
the company’s assets and information.

The cyber security requirements are aligned to the strategic objectives of Arnold Clark Group and the
risk management framework. Arnold Clark adopts a ‘Three Lines of Defence’ model to ensure that risks
and controls are properly managed by its businesses, functions and digital teams on an ongoing basis.

All Employees

The Arnold Clark Cyber Security team are responsible for leading the risk assessment with all relevant
stakeholders involved to identify, quantify and manage risks within their areas of responsibility whilst
achieving business objectives.

All risks identified must be captured in the Arnold Clark Digital Risk Register with an action plan in place
detailing how the risk will be managed in line with the risk rating, who will be responsible for ensuring
the mitigating controls are implemented and the date for completion. All risks are subject to continuous
review, aligned with our Risk Management Framework.

Risk assessments are performed periodically on a variety of assets within the organisation to address
changes in Arnold Clarks risk appetite or when significant changes occur. These assets may be physical
assets, people, processes, software and information to assess all aspects of risks, threats and
vulnerabilities.

The risks identified must be captured in the AC Digital Risk Register. Actions taken to mitigate the risks
must be captured and reported on a periodic basis.

The Arnold Clark Cyber Security team must lead the risk assessment and involve all business managers
to identify and manage risks within their areas of responsibility.

4.1.1 Risk Assessment Methodology

Security risks must be assessed using the cyber risk management framework. The assessment must
include the potential business impact of the risk in terms of compromise of the information asset. The
assessment must also include the likelihood of the impact occurring. The two factors must contribute to
the overall risk score.

Based on the risk score, appropriate risk treatment methods must be deployed to reduce the impact of
the risk. The following risk treatment methods may be used:

e Transfer — this method involves transferring the risk to a third party to help reduce the impact
of the risk.

e Accept - it may be that the cost or impact of implementing a control to mitigate a given risk
exceeds the benefits the control has on the risk, in which case, the management may decide to
accept the risk as-is.

e Reduce - this method involves implementing controls to mitigate the risk, thereby reducing
both the impact and likelihood of exploitation.

e Avoid - this method involves avoiding / stopping the business process to eliminate the risk
from occurring.

4.2 Roles and Responsibilities

All Arnold Clark Group - employees, contractors and third party users must report security risks and
incidents to the Service Desk and / or to their line managers. The individual(s) responsible /
accountable for managing the risk may not be from the same business unit.

The Arnold Clark Cyber Security team will coordinate with the individual(s) providing assistance where
required.

Appendix

The Cyber Essentials scheme is a UK government-backed certification scheme that helps organizations of all sizes
protect themselves against common online threats. It provides a set of basic cybersecurity controls that
organizations can implement to reduce their risk of cyber attacks.

Under the UK GDPR, individuals have a number of rights with respect to their personal data, including the right to
be informed about how their data is being used, the right to access their data, the right to have their data corrected,
the right to have their data deleted, and the right to object to the processing of their data in certain circumstances.

Organizations that process personal data are required to comply with a number of principles, including the
principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability. They must also implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data and report data breaches to the appropriate
authorities.

The PCI-DSS is a set of security standards established by the major credit card companies to protect against credit
card fraud and data breaches. It applies to all organizations that process, store or transmit cardholder data. The
standard outlines a set of requirements for securing cardholder data and ensuring that it is processed and stored in
a secure manner.

The PCI Security Standards Council, which oversees the development and maintenance of the PCI-DSS, regularly
updates the standard to address new threats and vulnerabilities. However, the core principles and requirements of
the standard remain largely unchanged from version to version. It is important for organizations to stay up to date
with the latest version of the standard and implement any necessary changes to their security practices to ensure
compliance.

Sorry Claire, but with the details you gave me during the discussion, i understand that my colleague
(Jason) might be facing some difficult circumstances that are therefore valid .

{12/01/2023 17:13] Marcel Sangare

Soi think i will just do like you and try not to pay too much attention to some bits and pieces that are
not done with a bad intention

[12/01/2023 17:13] Marcel Sangare

So let's just forget about that discussion we had this afternoon...as i was not aware of these
challenges.

(12/01/2023 17:15] Marcel Sangare

I think it is better to try to support him rather and i willjoin you in that regard.

Dear Mory-Marcel
ARNOLD CLARK PENSION PLAN

We're pleased to confirm that you were enrolled into your company pension
plan on 27 April 2023.

The Government requires all employers to enrol their employees into a
pension to encourage them to save towards their future.

Legal & General is the company selected by your employer to provide your
~~ plar-and-to make-sure-you have all the-help-and information you need every” ~~

step of the way.

For more information on how we use your data please read the Legal &
General Privacy Policy at legalandgeneral.com/privacy-policy. For
information on how the Mastertrust Trustees use your data (in their capacity
as a separate data controller) please read their Privacy Policy at
legalandgeneral.com/mastertrust-privacy-policy. Please give us a call if
you would like to request paper copies of these policies.

What being in the plan means for you

- Joining the plan means you're saving towards your future. Your employer will
be making monthly contributions to your pension pot on your behalf.

If your employer is paying your contributions by salary sacrifice, then you're
giving up part of your salary in return for a regular contribution from your
employer. This means your contribution is taken from your pay before tax, so
you benefit from tax relief straight away, and you save on National Insurance
too. Any contribution made, including your own, paid by salary sacrifice, is
counted as an employer contribution and will be included in the figure below.

Percentage of your pensionable
earnings

Money going in

Your employer's contribution 9%

ou may have agreed an alternative amount with your employer. They'll tell
you how they work out your pensionable earnings.

Hey folks, off a call with Dave K.

We have made the decision to Under 23 month dismiss Marcel - he's not worked out and we
have no room for passengers right now.

David Middleton: Are you good to start the conversation with the People team?
Claire : DK asking if we need to replace but we can think about that and come back to him.
Cheers

[25/05/2023 10:50] David Middleton

Hi, | see Claire is off today but before | talk to people team does marcel know from explicit
conversations there is an issue with his work because that will be their first question
[25/05/2023 10:52] Claire Thomson

Hiya, just saw this
[25/05/2023 10:58] Claire Thomson

I've had chats with him to commit his work various times, That what he's attempted to do wasn't
in line with what we were trying to do, so | tried to be more explicit in what | was asking. | guess
it's more of an overall thing. I've had occasions where Zoe has discussed how to structure the
terraform but then he asks me after it, He seemed to take it personally when Jason said that we
shouldn't be writing bash in ansible - that we should be using ansible modules for example...
Marcels reaction was to say there was a module for bash - but that doesn't mean it's right - it's
not what we should be doing - use the tools the way they are intended

[25/05/2023 10:59] Claire Thomson

| guess it's everything as a whole - with so much experience | don't think we should need to
guide him so much

[25/05/2023 11:00] Claire Thomson

| don't know exactly what | should have said to say there was an issue, | couldn't go no that's
totally wrong, it's been trying to course correct | guess

[25/05/2023 11:02] David Middleton
Thanks Claire, from an HR perspective we haven't had an explicit 1-2-1 that he isn’t meeting

expectations was what | was meaning. | thought that was the case but want to just be sure of my

facts is all
[25/05/2023 11:03] Claire Thomson

No I've not had an explicit 1-2-1 in that regard

Back to bed and get better Claire- can talk more on Tuesday on this. Can wait till then.
[25/05/2023 11:10] Claire Thomson

[Tuesday 11:55] Claire Thomson

remember to push your changes to your branch

[Tuesday 11:56] Claire Thomson
I'm gonna stick a recurring meeting in your calendar for the end of the days hahaha (I won't

really )

[Tuesday 11:58] Marcel Sangare

(will push Claire ...i was intending to do so by the end of the day..i am just testign a few bits and
pieces before doing so...but i will...

like 7

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have
an idea before i push this afternoon.

130


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 15.exchanges_claire_moffat_others_about_me.pdf

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them
down , each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them
into a single folder as requested by you last week:

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

Selection 418.png

[Tuesday 14:13] Marcel Sangare
The reason why | initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are

considered isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for
scalability and strict isolation from each other.

[Tuesday 14:15] Claire Thomson
so there should only be one variables file and one outputs file - these are going to be the same

inputs and outputs across all VPCs - this is why pushing to git helps - then! can pull the branch
and look at the code and discuss it rather than looking at some file names on a screenshot

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed...it will be as you mentioned below:

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc- 1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

so there will be a single main.tf, a single variables.tf and a single output.tf

131

Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 15.exchanges_claire_moffat_others_about_me.pdf

[Tuesday 14:21] Marcel Sangare

But in order to make this easier, iam breaking the individual configs along these lines before
merging into a single folder

[Tuesday 14:23] Claire Thomson

most of the variables will be in your files to start with anyway as it's not a module so it's defined in
the code

[Tuesday 14:26] Claire Thomson

we don't need things isolated, | get the original idea - but we want to be able to run a pipeline
across them all - check for changes etc - no manual running of anything

[Tuesday 14:27] Claire Thomson

terraform has -target to allow you to specify which parts of state you want to change/destroy if we
need to

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

yes i understood the idea you had in mind when mentionign this.

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

{ pushed just now the changed on three vpc so that you can see

[Tuesday 14:29] Marcel Sangare

it is on branch INFRA-675/AWS, for vpc-010c0d84db3 1a1d1b, vpc-0232b16b, vpc-439e2c26

Thanks Claire, sorry i didn;t know you weren't well. I'm all good here
[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

and this was from the Friday.

[Friday 09:29] Claire Thomson

Please remember to push your local commits to git it's good practice to push at a minimum
at the end of the day, if you were off sick for example someone could pick up where you left off

[Friday 11:07] Marcel Sangare
Good morning Claire.Sorry you are absolutely right.It is just me and my silly habit of pushing only
what appears to be the best...bad habits die hard but something i do need to rectify indeed. i was

trying t make the comments as consistent as possible. | am just finishing the vpc_accounting script
that will be pushed today as well

[Friday 11:09] Marcel Sangare
so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS'", under "aws", there will be a folder

"vpc terraform version 1.3.7" with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version
7.3.7.

[Friday 11:33] Claire Thomson

why? this should all be in one folder, it's all still in separate folders?

It should be along these lines as discussed

AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Friday 11:35] Claire Thomson

it should be "= 1.3.7"

[Friday 11:44] Claire Thomson

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right

[Friday 11:45] Claire Thomson
push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that

just say "Typo"

[Friday 11:45] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed.So i first rewrote all the individual terraform configs using 1.3.7, tested them thoroughly .

Thanks! makes it so much easier to read, then we should be pretty close to that PR and getting
VPCs out the way and on to the next resource

[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

no worries

[25/05/2023 11:15] Claire Thomson

As | said it's more of an overall thing, for his experience, we expected more - sorta what |
mentioned to you already. it's like he's at a junior level, and | get not understanding Ansible or
Terraform, and things taking a bit longer - but everything seems to be so long and just the
though process around things seems odd, even just the basics like pushing to git...

[25/05/2023 11:16] Claire Thomson

the whole thing makes me feel bad - he's such a nice guy and the start he had was terrible with
the incident but where do you stop - | don't think | could trust him to do BAU.

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson

maybe that's what | need to do - | don't know how long we have - but put him on BAU only for a
couple of weeks and prove he can't even do the basics

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson
take ansible/terraform out the equation
[25/05/2023 11:19] David Moffat

I'm looking back at his CV - he's not showing us any of the things he listed under his skills

Marcel Sangare - CV 1.pdf

 

[25/05/2023 11:19] Claire Thomson

| now feel even sicker than | did It's not nice, | want people to do well and it feels like a
failure on me that I've not assisted him enough

[25/05/2023 11:20] David Middleton
It's cool don't be stressing claire! | will talk to people team and you can focus on getting better

We've seen nothing from him in "DevOps" - given experience / salary it's not been good enough.

feel bad Claire - sometimes it just doesn't work out, we're not going to get 100% success rate

Marcel was hired as a replacement headcount for an experienced engineer in the team. The
roles and responsibilities of the role he applied for made clear he would “Utilize
infrastructure-as-code to deliver automated, predictable and scalable solutions,
infrastructure and services” and “Evangelise automated, fault-tolerant and secure
developments and practices”. Of the work Marcel has produced to date we don’t believe he
has the competencies to complete these two responsibilities in particular.

Marcel continues to struggle with distributed version control systems. The team has
provided multiple repeated explanations in 1-2-1 sessions and in written Teams chats on
how these systems should be used to enable the team to collaborate. Our using of version
control systems is the standard industry way of working namely to work in a feature branch
and commit small changes continually. It is critical for everyone in the team to work in the
same way especially when we the team works in a hybrid of office and home working. After
multiple reminders most days Marcel is still not able to follow this process and rather sends
screenshots and emails which slows down and distracts the Team Lead and the other
members of the team.

As explained at interview the focus of the ArchOps team where Marcel applied and
currently sits is to support the delivery of our strategic objective to move our software
deployment infrastructure architecture to that known as “Infrastructure as Code”. The tools
we use to deliver this are Terraform and Ansible. Both tools are industry standard tools for
this work and Marcel stated on his cv and at interview that he had experience with. Marcels
performance to date indicates that his competencies with these tools are at best limited and
not up to the requirements for the role he was hired to undertake. Tasks which take other
members of the team days to complete are taking Marcel weeks which is well below the
performance level expected of someone with his stated experience. Of particular concern is
Marcel’s inability to not use raw scripts but create reusable modules to complete work. This
is a fundamental principal of the strategy we as a department are looking to follow and is
having a significant negative impact on the team’s ability to operate and the work that
Marcel is producing.

Given the above we believe there isn’t a role for Marcel in the department given the natural
way Marcel likes to work and his level of exposure to the tools we use. Marcel was brought
in as an experienced senior engineer and as such we would expect him to take autonomous
ownership of some of the tasks of the team. Given our time with Marcel to date we don’t
believe that is going to be possible.

Current Task - Identify all AWS resources and add to source control.
The task originally was to identify all AWS resources and add them to our source control
system. Marcel was instructed to work from a branch in a designated repo, look at our

existing structure, create a new AWS folder and add the code to it.

The first concern in this task arose when Marcels first attempt at lead him to try and script
the creation of the terraform.

139


--- New Page 4 ---
Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 16.communication_between_hr_and_claire.pdf

Terraform is a tool to create Infrastructure as Code. The end goal of this task — all our tasks,
is to use the tools to automate the creation of the infrastructure.

Marcel was course corrected to make sure he understood that his thinking was incorrect, he
reasoned that if someone was to spin up new resources we could run the script to capture it
in terraform — | corrected that by reinforcing that no one should be clicking the buttons to
create the resources manually — that they will be created in the code, approved and ran via
a pipeline.

Realising that the task needed to be more focused it was then broken down further to focus
solely on VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud)

Marcel tried to create the VPCs but created each part of them individually, reasoning that it
would allow us to manage each bit separately. | had to correct his course again — | explained
that a VPC consisted of multiple parts that were linked and should exist and be managed
within the same file — as we could not possibly recreate a VPC without destroying all the
resources that existed within this. | highlighted this by showing Marcel the Resource Map
that exists in AWS.

Marcel has had ample time to review our repos and look at the AWS interface and with his
experience realise how infrastructure has dependencies on each other.

Macel had another attempt to restructure his work and then paired with his colleague Zoe
to review it. Zoe highlighted issues with the structure, the version being used and how the
state file worked (that we did not want them individual)
Following that Marcel then called me, questioning what Zoe had said. | reiterated that she
was correct — and this is what t had previously explained that we wanted a single VPC folder
with them all in it.

Having explained on calls and in the chat the folder structure that was expected, what parts
of the code had to go where, screen sharing and dragging and dropping files as an example
to show this had now turned in to a drag and drop exercise to refactor what was there, | was
still met with having to go over it yet again on our catchup — that the settings were to
remain in the file and not in the variables file.

Marcel did say that he’d misinterpreted a previous comment in the chat (19 folder
structure) but it had been followed with the example on the call, and the comments in the
chat on the (23)

Throughout this as previously mentioned, I’ve had to remind him to push changes to github,
not to send screen shots when asking me to assist, these are just the reminders in chat,
others were issued verbally.

Commits were infrequent and often one or two lines or words were changed in a period of a

few days — this work rate is below what | would expect, even from a graduate or
apprentice.

140


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 16.communication_between_hr_and_claire.pdf

If | had given this task to anyone else on the team it would have been completed within a
few weeks.

This is in addition to a previous attempt at a task which had similar course corrections and
misunderstanding of the tool and how it should be used (ansible), that while it can runa
bash script — that we should use the collections and roles designed for it and only use
custom scripts where absolutely necessary.

| feel that at this point I’d have no confidence that Marcel could perform a task that came in
on our BAU board without a lot of support and guidance.

Good Afternoon.

| would like to firstly introduce myself. My name is Mory-Marcel Sangare, and | work as a DevOps engineer. My
direct manager is Claire Thomson and the head of our department is Mr David Moffat.

| would like to also tell you who are the persons in copy of this email and they are:

Mr. David Moffat, who is the head of my department

Mrs. Claire Thomson, who is my direct manager

Mrs. Laura Cooper from the Human Resources department
Mr. David Middleton from the Human Resources department.

With your permissions, | would like to express myself in writing regarding the letter | received from Mrs Laura
Cooper by email on Wednesday, June 14th at 5:17 PM, which | only became aware of in the afternoon of
Thursday, June 15th, 2023.

This fetter i must say came as a shock to me because nothing was preparing me for this. It is to summarize
informing me that i am failing at my current role and is emphasizing the fact that my contract might get
terminated tomorrow.So you will understand therefore my surprise and the reason of the following paragraphs.

The letter is emphasizing the fact that my understanding of our systems and of my job is not right and that we
will tomorrow be discussing the continuation of my employment at Amold Clark.

Please allow me to say that absolutely nothing was preparing me for this because at no time since i started was
i briefed by my direct manager of problems with the quality of the work i have been producing to date.

Since i joined, i worked mostly on 2 tasks:

- rebuilding an sftp server used by extemal partners of Amold Clark.The ftp server in question is used to
exchange important information back and forth and was meant for rebuilding because it was running an
operating system that is now ageing and also in light of our move towards the ubuntu operating system for all
our servers

- writing the terraform configuration for all the assets our company Amold Clark has on the AWS Cloud and the
initial task was to write these configurations for all our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in all regions worldwide.

Now i am forced to give you some more details below so that you can understand the later part of this email and
my message will be broken in parts:

1/ My first task: rebuilding an sftp server used by internal and extemal partners of Arnodl Clark

2/ Writing the terraform configuration for all the assets of Arnold Clark on AWS Cloud.
3/ The interaction to date with my drect manager

4f My first task: rebuilding an sftp server used by internal and external parners of Amold Clark

So regarding the first task, the aim was to rebuild the server with the ubuntu operating system and thereafter
cteate the accoumts for the extemal and intemal users.Among these users, some were using passwords to
authenticate and some others would resort to ssh keys for authentication. So in fight of that i wrote 2 scripts
perfectly functional in January 2023 that can be found below for these of you with access to the company
github.For those without, i attached to the present email a pdf print of the program source code (related attached
file: pushing script for sftp users setup with passwords) so that it could be reviewed if necessary by any other
party:

 
       

SOCOM ee Oe

The request for this to be merged into our main repository for use was done on the 22 of February 2023.

So as i was made aware that generating ssh keys was proving difficult for some users (they did not want to do it
or did not know how to do it) and in light of the fact that the company had just suffered a serious cyberattack, i
went this route first of all to make life easier for our extemal users in the sense that they would not need to worry
about the password anymore.It would get generated securely for them using the exact same method used by
Amazon on its public cloud AWS.So each user would get two keys that are necessary for authentication.One is
never communicated but stored securely on the server and it is then used to validate cryptographically the one
our user would use on their end.Also the system was able to create automatically securely and automatically
any number of users be it 10 (ten) or 10,000 (ten Thousands).

The plan was to deploy that bash script using our intema! Ansible.Now this is where the first issues started.Mr
Jason White in my team gave me a call with my Manager Claire thomson in which he asserted and wrongly so
that deploying a bash script with ansible on a linux server "was not real ansible” (i am quoting him here) and that
the best approach was to use yam! files that have the advantage of getting converted into python by ansible
before deployment onto the linux server.However, the reality is that no matter what one is using (bash script,
yam! file...), Ansible will first of ali convert the instructions in Python before sending them to the server and this
can be verified from the official documentation.Also during the meeting, as is custom with him, he was extremely
violent and rude to the point where Claire who is in charge could not place a single word.

He even added on that call that "the method used by this program is identical to what Amazon is doing ;
however as Amazon does not know what they are doing, that woulkd render my efforts useless".| will leave to
each of you the care of judging the extent of that statement and draw whatever logical conclusions can be
drawn from that.

| came out very shaken and upset from this call and had another one right afterwards with my Manager Claire ,
call during which j insisted on the the falsehood of the allegations of my colleague but also of the fact that if,
based on his personal preferences, we cannot make use of a bash script, why then do Amold Clark devops
employees use the bash language on a daily basis in the administration of the linux servers estate ?

But as Claire insisted we go the route of the ansible yaml file, i did it and then went on to write an ansible
deployment file that i will also attach to the present email (vsftp.yaml) for those of you keen on having a
{ook.That script also was fully functional and i was requested by my Manager Claire to review it together with Mr
Jason White.And as is customary with him, he not only removed everything i did put into that file and told me
that instead of rebuilding the server from scratch with that script, he would rather want me to rebuilt it and this is
where it is interesting by copying the passwords from the old server to the new one.

In light of the cyberattack our company suffered in December and in the name of the basic principles of digital
security hygiene, it is not right to copy the passwords from an old server when rebuilding a server in a company
setting and even more so right after a horrible cyberattack. Instead, a dutiful devops engineer should use a
secure method to reset all of the passwords on the new server and this is what i had in mind as a matter of
dutiful care towards the interest of my employer.

Another question beyond the fact that i hold an MBA in Cybersecurity and many other qualifications in Devops is
to know if that nonetheless qualify me for such an approach that had the highest interest fo the company in mind

—— i waka RE a Py

? I would say yes because beyond the content of my cy, i also graduated in 2020 from Harvard University in
‘Cybersecurity with the highest score ever ebtained which is ane of 100% . | was in the Class of Mrs Debora
Plunkett who was a former director of fhe NSAAs part fo her class, i was involved into the remediation of the
attack suffered by the Los Angeles Airport and was praised many times for my unusual yet deep knowledge of
cyber threat mifigation and this is what that script . violenfly rejected by Mr White was about Rest ensured that i
do not like making gratuitous allegations and will bring tamorrow with me the evidence regarding my Harvard
quaiificaticn in the area.

But the story does not end there ; despite the violence with which i was treated and in spite of the fact that
copying over old passwords to new Servers in an environment which had suffered a recent attack was clearly

wrong and not in the best interest of the company in my modest opinion, i nonetheless accepted the ventict and
went ahead to implement the solution of Mr White.

So i went ahead and implemented the solution Mm question and the whole thing was put in our github repository
and available at the following URL:

 

The password transfer from our servers to the repository above was done in an automated fashion with two
scripts (files users_hashed_passwords and users_with_ssh_keys also attached to the present email) present

since the 29th of March 2023 on both sftp intemal (10.31 2.120) and sftp extemal (10.150.153.17) and which i
also attach to this email for review.

So from the repository above i took a screenshot (also attached to this email as file old |_passwords_itransfer)
where you can see 4 lines that are in red .These lines are the ones that were put into the file by Mr Jason White
and i left them there, on purpose, so that during the review he could have his code proposal right next to mine
for comparison purpose .These fines are the only reason why a tiny portion one of the test did fail but otherwise
this script is also perfectly functional and written in a fashion more than acceptable in the ansible worid.When i
got back to him afterwards for review, he told me that we would do it later as there was no rush back then. So i
left it in state until my Manager Claire, moved the task to someone else.However that repository is again a proof
that the job, no matter how disturbed i was by it in terms of the company interest, was done successfully.

| will now move on to the second part of my email which is to deal with the task of “terraforming” our AWS cloud
assets.

2/ Writing the terraform configuration for all the assets of Arnold Clark on AWS Cloud.

My first task here was to put into terraform the configuration of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) our company has
on AWS Cloud.

So my first approach was to write these configurations from scratch (so not making use of the "terraform import"
command) and | first of al! wrote these configuration with the latest version of terraform : So my plan was to use

the awscli to query the attributes of the vpc from AWs and then use these attributes to write their terraform
configurations.| took that route because:

-It gives you a better understanding of how the VPC works. When you write the configuration from scratch,
you have to understand the different components of a VPC and how they interact with each other. This
understanding will help you troubleshoot problems and make changes to the VPC as needed.

-It allows you to customize the VPC to your specific needs. When you use a pre-made module, you are
limited to the features that are included in the module. If you need to customize the VPC, you will need to modify
the module, which can be difficult and time-consuming.

-It makes it easier to manage the VPC. When you have a custom Terraform configuration, you can use
Terraform to manage the entire VPC, including creating, updating, and destroying resources. This makes it
easier to keep track of changes to the VPC and to ensure that the VPC is always in a consistent state.

a a scenery ee

Of course, there are also some disadvantages to writing the Terraform configuration from scratch and Claire
i ly pointed them out to me hence the fact i started using the “teraform import” commands for the task.

Now as an AWS Solutions Architect (i also attach to this email a copy of my certificate number
SNXAZSJSHMQXZ finally validated on the 6th of May 2023) and thanks to the numerous training i took in my
previous job from a company called Acioudgumy, i wrote the configuration for the 22 VPC by organizing each
Configuration in a separate folder/project. And the proof cf it is available from the following link

 

So as you can see, we have 22 folders for 22 vpc and the terraform code for every single of these vpcs is 100%
functional.On top of this there is an accounting script able to tell us how many vpc we have in each region.

AWS recommends this approach for the following reasons:

-Organization: !t will help to keep your code organized and easy to manage. You can create a folder for each
VPC and then put all of the Terraform configuration for that VPC in the folder. This will make it easy to find the
configuration for a specific VPC and to understand how the VPC is configured.

-Tracability: It will make it easier to track changes to each VPC. lf you make a change to the configuration for
a VPC, you can easily see the change in the code. This will help you to troubleshoot problems and to
understand how the changes affect the VPC.

-Deployment: It will make it easier to deploy changes to individual VPCs. If you need to deploy a change toa
specific VPC, you can simply deploy the changes to the folder for that VPC. This will prevent you from
accidentally deploying changes to other VPCs.

If anyone wants to verify, they will need to clone the repository above, get into any vpc which name starts with

“vpc” and then run in it the commands “terraform init", then the content of the import commands file and finally
the command “terraform plan".All of them do work.

But when i completed that task, my manager advised that i rather follow the same pattern as the one on our
Azure Cloud repository. recall having said that these 2 clouds are overall differents and that rewriting the code
destined for separate project into one single file was no simple task because of the sheer number of
adjustments to make it work and this is where i spent some time since merging all the configuration under a
single project and get it to work perfectly was not an easy task ; becasue we are talkking about getting 22
separate files with more than a thousand lines of code to get merged into a single project.So last week, on
thursday during a meeting with Claire, i did present a little breakthrough in terms of merging all the
configurations into a single file.| made a demonstration for the proof of concept during 2 session with my
manager who then did seem satisfied with the fact we are now approaching the end of that road.She even
Suggested to me what the next step would be once i would be done.

3/ The interaction to date with my direct manager

So taken into account the fact i never got direct complaints or warning from my manager and taken into account
the discussion last week on the same day i received the letter, you Can now imagine and understand the extent

of my surprise and shock and i must say that i have been totally under since thursday as this is creating some
very mixed feelings as you can imagine.

The only thing | can remember that might have triggered this was at the end of the discussion last week when
she asked me if i had asked the help of Mr White for the then ongoing merging process.| responded that i hadn't
for 3 reasons: first i generally talk to Miss Zoe whenever necessary as she is very capable in that area; secondly
it is my belief that i was on the right track which she confirmed last week by herself. And Thirdly, i must say that i
am notin general too fond of getting anywhere near Mr White as he is most likely the most verbally abusive,

brutal, loud and disrecpectful person i ever came across and i once complained about him and his absolutely
terrible manners to my direct manager.

Between his never ending rather vulgar insults, during teams mesfings , about the other teams who are are
always systematically qualified after the use of, you will excuse me, the "F" word, his total lack of respect for
everyone including our manager wham he would systematically interrupt during team meetings to my disbelief to
this day, the fact that ke once allowed himself to shush her in front of everyone , his systematic attempts to
belittle me in particular and Some of his comments about my direct manager during one of our meesngs, i

So from the meeting of last week, this is the only thing i could remember that could have triggered this and i

hope i am totally wrong but before that i did not get any warming about what appears to be my lack of
qualifications and abilities.

So i provided you above with verifiable evidence that i am not fost in terms of the use of the systems of our
company and contrary to the perception, i have managed to accomplish the task required of me unt now. The
onty recent difficulty as i mentioned being that it took a lot of efforts to try merging into a single file some
complex and long configurations that were initially designed to be modular in terns with what Amazon is
preaching about its service and you have my AWS certificate and the github repository to attest to this.

Also and i would like to emphasize that, i have never had any problems i can remember of with my manager Mrs
Thomson whom i appreciate both as a manager and a person of very good character.

But without any prior waming, mentioning the Possibility of ending my contract tomorrow came as a total shock

from which ij have not recovered to be honest and i would like the evidence i provided above to be assessed
with impartiality.

Also finally, with my constant effort to be not onty mindful but respectful of the interest of the company, my
attempt to apply the generally admitted rules for the task required of me, the fact that the goals set for me were
not a failure and my real respect for my manager from whom i never received a waming for my work, i think it is
extremely unfair for me to be in this situation now.Also we have, and i have detailed it above some characters in
the team with an attitude that would guarantee in other settings, an immediate dismissal for gross misconduct;

but these characters are instead left in peace when they terrorize everyone around them with open brutality and
verbal abuse and this is not right to me.

i have been in a state of distress since last thursday to be honest to the point where i had an accident without
consequences this weekend and ended up speaking to my neigbour and friend who is a lwayer at a well
established firm in Edinburgh Without of course sharing any of the links and materials in this email but by simply
giving him some verbal explanations which he got because he also happen to have a technical background, he
gave me some advice that are , to be honest , contrary to what i want in terms of relations with a company i
sincerely like and care for.But i am really really disappointed and in total disbelief with what is taking place and i
would really like fo humbly ask for real faimess during our meeting tomorrow because at the moment, all of this
makes me feel really bad and this is clearly not right at all in my opinion.

Despite all i am going through at the moment, rest ensured that i will be attending the meeting tomorrow and
truly hope that an independant and fair assessment of the elements i provided will be done to avoid what is
clearly not right in my modest opinion.My line managers (both Ciaire and David) know me to be a person of
good character and i do intend to maintain that attitude during the meeting tomorrow.Also i really want to
emphasize that my upbringing and values will guarantee you the preservation of my reputation of good
character so please rest ensured that i am not coming tomorrow in a confrotational mood.! am just coming to
you in the hope you would have assessed fairly the elements provided above.

| believe in your faimess and hope the Human resources will help in the accomplishment of this tomorrow.

Yours faithfully,

Mory-Marcel Sangare

Management [DM)

this meeting today, em, I know you sent me an email, so what we'l do is we'l go through that
in a bit of detail during the meeting as well alright

MMS: ok
LC.

!have reviewed it obviously pnor to this meeting but we'll just go through it just so that I an get a
bit of info from yourself. So we've obviously got David Middleton who is the head of digital talent
development sitting in this meeting today, and does advise yourself that you have the right to be
accompanied today, are you ok on your own today
it

MMS sorry missed your last sentence
LC:

are you ok on your own today, you do have the right to be accompanied

MMS: no, no its fne
LC:

ok perfect, alright so as it advises in the letter, I am looking to discuss concemns with your overall
capability within your role as Dev ops engineer and that's specifically in relation to your failure to
perform tasks in a timely manner, utilise our systems efficiently and to perform the tasks expected
in your role to the standards expected. I just want to make you aware as it says in the letter, a
potential outcome is the termination of your employment, so I just want to reiterate that before I
start alright. So there are a few concerns I just want to go through so what I'll probably do first
Marcel is l'II go through concerns that have been made aware to myself. And then once we've
gone through all that we'll then go through your email, because there's a few points I want to
discuss In a bit more detail with yourself regarding that

MMS:

no problem

LC:

So the first point in relation to what was brought to my attention, was that you seemed to struggle
with the distributed version control systems, what's your thoughts on you know your abilities with
that system

MMS:

I mean the ..... obviously the ........ we using Github full version control right, so you can actually see
every single bit of code you know but I've been writing since I started, is all there. So when ..... you
know In the statement I'm struggling with, I just don't get it because everything I've been writing is
there, you know, every time I need to update some code I'm doing it from Github so, when l'm
being told that I'm struggling, I mean someone's struggling to use Github or someone unable to
push some code on Github unable to push some code, its absolutely not my case, I've been pushing
code on Github since January so
.

LC:

ok

MMS:. wtyare the only thing l an thurl of was l think maybe it was 34 weels because yu know
right now V'm workmg atyou know Arnold lark is using many douis, using from.
the tp
ofry head using mostly Azure and ANS, when 1 stared was told t artually use a language cafled
Terraform t actually write the configuration for absolutely al the virtual private doud we have on
AW, and r've been doing this for qurte some time 23
7 the only remark l an think of was a l think
34 weeks ago where as ! said when l first wrote the configura tion because Amazon is actually
recommending t whenever we trying to write some pre-pieces which are actually private, lets all
them private networks, so we have many private networks, so what they are recommending is
actually trying t follow the modular approach
LC:

ok

MMS:

so instead of having all the configuration for absolutely all your private networks in a single fle
which is actually risky, it is risky in the sense that you know, if you're doing anything wrong, instead
of destroying one private network, you're going to destroy the entire networks for Arnold lark
worldwide which is a catastrophe itself, so this is why from the get go l've been writing it in a
modular fashion, and l also mentioned yesterday you know, I used to work at Amazon before, this
is not the first time l'm writing amazon Terraform code for AWS and on top of that even when you
go to TT school, any IT schools and these days before l actually recommended to write on code
using .what do you call it, unobjected rented approach so some 4
:24 and some spaghetti code all
in one go you just need to break things into modules and this is precisely what l've been doing

LC:

ok

MMS:

now 3 weeks ago I recalled that I was actually ........I wrote it in the modular fashion, now I was told
to move away from the modular fashion and have old configuration in the single file. The first risk I
saw there was actually by doing that with a single mistake I could have basically destroyed all the
networks for .....all the private networks for Arnold Clark AWS, which is you know something really
bad and something very unprofessional so, I was taking a bit of time, back then I was taking hours, I
wasn't pushing codes every day, because I was really trying to reassess the situation, how to move
from modules I've been writing to something 517

LC:

ok

MMS:

so I was not pushing code every day and I recall my direct manager Claire, told me that I should be
pushing a bit more often and I told her ok I will do so but as I did explain to her, you know I wasn't
pushing every day because l was practically reassessing how to move from 5:35 to all in one

LC:

ok

MMS:

and one thing can I also mention is all the individual modules I've been writing for the VPC AWS,
absolutely all of them are working perfectly

LC:

ok

MMS: and they are good to operate now, so being told that

551 1don't get it

LC:

ok, is that something that you're able to expand on David

OM:

so I think it helps if we narrow it down, so its not really about VPC's or any of the other stuff you
went on to talk about, so I'm a 60
3 engineer to trade, as well, ok, so when using Github I would

have expected you t be doing multiple commits per day, so not just committing start of day, end
of day or start of task, completed task we want t see your working as well so when Claire's talking
t you about em, well commit every day and reminding you to commit every day its so you do that
rather than send her emails and sreenshots and all that kind of thing
MMS:

no no, the I'm really sorry, the only time where I did share some sreenshots and an email
with her, is when we were discussing the issue of the you know, of rebuilding the rTP server fr the
company, that was the only time l sent her sreensho t and quite frankly you know, you can share
de on Github but there is no 1 don't think there is anything wrong with sharing during the
chat a saeensho t or a bit of text just to talk about something, I don't think there is anything wrong
doing that, that's one, secondly, in terms of pushing the code on Github, as l save, I'm,if you
check on the repository the configuration for all the VP's are done and they are working but as I
said, moving from modules to a single file where you risk damaging absolutely everything, you can
be pushing every 2 hours, { was basically trying to re-assess the entire thing, the 22 vPC'slwrote
this is more than a thousand lines of ode so if you take anyone in here or anyone outside unless
he's got an IQ way beyond comprehension, when you're trying to move from 22 modules and
trying to get them into one, you can't be pushing every 2 seconds, you need to re
assess what you
did and trying to move into what was asking, and another thing I've got to say, these 22 modules
and they're in Github right now when I wrote them in this fashion, the aim of it was basically just to
have them what we call loosely coupled, so just trying to avoid them being tightly coupled
together, so obviously when you have private clouds, each living in individual folders, some
variables could be used in one specific project or folder....and being used again in the
this is
the problem I came to face because when we were to put, when I was asked to put all of them into
one single folder, I needed to reassess the variable, I needed to reassess the ....you know all the
results I created, this was not.......this is not a piece of cake, this is why pushing every two seconds
or every two hours was simply not feasible, I was reassessing the entire thing and last week I've
been doing that since last month basically and last week I actually had
as I said its really not
easy, last week I had a meeting with her to talk about that and I showed her the new way I was
trying to ....the new path I was trying to follow to achieve that so basically I had to re-write the
configuration for all of them because it was becoming unmanageable to be frank, I rewrote the
configuration for all of them and when I finished rewriting the configuration for all of them,
basically I was trying to merge these VPC two by two, so last week on Thursday we had a meeting,
you know, the teams call on teams, and I did show her the full concept so I basically managed to
merge, after re-writing the configuration after using this new methodology, I did manage to merge
I think 4 maybe 6 all in one so the purpose of the meeting was no more because she saw it was
working so the next step was doing it for all the others and if you check on Github, it turn out to be,
not to be able to use, there is a new folder called refactoring and inside that folder you'll find 10
groups, so, I've been, what I've been trying to do right now was to actually
what I've
achieved right now was inside every group you'll find the merge folder to which you have basically
the configuration that its merged and working and I was moving to the next step, so, there were 22
........ 10 and then Sand so on after the point I would get to a single configuration that is safe for the
company and AWS and that's all I was doing and this is what I mentioned you know, I mentioned
that yesterday I even sent a screenshot, you know when you taking the calls for the cloud architect
on AWS, they do not recommend you use, first of all telephone calls because it's a risky
.its a
risk, you can destroy your cloud asset, so all l'm trying to make here aware of these, l'm not
struggling with Github and secondly moving from the modular approach to an approach where you
have everything into a single file, you need to be careful, you know today we could have been here
because I would have inadvertently destroyed all the asset of Arnold Clark on AWS, how would we
have caught that, that would have been total incompetence and in the email I sent yesterday it is
the same thing I've been talking about again and again, when I was asked to write to rebuild the
SFTP server, and this is why I mentioned the fact that its not on my CV but here it is you can

properly cherk, l got it from Harvard university you can see, T'm literally you don't need to take my
word for it, T'en literally the only person that came cut from that, fram Harvard university with a
periert sore, its right there
DM.

thats not the issue at hand,

MMS:

no, no, no I'm getting there, so what I'm trying to make you aware of is you know, in everything I've
been tying to do, l've been trying to bank on the knowledge I have and I have been trained to help
the interests of the company at hand, the SFP server for example, was asked to rebuld, the de
is there, as you can see, the incident would have been fully secure, the system would have been
able whether you wanted to create 10 aunt or 10 thousand to create them automatically
without zero intervention, because its 500 fines of code and on top of that, I was, we were both
trying to avoid copying the password from the old server into the new one which is unprofessional
and which is something you don't do after a cyber attack so when I'm talking about that, it might
not look like the issue at hand but when you're doing your job you need to bring first of all what
knowledge you have and this knowledge can be coming from your work experience or your
integrational level and secondly you need to be having....you need to have interest of the
company at heart, this is why I've mentioned all these things so the two main tasks I was given to
deal with, rebuilding SFTP server and dealing with the amazon cloud, it was always done in the
direction of having it being efficient and not breaking anything that's all 1 was doing

LC:.

can !just ask just kind of for my understanding so David you may need to assist here, so is what
you're saying in terms of when you're being asked to do a task with specific systems you feel that
those systems that we're asking you to use could result in a risk to the business therefore you're
taking it upon yourself to use another system

MMS:

no, no, this is not what I said

LC:

no, no its just I'm just trying to

MMS:

ok, I'm going to repeat again, t was given mostly two task in here, the first one was rebuilding the
SrTP server, so the SFTP server is basically used by Amold Clark to exchange some files with
external partners. Now as you know we got hacked and the company got an encroachment breach,
so after an information breach unfortunately you need to consider absolutely all your assets are
suspicious so I'm aware that the remaining servers we have were scanned but you know despite
the fact they were scanned, when I was asked to rebuild the server I would have never even
thought about copying the old passwords from the old server, to move them across to the new
one, why? Because first, as of now only limits access we have, we don't have central application we
don't have you know, our windows servers the one are using I think Delta, on the Linux side we
could have used something like 1
456 or even 1
4:59 but we have no central application on our
servers and despite the fact that these servers were scanned, when I was asked to rebuild and no
specifications were given at that stage, but in my understanding when you are being asked to
rebuild the server, in an environment where there is no central application you don't copy the
password across, this is a lack of professionalism and this is risking the business after the cyber
attack and this is why that piece of code you saw, it is, it was basically rebuilding the server and
generating some passwords of 70 characters which is extremely hard, to break even with a cluster
for every single customer's automatically, in the old servers we had the password were generated
manually which was making management of that very difficult. On the new server, not only the
server was fully automated I mean in terms of building, in terms of generating the password
the
methodology I've used is basically, there were two keys generated, one key is given to the user, you
used that to authenticate and there was one key staying on the server, that is used to actually

.

authenticatethe one being used by the customer and the key staying on the server, i mean for
sumneone t get aess t that, that person will need t have 1625 expert which isfeasible but
then again you know not within the grasp of everyo ne so, when I was rebuilding that server l was
not ignoring the orders given to me, absolutely not, just happened with my bagro und in cyber
security l just happen to know a lot of cyber security and everything l mentioned there, that's wty I
brought hat.
not to show off, 'm not trying to show off, but ! do hold it and l'm that person,
so, when l was doing that, to me, it was unthinka ble to do that, now when l wrote that script as I
said one of my colleagues, Mr Jason White, I've mentioned, he came forward and said that we an't
be using that suipt against, Ansible and you know, against Ansible, unfortunately this is not true at
all, and during that meeting ...beca use my boss actually made me aware quite a few times that
she was not necessarily familiar with Ansible, but when you're using Ansible to deploy on a server,
there are two kind of programme you can use, you can use the Yam! configuration or you can use a
bash script, now I've been using Linux servers for almost 30 years now, I'm not the kind of person
that will be writing the script down for example, if that was the case I wouldn't have been able to
handle all these large customers I was handling at NCR fr all these years and all the other
companies before, so my..as l said, l was told, Marcel you need to rebuild that server. That
server will be exposed to the outside world, we've suffered a cyber attack so what do you do, lwas
not copying across the password so, what was trying to say here is when my colleagues told me,
when first of all he said that we shouldn't be using bash script which is not true because all our
Linux servers use bash script for the management and when he said that you should be copying the
password during that meeting, my boss was there, I tried a little bit to say that was not a good idea,
but again ok I was told ok you do that so I did it and even for the copying of password for both
SSSG's and password from the old server to the new one, the approach that was committed by my
colleague was a manual one, on our servers right now, I wrote two script that are automating
process and this is the link I shared, so on the link I shared you can see there are 4 lines in red,
these 4 lines in red were the lines added by my colleague and I left them there so that during the
call they could see what his idea was and what I did, that's all I did. But, unfortunately, my boss,
wrongly assumed that this task was a failure, its not true, the code is right there and I left his lines
on purpose
LC:

and I think from speaking with David, I don't think like in terms of that specific task that's not of a
concern for us, that wasn't something that you were concerned with that task that Marcel's put
forward was it

DM:

no, we're not asserting that it was a failure either, we're saying that it was no longer required,
however, if I could just point out a few things, Jason White wasn't saying you couldn't use bash
scripts in the absolutist term, the part which I think is the core of the problem here is you were
employed as a infrastructural code engineer primarily to use Terraform and Ansible, there may well
be bash scripts in there already, there absolutely is, however, the entire point of your role being
created, and the strategic objective of the department is to not use bash script any more. So the
struggle that I have is when Jason said that to you why you didn't get on board with the strategy,
why
.

MMS: this is a very good question,
OM:

the reason you just gave there was Claire and Jason are 20:18 and that's

.

MMS:

no, no, sorry just around that specific point, maybe you were not listening when I was talking and
its written there, when as I say the first thing I say is I went for the bash script, not because I can't
use yam! files, no, because there were many things to do and doing the same thing, using yaml file
we've created the file is massive so when we had that meeting where he said, because what he

Page5 of41-sT
Laura C/Jure 2023/Continued Employment Meeting wth Mory-Marcet Sangare - 20-06-23

171

said, firs of all 1 was never made aware of the fat that the mpany was ending use bash, and if
the company is not using hash from now on, it's a state, it wan't be able to do the administratio n
tut that was not tie pint, he saidthat using the 2100 was not possible, I wrote it down, this is not
true. That's one, secondly, in the email sent, when he said that we shouldn't be using bash script,
l tried to explain myself as to why l used bash script and the bash script
.bash is code, we're
not talking about 21-17 de, bash is part of it,just t be dear, so when he's said that, I rewrote the
entire script using Ansible and I have this fle in py of the email l sent,
on Githab to and that
code was also working, when i presented that ode again, there were many parts for it, there was
one part t configure the SSSG's for the custom ers, there was one part configure the password and
there was also one part to deal with the security because if again we were to open that server to
the extemal world you know we needed to be a minimum careful, and I rewrote that its attached
that email in yam! but when we reviewed that code with him, he deleted most of it and this is when
he insisted on the fact we will transfer the old passwo rd from the old server to the new one and
this is wty l've been insisting on the fact that, for someone who graduated from Harvard university
for someone who's been working in IT for almost 20 years I've been using Linux for 30, to me that
was a bit of a shock, I tried to say that maybe this is not a good idea, I was not listened to and you
know what ! did, I complied and the compliance and the act of compliance is precisely what l'm
talking about you know, that link I sent where you can see 4 lines in red, this is precisely what I was
22-4 if you look at the bottom of it, you can see the hash of the password which was meant to be
deployed on the server using Ansible, this is what l've been saying from beginning, I wrote it
personally I felt I was I felt bad about it because as I mentioned, in my mind doing that and with the
salary I'm receiving here in my mind doing that was not having the interests of the company at
heart but 1 was asked to do it I didn't argue with anyone, I did it, and this is what l said, thankfully
its recorded so you can listen to it and its written there. So, I didn't refuse to do that, I didn't
refuse, absolutely not, I did it even though it didn't feel quite right, and when I did it what it told
me was ok you know its not the 23:38 task at the moment, we have time, we will review it later, so,
after that I moved onto the Terraform task, yeah so this is what happened, I've not refused, at no
time I was told that using bash is against the company interest, because if that were the case, the
company wouldn't be using Linux, as far as l'm aware you can go online, get checked the offshore
documentation. When you want to deploy on a Linux estate you can either use yaml configuration
or bash scripting. I understand that most people are not very good with bash scripting, I know I'm
aware of that and this is why when they said so I moved to yaml file, but I happen to have a colossal
experience with bash scripting and even Jason himself if you ask him will tell you that. I can write
some bash scipt to do absolutely anything. I've been using that language since when, 1993? Almost
40 years now, so I sort of know what I'm talking about you know so I'm not deficient in Ansible and
I've never refused to do anything that was asked from me, I always did it even though, this is what
.....even though I had my fears, I mean try to put yourself in my place, I'm the only person alive that
came out from Harvard university with 100% cyber security you know, I'm well known, at least in
my circle of friends and so on, and I come to work for Arnold Clark, and I am copying password
after a cyber breach, I'm copying password from an old server to a new one, how would you feel if
you were
i
ts

LC:

did you raise concerns about that to management at all, that you felt that you weren't comfortable
with the process and your concerns

MMS:

this is what I mentioned during the meeting, during that meeting even Claire couldn't utter a word,
Jason was shouting at me, now when you hear me talk in here, do you truly believe that I couldn't
shout back, I can, but this is not polite, this is not the way I was raised if you see what I mean, and I
also mentioned that but during the meeting my manager is there, he is first of all telling me that
the way I'm committed the security on the server which is the same used by Amazon to this day,
for AWS, he told me that this is not what Amazon is doing is wrong because Amazon doesn't know

Page 6of41-ST

172

what they are doing, are you kidding me, are you kidding me, Amazn doesn't inow what they are
ding., Tm not a fanatic of Amazon there are many things they are doing wrong, happened t have
worked there but jesus hrst, in tens of ayptgraphic key implem entation they do know what
they're talking about, if you see what l mean, so when during that meeting he tld me that using a
bash sript is not real Ansble whirh is a fie by the way, when he tld me what Amazon don't know
what they are doing and when we moving from and it's a 26:26 when we moving from that yaml
le where I'm trying t take into aunt a minimum of security , to a point we're copying old
passwo rd across what do l do after that. My boss was there when the meeting was on, what do l
do, l committed the solution even though l was tom apart inside, I committed the solution
LC.

and at that point did you raise ike your oncems that you maybe weren't comfortable with the
process

MMS: this is what l'm saying, this is precisely because that was wrong to do so, that, when l was told, with
zero instruction I was told rebuild the server, I did rebuild the server, I did commit some,l even
presented you know what I have my computer here, I even .. regarding that specific task, I even
presented to Claire and Mr David Moffat, that was in January l even made a presentation during
which I showed them how I rebuild the server automatically, how we will have a script that could
build, can you imagine, a script that could build...the server itself, if we have 100 new partners,
that are coming along and saying ok you know we need 100 accounts right now, you log onto the
server, you launch the script, all you need to do is just choosing their user names, and the user
name you choose, you know what if that is one of the user names is already in use the server will
let you know, the code is there but it will use these user names, building password with the length
of at least 70 characters its in the code there and then once we its finishing that you'll get on your
home directory the folder into which a primary folder, inside that primary folder if for example we
are A B and C, you will have A, inside A you will have the user name and password to use, the user
name password and key to connect to the server but the key I'm talking about is not the key that is
on the server that one stays there and that was it, that part was all about streamline the process.
When you're working as a Devops what is your game, its automating as much as you can and also
you know being mindful of the statutory security but the code was written in that sense, I'm being
told that you know Ansible doesn't use bash which is a lie, I insist on that right, I didn't discuss, I'm
being told that the Amazon methodology l'm using is basically not right you know, my boss was
there, what do I do, I'm committed the solution
DM:

I think we keep going round the same things, fundamentally what the team were saying was you
weren't following the strategy of the team and your position is that it wasn't right. I think basically

MMS:

look I think you are not listening to me, I was following

DM:

I definitely am listening

MMS:

no no,

DM:

but you keep on bringing up parts that we're not contesting

MMS:

no no, I'm sorry when I was given the task I was just told rebuild the server that's all I was told, I'm
repeating myself again, when I was given the task I was just being told rebuild the server, that was
it yes ok and when I was told
.

DM:

none of this is in contention that's my point

Page 7of41-5T

173

MMS: oak ok but as you don't seem to get it s T'm repeating here, so when l was tid that, i rebuilt the
server using the you inow the rerommended proced ure is what T've been saying then my colleague
Jason id me that firs of all ior having written the script in bash is a mistake, because Ans@ble
doesn't use bash whuh is nct true, when l phone l said, secondly he told me that the method I was
putting in place which was generating two keys was not right even though it is,identical to what
Amazn is doing because Amazon doesn't know what they' re doing, that was second, third point
it

DM:

we've gone round this again and again, what the team are saying t you is,isn't in the specifics of
Ansible doesn't use bash script, the point is we don't want you writing bash scripts

MMS: yeah and what t'm telling you is when I was given the task l was never told that you shouldn't be
using bash script and when he said so during that meeting, I rewrote the whole thing in Ansible
instead, it's a fact that, in yaml sorry
DM:

I understand that, but that was the first task just after you started with the business

MMS: ok
DM.

we didn't talk about it in a statement we spoke about it in the second part, what we also spoke
about your use of Github,

MMS: ok which is the repository is right there
OM:

which doesn't have the number of commits that I would have expected, its got a fraction of the
commits that I would have expected

MMS: ok and as I told you l was refactoring more than a thousand lines of code, this is not......
DM:

which I would like to see intermediate steps from

MMS: ok ok but what I was doing
DM:

.

Which is what Claire asked you to do on a daily basis

MMS: and I was doing it you know, when I was
DM:

every day

look, lets be specific, you didn't do it because Claire had to ask you every single day

MMS: no not every single day, no, she asked no no sorry
OM:

many many days then I don't have the specifics to hand,

MMS:

I do have the specifics

DM:

more days than is acceptable

MMS:

she was not asking me that every single day, no this is not true and I have a screen shot of that as I
said when I moved from the modules to a single file you know you need to realise the situation, this
is code, you understand

DM:

1do understand yes

Page 8 of41-5T
Laura C/June 2023/Continued Employment Meeting with Mory-Marcel Sangare - 20-06.23

174

MMS:. so you do mienstand that s, moving from modules t a single file, it takes some reflection, and
this is when tar and! first spoke about this is what t told her, l said ofcourse l agree with
yu but the thing is I'm just trying to reassess the situation and when l started to reassess the
situation ! was making some changes and these hanges l was pushing on Github that was through
the consequence of the work ! was doing on my local machine every single day, this is what l'm
trying t tell you
it

DM:

yes but that needs to be pushed up

MMS:

but what i'm trying to tell you is l'm not a computer, I'm a human being just ike yourself

DM:

andl'm

MMS: so when t'm trying to refator 1000 lines of ode you cannot expet me to push every two seconds
DM:

no, but l expect you to push broken code to show your working and thought process so that we can
all collaborate together to create the right solution for the business and that's the part which we
fundamentally think you're not understanding

MMS: no, I think you are not listening to me you're just trying to confirm the fact that l can't use Github
which is not true, I'm sorry as l said its 1000 lines of code, ok, when you have 1000 lines of code to
refactor into a single file it takes some time...it takes some time even to modify, so I spend a lot
of time, if you look on Github for example, every single, ......the code you'll find most of it and I
can bet my life on it if you want, is very robust, it is working but the
.
DM:

lets not look at this in contention this particular...-......

MMS: but what I'm trying to tell you is, I'm not a computer, I'm not a robot, I'm a human being, I take the
code I visualise it I analyse it, I try to find where I can modify it and once I find it I modify it and
push this is what I've been doing but I'm not doing so every 2 hours, no
LC:

so what's the expectation like how often would the expectation be to push the code

DM:

we're expecting something around 5-6 times a day

LC:

and would you say that that's something that you do

MMS:

I don't know but as l'm saying again, as l'm saying again, I am not pushing because the other thing
is, to actually counter what you've just said, if I was not actually sitting at my desk and thinking
about these things how would you explain then the fact that I went from one version of the code
maybe in the morning or the previous day that is not working that is not complete to a version the
following day where there is maybe a new file that is added with modifications that I explained
what happened previously, it is because there was some brain work in the middle, all I'm trying to
tell you is I'm not you, you know, I'm not a computer, I'm just a regular human being who needs to
analyse things before making a change, and that's all I did

OM:

so my challenge back to you, I'm trying to help you here by narrowing down the scope of our
conversation,

MMS: ok

Page 9of41-5T
Laura C/June 2023/Continued Employment Meeting with Mory-Marcel Sangare - 20-06-23

175

DM:

we have a team that you're rth ofaps engineers ok

MMs. ok

D0M:

18 product squads, around about 100 engineers in the department and they an all work in the way
that I'm suggestingyou should be working and you're suggestingyou must work in a different way

MMS:

no, no you are not one more time and have to insist on that, this is where its good its
recorded, you are not listening to what Km saying, what l'm trying to tell you, what l'm desperately
trying to make you understand is when you have to refactor more than parallel fines of code which
are written in the modular fashion, t a single fle, ok, you cannot do that just every . like a
machine, every two seconds, maybe 3510 an do it but l can't, l'm sorry but that's 35:13 what
tend to do is taking the code I have, analyse it to make sure I'm not breaking the company
infrastructure because this is another thing you forgetting, I've been telling you that when l was
told to and l also wrote about it,when l was told to ....move it t a single file, I also tried in a
quiet voice to raise the fact that putting all of it in a single file is actually a risk because if someone
who is not me, were to take the code and even run some test he would run the risk of breaking all
the VPCs so all the virtual private doud networks for Amold Clark on live worldwide, don't you
think this is a risk that requires you to really carefully analyse every single step you're taking and
this is what l was doing and as l said the people you're talking about maybe they're just refactoring
some things they've been working on for maybe for months or years at hand, I was trying to move
from the modular structure to a unified one and this is not easy task, it requires a lot of analysis
and I don't know maybe you have the brain power to do so in two seconds, I don't so I take the
time to analyse this

DM.

that's not what we're contesting again, we're contesting your ways of working and what you're
telling me is that your ways of working as described by Claire and your team are correct, you aren't
working in a way that they work, which is we don't........

MMS: yeah because I'm not thinking the way they are I don't agree

.

DM:

we have 100 people outside who ......do it in this way

MMS:

I'm not talking about 100 people I'm talking about myself, sir, with all due respect

OM:

I don't want you to commit the finished product, I want you to commit in bits, so I want to see the
fact that you go down an alleyway that doesn't work, you come back up that alleyway and go down
a new alleyway

MMS:

ok but then the question I'm asking you, is as I told you what I do is, I have the code in front of me
on a rather large screen, I try to analyse it, I'm trying to make sure that whatever change I will
bring, because whatever change I will bring won't be breaking all the VPC's because this is ..... the
precisely
what I was doing, the size I was taking, that was one of the risks so I identified, so
what I tend to do is I'm telling you I have the code in front of me, I look at it carefully, I go down
and analyse the integration amongst all the parts, and once its all clear in my mind then I'm trying
to make some modifications, I test locally and when it is working I push this, that what I've been
doing

DM:

but that's too late,

MMS:

but this is not to late, this is our assertion beause.

DM:

irtsan assertion

MMS: what l'mn trying t make you understand
might have a different brain ok, ok, so what I'm trying
to do is, you cannot ask me.what you're telling me here is I should be thinking the same way
you do, I'm not you, 1 have a different DNA, I have a different brain and I happen to also know what
T'm doing the proof is there, so you an't ask me t be coding the same way you do, I'm not you,
I'm a different person
is,

LC:

think in terms of the department because correct me if l'm wrong again, you work as a team,
therefore there is the requirement to Ike you said push it every like several times a day
because then that point the teams management .....-.

MMS: we have the logs and this is what l'm trying to kill myself saying is this is what l've been doing, I
could not be pushing every single second, I was playing with the integrity of all the virtual private
cloud on AWS, this is not easy task ok and the point you're trying to emphasise you shouldn't be
emphasising this point because if we were ft in good faith, we should be looking at the result,
every single day.at the start of the day you see the code in a certain state, at the end of the day
you see it in a different state, that is fully operational that is coming with improvement, this is what
we should be focusing on, we not focusing on the result here, you asking me to think like you, I'm
not you, and I will never be
LC:

1don't think it's a case of that you're being asked to think like anyone else its just that in terms of
the department, there's processes that we require you to follow in order to work collaboratively

MMS:

that's what l kill myself to make you understand you know we would have been having that
argument if the job was not done and I was sitting home daydreaming, this is not the case, I have
and you can check the logs, I happen to be most of the time the one logging in first, I very often am
the one logging in last and from one day to another you can actually see some massive
improvement in the code every single time, I'm sorry this is how I happen to think and work, you
know, I analyse things, I think I work them, I look at them I try to work the interaction and once l'm
sure that's not going to break something then I start to modify and when I finish the modify I need
to insist I test on my machine first, when its working then I push it this is what I've been doing and I
don't think this is a crime, there is no way in my contract where its written you know, in my
contract as an employee of Arnold Clark, my aim is to get things to work at the end of the day, so at
the end of the day everything I've been writing for the past 7 months is working is there its got the
interest of the company at heart and you can see that and what you're telling me is you should
have been modifying it every two seconds and I can't, its not because I'm lazy or stupid, maybe you
might think I am but my code can attest for me, I'm not stupid, I'm not lazy maybe I happen to
think differently from you that's all, and its not a crime, because we should be looking at the result
here, the code is there, jesus christ, the code is there, its working you can see some improvement
all the time you don't focus on that, you focus on the fact that I should be coding the same way as
other people, no this is not right, this is clearly not right

OM:

so when this particular session you're correct we're not looking at the result because the results
aren't what we're talking about just now, you are an employee of Arnold Clark, a member of the
Arc ops team,

MMS:

yeah

DM:

and yu have t wrkwith those people

M1MS: T'm woriing-

DM.

working a solution and provide workings at the end that's not

MMS: no no and this is what you're saying is also not true because they are not
DM:

whirh part is not true, I've been writing software sine I was 10 years old

MM5: ok for me its all the same, don't worry
DM.
MMS:.

which part is all the same
no no writing ode from a very young age, don't worry for me, its exactly the same thing, if you

want I can even tell you something not related that I happen to have built a rather powerful spare
computer too, you know, most people would not believe that but you know you've been writing
code since you were 10, congratulations for me its all the same so all l'm trying to make you
understand here, what l'm trying to make you aware is talking about you, I'm not you and I would
never be,

DM.

l'm not..-..

MMS: what you should be judging me on is the result
DM:

no that's absolutely the assertion that we're trying to get across to you

LC:

the concern isn't the result the concern is the way in which you work

MMS: but every day every single day for the past 7 months, we have a daily meeting in the team.....every
single day, during that team meeting we contracted all the other colleagues and so on, every single
day I happen to talk to Claire or the others, I'm not working in isolation, from the moment we have
a meeting every single day ! must be working the solution, so this statement is also not.........its
mathematically incorrect. I'm taking part in the meeting every day, every time I have a massive
issue where I really don't know where I'm going I would try to get..
talk to Claire, Greig or Zoe,
but once I know where I'm going I will just focus on my work, so what do you want me to do then
like while I'm focussing trying to make sure I'm not destroying the entire infrastructure world wide,
you want me to go and chat about coffee, no, I won't be doing that, no I'm focused on my work,
and this is not a crime,
LC:

we're not saying that's a crime, the concern is and again, chip in if I'm wrong, the requirement is
when you're working within the team that you need to like every day like 5-6 times a day l think
you said, to like push the code whereas the concern is that you're not

MMS: what you've just said right now because the gentleman here is telling me that he's been
programming since he was 10, as I say congratulations to him, I have been in the same situation,
what I'm trying to make everyone aware of is at no time, you know you cannot tell me that because
I'm not pushing code 5-6 times a day I'm not working, this is not true, you can see changes every
day you can see that every time I am pushing there's some massive improvements so to go from
state A in mathematics to a state B that is different, you know when you do B minus A you see the
gap that gap didn't come from the sky, it was brainpower behind it so you cannot be saying that,

because what you should be keeping in mmd iswas l workimg,yes l was, did l have the interests of
the mpanyat heart, yes I did
LC.

we're not disputing that you not working its just the

MMS. but you cannot be asking me t be thinking ke everybody else r'mn not everybody else
LC:

no we're not asking you to think like everyone else, we understand that everyone else works
differently but in terms of when you're working within a team there's certain processes that you
need to ensure that you are following to ensure that the team and the department works well as a
whole, one of which is pushing 56 times a day

MMS: what l'm trying to.....what becauseyou know, what l'm trying to make you aware of is
this is precisely what I wasand the code is there to show you that, now the fact that we've
spent the last 30 minutes trying to make it appear as a bad guy because t'm not pushing 5 times a
day this is wrong
LC.

its not a case of that we're trying to make out that you're a bad guy, I'm just trying to have a
conversation with yourself and to determine....--...

MMS:

Iknow, know, this is why this is good this is recorded, we should be focussing on the result, the
result is there.....-.

LC.

and again we're not disputing the end result,

MMS:

the result is there how can I be blamed not to be thinking like everyone else, so do you also want
me to look like them or something

LC:

no that's not... .....

MMS:

lets make things clearer here, this is why I brought these two folders, madam, maybe its not clear
on my cv, I didn't write all of that, I happen to have Sor 6 degrees,

LC:

you know, that's not something we're disputing

MMS:

one of them being in artificial intelligence and so on, at my place at home, and I spoke about that
many times to Jason and all the others, I have a super computer at home that is just as powerful as
the one using here at Arnold Clark for visualisation, do you think it's a common person doing that,
no, its not a common person doing that so, I cannot be asked to think and act like everyone else no,
this is wrong, this is wrong, what I should be asked rather is do you have the company interest at
heart, yes do, are you qualified for it, way .......I'm very qualified for it, so l'm not being arrogant
here, l'm just trying to be honest about that ok and did it work, it was working so what are we
doing here, you want to know more, because you were coding when you were 10, you know I also
graduated from Oxford university, its right there and I came out top of the class too, you want to
know more, so ......you want me to 46:54 1 am not you, I will never be you, l don't even look like you
but I happen to think differently, I can't be blamed for that, what we should be caring about is the
end result, you have someone here, there's VPC's its more than a 1000 line of code, have you
...you can go up on the log and check, that was written at a very high speed, most people wouldn't
be able to write 20 VPC's in a couple of weeks, they won't be able to manage that ok, I
was......you're talking about my colleagues, when they are sleeping l'm working, you know why,
because maybe it will sound very unprofessional or something but I really didn't want to disappoint

Clair beause I file her very murh as a person and as a manager ok, so, here you have samepane
here, maybe the only crime IT've committed is to be maybe not an idiot, t don't #now, Tm just trying
to think, l ires myself 100%, when my colleagues are sleeping l work, when they are working IT'm
working, this is why you see these massive changes in no time, you know and! happen t be
thinking differently sorry, you know, you old me you started to de at 10, l did the same, maybe
you have 6 degrees Ike me, ok, 1 an even tell you something else you know you're going t ask me
so if you've got all these things, you know, wty did you come to Scotland my daughter went to
university aged 11, she got her bachelors degree aged 13, and her masters at 14, do you think
that's a good reason enough to come to Scotland and work, yes, it is and all these details I'm giving
you are just to show you that i am not everybody else and i will never be but what we should be
focussing on the end result, what is the end result, what is the result and the result was reached
LC.

its not always about the end result though because there's processes that we've got in place or
systems that we've got in place

MMS:

madam, I'm killing myself here you know, I was following the processes no, even when l was to
...even when I was told to act, in fact contrary to the company interest I did try the best I could to
make them understand this is not right, in the end I complied so you can't be saying that l'm not
following processes, l am, even when it is hurtful to the company, so, I am really sorry if happen to
see things other people don't, I been following you know, its today, its since.....all you read in that
paper, what you're reading in that paper I wrote this yesterday, I wrote it yesterday but before
yesterday no-one knew, I never said, I tried as best l could to say you shouldn't be copying
passwords, its against company policy, when ....its against the company interests, the first time I
said so, my colleague told me ok, eh, don't worry you know, our servers are safe. You want to
know why I'm the only person alive that came from Harvard with 100% cyber security, it is because
I know how to break in servers and fairly easily, so relying on SSH or 50.02 for the security of the
server is a mistake, it is a mistake, there are many ways you can break into server and I happen to
know that this is why I was trying to tell them please lets not copy the password, no-one listen so
why you not emphasising this point, who is breaking the company interest here, me, or the people
who are actually acting unprofessionally, you not raising that point. I also told you about moving
from the modular approach to an integrated one, so as you are a coder yourself, so we're moving
from object to spaghetti code, its not right

DM:

so at that point there, so to bring the conversation back to something else, you're talking there
about your current task which we've run down on that document there, the assertion of the team
including Claire is that that task should have taken you 3 days and it has not

MMS: yeah
DM:

explain why

MMS: yeah and as I said the code is there, the first time I wrote the configuration for 22 VPC's and this is
more than 1000 lines of code which is right there and which is working, it took me a few days,
which very few people would be able to manage
OM:

I didn't ask you to break it down

MMS:

no no, once again I will give you explanation, that was first day, so what I had to move as I said,
from this modular approach to the fact where I had to have everything in a single file, that was not
an easy task and it was also risky, so every single step I was taking I was even during my own work, I
was trying first of all, because when you're using Terraform you can destroy the infrastructure, I

was first of all trying t be careful nt t break things an maybe you mght not kn abutthat
but I've been building many digital tools t actually help me improve the pross t make sure
nothing isbroken, but its not an easy task t move from the prjet designed t be objert oriented
t something looking Ile spaghetti cod is not easy, and i'm sorry t..
one mare time
DM:

you've just said something there I didn't know about, you said you created a number of digital tools
t help you with this task, what is that

MMS. really simple, when you're working with Terraform for example, when you wrote the 5224, so if
you have a given so that VPC is within a folder

DM.

right

MMS: when you're making some, if you happen to analyse the code and you see that the modification is
needed at that point, when you make that modification and once you start testing so you run
Terraform, if you haven't already done so, 52:47 so initialise the directory Ternraform to import the
52.53 resources and then Terraform blank, when you're doing that, if it is not working if it is not
working because I happen to work on the common line what most people will do is maybe open a
second folder, and just try to list all the fles with LS 52.08, ok, removing whatever need to be
removed, and start over again, that process was automated so when l'm writing Terraform plan,
when it is failing the logs are stored somewhere and then all these files are deleted so that l can restart all over again, by doing that l was saving quite a lot of time. in terms of how these files are
written, the first time I managed to write these 22 VPC's in such a record time, it is because Zoe
and Claire can attest to that, l actually happen to have written some code that is able to generate
some Terraform 5343 so the first time I tried was writing some python code, I could actually write
the entire Terraform thing, it was too complex I didn't have enough time so I wrote something that
is able to generate the code block by block, this is why these blocks are so robust and this is why all
of them are working
so all I'm trying to
make you
and the first time I even mentioned
that idea in the team, I recall and she said so in very good faith, she's someone very nice, I have to
insist on that, but Zoe told me, this is overkill, ok, understood the point so, I skip down the beat
my ambitions but most of the task I have been doing the reason why none of this code is failing, it
is robust, its working, its because I happen to have built while people were sleeping, some tools to
actually get rid of all these little step of action you taking here and there and at the end of the day
which will give you an hour or two, so what l'm trying to make you aware of is, in everything I've
been doing, my first, myself maybe its likely to arrive at something but my first aim, was first of all
not to be a disappointment to my manager first and secondly, having the company interest at
heart. When I had some reserve about things I tried to speak a bit I was listened, I was told to do
things that way, most likely hurtful to the interests of the company, I tried, I was not listened to so l
complied, so I cannot be told I'm not complying you know pushing code, as often as the others, no,
the end result is there you know and in terms of coding, someone coding is someone using his
brain, my brain
Maybe this is the case that my brain might not be that you want, the same as
other people, maybe this is just the case, its not a crime, you should be looking at end result
DM:

you just created a tool though to spit out Terraform on a fly which is against the strategy of the
business, we asked you to make yaml, you put it into a pipeline
3 days work

MMS: thank you very much, so this tool I told you about
OM:

rather than doing the took the team would have preferred you to actually finish the task

MMS: ok and this is what I'm telling yu, as 4 wasjust saying, when t wasworiing during the day, during
the day working fik everyone else, during the night and this is nut a crime one more time, Tm
tying t work on this kind of digital tol, s again use t atally alerate my work that's all r'm
trying t say here
DM.

we're not contestingthat, although I do worry working all day and all night on a regular basis is not
good for you

MMS: 1know, I know but.n this point you know what, 'm not going t even argue on that poit,
you're rght but they are two things here, to be precise the first thing is and Claire is aware of that,
early this year.LC.

just take your time

DM.

we understand

LC:

if you need to take a moment, take a moment

MMS.

early this year, I happen to have lost one of my uncde.....----

LC:

do you want to take a couple of minutes are you alright

MMS: no its ok
LC:

are you sure

MMS:

so, he was like a second father to me to be frank so since he passed away it has gotten sometimes
I'm not able to sleep at night so instead of staying like, being alone, like just staring at the wall, I
was just trying to be productive, working day and night and believe me its not a big issue to me like
when 1 really like something I'm doing I just don't count the hours, so I know regular people maybe
they need to change the code once and then think again but no I do have that strange ability to
look at the code, try to make the modification in my head and then as soon as I write something it
is working, it might sound unusual but this is me, also during the night as I say, since early this year I
can't sleep at night most of the time, but its ok, even when things are ok I don't sleep much, 3-4
hours a night since time and memorial so instead of just staring at the wall thinking about the
relative I've lost I just try to make my time
my time useful, where I am extremely frustrated
about this interview we having right now, I'm being told I can't be using Github, the repository is
there, you can use Github and see what happen, I'm being told you are not checking in code as
often as the others, I am not the others but the thing is whatever I've been checking in, is working,
I'm being told you're not complying, when for every single task I was given because of the
education I have and also because of experience, I say maybe we shouldn't be doing that, that
might hurt our interests
.1 was not listened to, I was told do it in that way, which I did so in the
end the question I'm asking is what am I being blamed for

OM:

so again we're not specifically calling out anything to do with the first task, we're calling out the
VPC task, Its still not complete, even though the people in your team believe they could complete
that task in 3 days, the rest of your team and Claire are concerned at the number of times they
have to redirect your focus on to a task and its still isn't changing

MMS:

ok

talking and in fe in general, when we're tailing about things we need to stik to fats, right so,
someone unable t use Github will not be able to 0100:39 WIll naot be able t

DOM:

m

thats not the accusation, that's not the nem that we have, that's not the thing that
trying to
get across to you, its not the diking on the button, it's the fundamental methodology of writing
ode as part of a team

MMS:. ok
DM.

as part of a group

MMS: ok, as!said.
DOM

inaudible

MMS.

as l said, l'm very happy you actually saying that because as I've been repeating quite a few times,
since we started.......we also need, we can't put the focus .... if we are thinking in good faith,
which is something very important for everyone, we should be looking at the motivation of the
person, the result obtained and so on, now as l've told you, 1'm sorry for thinking differently you
know, maybe in my next life I'll try to be like everyone else that's one, and secondly what l'm trying
to say concerning the telephone bit, if you go on a cloud rule on line, or even AWS documentation
it is not recommended to use telephone to actually import these things and make sure whatever
you're writing is identical to what you trying to do, to outline, when you're doing that as soon as
someone would change something on line you need to do the same thing here, when I started,
when I was given that task for AWS, the first thing I did was using the AWS 01.01:55 to query AWS,
against attributes of the PVC's and we build them from scratch, Claire told me no this is not the
right approach, use Terraform in codes, so as someone you know who care about the efficiency of
what he's doing, every single VPC was treated as an individual project, every single of them is fully
operational as well, when ! did that I was told no, all the files should be merged together which is
this is what I'm insisting because it's a bit of a challenge because originally the way I designed the
whole thing was to be modular, so moving from modules to fully integrated
what you call
spaghetti code its not
as I've been insisting with
with one error, one mistake something
not done right I could have destroyed everything 01.02.59

DM:

ok so the challenge is rather than continue on a path that was wrong, why didn't you start again
and complete it in the 3 days, why are you pushing a boulder up a hill when we don't want it

MMS:

ok, you cannot say 01:03:14 don't want, because when I started that, when I was told to write the
configuration for the VPC's no-one told me that we shouldn't be using modular approach

DM:

but at the time that I'm suggesting you should have changed track, you did know, Claire told you
that that was not right architecturally, so my challenge again is why were you spending weeks
.

M MS:

because to me

DM:

something we don't want

MNS: no no its not doing somethmg yu don't want l will disagree with you one more time, because l had
the des living in individ ual folders, so his de this configuration was designed t five in
so as twas tasked t merge all of them, this is what twas doing but 1 was tying to mere
them, and t insist on that without breaking everything on AW5, that's all I was trying t do and it
takes time because you need to be careful, wouldn't you know, ifl
today if! hadn't
been careful, maybe we'd be here because of some sort of gross misconduct in the sense that I
could have broken everything, would that have been better

03
3353

DOM.

sorry why would you have broken everything, you're not worang directly on five

MMS: well, when t'mn trying to you understand is when you using...with the aunt the I think it was
014-38 set up to work on AWS with that acount, with the account have and the permission t
have, and taking into account I was using Terrafor import to work, one stupid mistake out of
tiredness or so on could have broken the VPCs
DM.

if you had pushed the

introduction?

MMS:

no no, because when you are....once you have the..ok, !see your point here, on Azure, what
we have is we have, I think we have 3 different environments, we have staging, and test staging
and introduction, . on AWS there is no such thing......so everything is there, actually before I
joined, no-one was taking care of it and even Claire insisted on it, so the admin account, the
account on which l am working, unfortunately with that account and without due care,
unfortunately I could have broken something
because what you see, when you take all the
VPC's we have, most of them are live, live production stuff, you need to be a bit more careful, and
regarding the VPC's I have to insist one more time, I happen to be a cloud solution architect, AWS is
recommended to do it in a modular fashion, I was asked to do it like all integrated and I have to
repeat myself like maybe the migration from module to all integrated, there were many problems
with variables.....and so on an so, this is why last week when I had the meeting with Claire I
showed her the result of the refactoring and its working better now, so last Thursday when we had
that meeting, at no time, not on Thursday last week and at no time before that I was being told
that what I'm doing is wrong or
no, at no time that happen no, I was never invited to a
meeting where I was told your work is rubbish or
no, it never happen, during the meeting
every day I was never told that
so what I'm trying to make you understand
.1 am insisting
on that, at no point, during the past 7 months, I was told that your performing below parr, last
Friday when they had that meeting, when I showed her the new strategy I was following which
01:07:15 unfortunately to re-write absolutely everything from scratch again and then start to
merge the pieces 2 by 2 up to we get to a single file, she was pretty satisfied with that and I recall
the last thing she even said was ok this time, this approach seems to be producing the right result,
so, you know I hope that in a few days in a week that will be fine that was I think Thursday morning
and on Thursday afternoon I'm getting an email saying that I'm performing below parr so as you
tend to insist on logic, can you explain me the logic of that

DM:

so are you saying we didn't have a formal sit down, where you're explicit with your team.....

MMS:

it never happen

DM:

but you have had messages from Claire explaining that the approach you're doing is wrong,
explaining that you should

MMS:

ok and the good thing is

just let me fnsh sorry,

something that doesn't exist

so you're disputing that there's been

MMS. I'm very muh disputing that because I have a screenshot of all our work exchanges

and have you had kind of like explanations maybe one to one sessions

MMS:. we've never had a one to one session, never

or with like other colleagues have you felt that they've had to raise concerns with the way that you
work, anything like that

MMS: you know, the colleagues as I said, the times we work together are.....we all talk together is
during the day .....in our daily meeting of 3.30 or whenever I was maybe do something.....with Zoe,
or when we need to do something together these were they only times but beyond that, l've never
had a one to one session where I was told you are an absolute, you know what you're doing is an
absolute catastrophe, you know and I insist Thursday last week when she saw the new approach I
was following which was on Github, it was refactoring the whole thing because it was becoming to
stressful to handle all these variable parts 01:09:24 and then starting to merge bit by bit, once she
saw it she was satisfied that was on Thursday morning, there was no reprimand there was no
complaint she was even laughing, I remember distinctly and on Thursday afternoon, I'm getting this
letter, this is why I say it was a goddamn shock
LC:

and have you felt that you've received, you know repeated explanations on teams chats from the
team and the team
regarding the systems, how they should be used and how they should be
used to allow the team to collaborate is that something you've experienced

MMS: what is the definition of collaboration
collaboration first of alt necessitates 2 things, first of all
we need to be a minimum
working week, which is the case except for the one person I
mentioned who is very violent in his language, very often yeah but obviously at this point, we've
spent more than an hour trying to ask me to think like other people when I'm not other people, but
yeah obviously collaboration is having a minimum of respect for the people you're working with
and not Claire, not Zoe, not even Jason and all the other, no-one is disrespectful its not.........
LC:

can I just quickly chip in Marcel so one of the points that was raised to myself was in relation to the
current task where you're identifying all the AWS resources, so, it was raised that when you were
doing this Zoe had to highlight issues with the structure, with the version being used and with the
state file worked, is that something you can recall

MMS:

yeah, I remember distinctly that, so what happen is, when I started to write the .....configuration for
AWS, what I did was in good faith using the latest version ofTerraform, so I was using
1 used
the latest version of Terraform to write configuration for all of them, and when I did that, and when
I was done with it, I shared the work with Zoe for her to give me
to say what she thinks about
that and when I did so, she told me that its ok, obviously its working, but she said maybe it would
be a better idea to use an older version and she recommended we use the version 1.3.7, so this is
when I moved from the latest version and I had to actually rewrite the configuration on1.3.7 and

Page 19of41-5T

this is one of the repasitry.
but before that yes, J wrote everything using the latest version of
iTenraform. Latest version of Tenraform whih t me makes sense
C:

ok

DM:

Sorry, why does that make sense, because this is an important part of how we've ended up here,
why does that make sense

MMS: ok, today as you say today when we take for example Python whih is a regular common
programme in language, script and language, if you have to write some script today, unless you
trying to refactor some old script that will read that way, written in the old days, when you go
online it is recommended to use version 3, version 3 of python, not to use 2.7, so for Terrafor is
the same, the version 13.7 when l was asked to write the configuration, I took the latest version
which l think is 1.4. something, so in my mind there is 1.4. then there is some other version, 5 and
6 and so on but l was using basically the 1.4 version so this is what l used, so when I said latest, it
was not actually latest, latest it was 14
it

DM:

the latest.01:13.11

MMS:

yeah

DM:

but my reaction and everyone else's reaction that works in this business, we do understand that
you're not an individual you're not working for yourself, you're not working at a start up, its not a
green field, of product, there's already Terraform and ansible in....state, you're...my challenge
to you is your immediate question should have been what is the version for this team

MMS:

100%

OM:

why would you immediately go off and use a brand new version which might not be backwards
compatible with what's in production

MMS:

no there was no backward compatibility left in the system because .....

OM:

it doesn't matter
you weren't thinking
as a team, you're thinking as an individual

MMS:

sorry, I'm just speaking like an intelligent person, sorry, because we have two clouds here, we have
Azure and we have AWS, these are two separate entities, agree, its not the same product. Zoe has
been working for a long time for Arnold Clark and she's using the version 1.3.7 and since that time
they've been using version 1.3.7 and that version 1.3.7 what I know, there are even some
vulnerabilities because of the age, it start to show its age, so I was asked to write
.

OM:

these are standard things in every company, immediately you should be thinking how do I fit into
the company, not

MMS:

this is what l did, I was asked ....on AWS there was zero configuration, zero there was nothing,
when I came in there was absolutely nothing, it was there but there was zero configuration
so
when I was asked to write the configuration for the VPC's obviously instead of using an outdated
version which is 1.3.7,1 just write
it Just make sense to me to use a version that is at least a bit
more recent, this is 0j14/55 no-one had patched the AWS before, no-one, so it was just living
there that's all

that's the way you're not thinking, you're not thinking

o. do

DOM:

but we have Tenaform

MMS. no there was zero Tenrafor, ok,
DM.

there is Tenafonm in the business

MMS:

no no no l'mn talking about the AWS what l was asked to do

DM.

T'm talking about the Terraform in the company

MMS:

ok, me, Im talking about Tenraform for the doud I was asked to work on, there was nothing

DM.

ok, do you see a problem in having AWS on the latest version and some other tool on a different
version, can you see how that adds to the workload that we're trying to avoid

MMS.

ok, to the risk of repeating myself again, Zoe and the others, they've been working because Arnold
Clark is using primarily Azure, and they've been using Azure for a long time so obviously as they've
been using ..... .when they started to work on Azure the version 13.7 was most likely the..one
of the latest versions and they started to work on it, and obviously as they've started in the past,
over time, if they were to change the version too suddenly, unfortunately as we said it would
create some backward compatibility issues but when I came on AWS as I have said, there was
absolutely nothing. I was just told write some Terraform configurations for AWS, so in my mind in
my world, as AWS anyway, it's a separate cloud, separate company's, separate entity I thought to
myself, ok lets use a version that it at least a bit recent, not using an ancient version, but when I did
so, she understood the thinking, but when she asked me to rewrite using the old version, I did it but
I don't see the problem in .......for a brand new cloud for a cloud about which maybe the expression
is not right but you get the idea, for something no-one had patched before, I don't see also the
sense in using an ancient version to deliver something that is starting now, that ancient version is
presenting some vulnerabilities, so that's why l'm trying to have a balanced approach and use
something in the middle so I went for the 1.4, that's what I did, there was nothing unexpected
there was zero there was nothing

OM:

I really struggle to understand how someone with your experience who's worked in a number of
different company's, who would think its ok to start having multiple versions in an estate and
doesn't see the added complications and risks that brings to the department

MMS:

when we talking about.......-

DM:

any bank, any other technology company, any retail business would insist there is a specific version
on any technology exclusively

MMS:

but now the question I'm gonna ask you is when I asked to work on the AWS, can you show me
company policy or something that is specifically saying you shouldn't use any recent version, use
only the ancient one, there's none. Was I
when I started was I told that, these are two
separate products, two separate companies and the sort of activities, we're doing on Azure, are not
the same, the sort of activities we doing on AWS, did anyone came and said ok because we're using
1.3.7 on one which is a version which as you're talking about risk management the 1.3.7 is coming
in some vulnerabilities so I was asked to work on AWS, someone with my experience what do you
do, as I say we'll try to balance the risk so its it a bad idea for a cloud that was completely
untouched, is it a bad idea to try to use a version that is @1g.51 to avoid the same vulnerabilities

oming fram the very ancient version
this s the
fmn asting,
said there was
meeting where was speafially told no you shouldn't use the 14, there isno company polity
saying that and lets keep in mind one thing, one factor that s very important,we're talking about
the multimillion pound company that suffered a massive cyber breach in Deember that isputting
its
at risk, its business at risk, its reputation at risk, so in suh a situation you are asked to
write some Terraform on the doui for doud provider -one
no has touched before, what would
common sense recommend, try to Limit the risk and this is precisely what I did again
of13.7,

question

as

l

n

ustamer

DM:

by going ahead and doing a thing without consulting or collaborating with anyone else

MMS: nono
DM:

in my experience anyone in your level would immediately ask for what is the version that I should
be using, what tools do we currently use, what is our working process, it feels like what you
described was you decided what we should be doing

MMS:

no no l didn't decide anything

DM:

you decided well you just said you..--.

MMS: when l started to work on AWS I was told and people in the team are very often joking about that
_some people used to joke, they will basically say that no-one cares too much about 01:20:18 so
as a stepping stone for you just go and sort of play with it all we need now is to make sure we have
some Terraform that is working. and I don't see one more time and I have to challenge you on that
too, I don't see one more time, what is the issue for something that was unchartered, unpatched,
there is no company policy, there is no company,....-...... you're talking about banks, I used to work
for NCR, at NCR there is a specific company policy telling you that as we are using ancient servers
and ancient technologies try to limit the evolution of versions, so for such a thing, use that version,
there is no such policy here, we just came out from a cyber breach so, in my mind as I said I was
just told just make sure it works, that's the only instruction I was given
LC:

who gave you that instruction can you recall

MMS:

sorry

LC:

who gave you that instruction, can you recall

MMS:

no no, everything I've been doing it was Claire who told me, so Claire told me just write the
configuration

LC:

So Claire kind of said like regardless of how you do it just write it

MMS:

yeah, no she just
yes she told me write the configuration .......I wasn't told specifically use
version 1...no, I wasn't told that and as l said you're talking about risks but when we're talking
about risk we need to be very open minded, its very important, if the older version 1.3.7 it is
opening a lot of vulnerability we just got hacked, so, don't you think it makes sense to sort of bring
your balance in your approach and pick something in the middle of that, that's what I did, I was not
given any other instruction

LC:

I think it terms of if you've got concerns with a version that we're using, that's your responsibility to
approach management in relation to that rather than taking it upon yourself

MMS. nonlwasn't Awas
A/have t msistyou know, when we had that meeting A have to insist
you inow, she is the manager, you inow, Claire s the manager, t can't talk for her if you see what t
mean, l wasjust told that one is unchartered territory no-one cares about it, so we have zero
Terraform configurati ons, we want some configura tions as you mentioned someone with my
experience will try t balance the risk, wll try t use something not very latest version beause this
s also unchartered territo ry but using something to old is also not good for the company
LC.

Marcel do you mind if we just take a really small break, I've got a scheduled meeting at 3.30 just so
1 can cancel it to continue s that alright, just rterally 5 minutes and Ill call you bak in

Adjourned:

Reconvened:
LC:

just sol don't have someone else coming in

MMS. the other point l was trying to emphasise here was the fact that.when l joined .._actually the
cyber attack on the company happened a few days after l join, in the first days unfortunately it's a
very serious situation everyone was stressed it was hopeless, Claire 01:23:
23 so as l wanted to help
a bit, I came to Claire and I told her, I said ok as I do have some experience in 01:23:32 do you think
it would be helpful for me to look at the sort of holes, digital holes our company might have left
online that might be used at the moment to compromise more and more systems, herself and
David Moffat they both say ok but just don't spend too much on it, lets.......just bring something you
can bring in 2 hours.......I still have my work email here, if you want I can show you ......{ showed her
all the systems that were exposed oniine, some of them had you know, some of them were very
outdated and were exposed online, I gave them a list of more than 200 email addresses that were
available by the user available online, people like will push email addresses online, without even
realising, so what..........when I gave them that list we actually had a little talk about that they saw
the list of emails these hackers could have compromised, we got the list of systems that were not
supposed to be available online but that were, what that little experience did emphasise was the
fact that unfortunately for
to have a balanced cyber security approach there are three things
you need, you need the people, Arnold Clark has the people, you need the processes and the
technology, for the email addresses of regular employees or senior managers, or for critical
systems to be available online and not behind the VPN but to be running outdated system what I
want to emphasise to you is the fact that unfortunately in terms of processes there were some
weaknesses and now when from the first day, as I said I help to notice things like that and I'm asked
to write the configuration, for a cloud no-one has touched, you can understand maybe from my
point of view the reason why I wouldn't go for the latest version because this is absolutely silly
because we don't know the weaknesses of it but you wouldn't go for a very old version .....this is
against the basic of professional is above and when you know a minimum about cyber security so I
accept the fact that some company's might be using some old version to write software and there
are reasons for that but unfortunately when you're using outdated version very old versions unless
you are a bank and running some 01:26:14 somewhere behind a firewall, which we were not doing,
you don't do that, so, based on all these bits and pieces, I have to apologise for this but once again
you are talking to someone who happened to have an extensive knowledge of cyber security so
that's why I was given
1 was given zero requirement, the company has no policy in that regard
so it was the best effort it would have necessitated to first of all think in terms of modules, which I
did, and also try to evolve using something outdated to further expose the company, that's all I did,
this was not, I didn't decide on no
we were in a period of chaos
it was complete chaos,
Claire herself no matter what we might think, she's a human being after all, so she needed to take

Page 23 of41-5T

189

are of herself and her family, she's taling care of us as a tam, she was attending all these meetings
so, in the midst of this chaos, you can understand if {'ve and obviously the company have some
weakness in some processes and technology lets fate rt at least.
so there was no pofiy, I was
asked to work somewhere no-one has worked before so someone with a very basicknowledge of
cyber security would not go for an old version, you are exposing again, the company and thar's how
l was thinking
LC.

ok and there was just a couple of questions I just wanted to ask in terms of the kind of main tools,
so you've said like the focus of the arc ops team the main tols used are Terraform and ansible
which are industry standard tools, so, how do you feel in general your performance is with those
tools

MMS: if you want to challenge the performance of someone on a given tool, we need to be actually
seeing that.we need to see actually the result of that person using these tools, I started to work
here since December and since December as I said I've been trying to, there are many
pieces..there are many scripts of Terraform configurations I've pushed on Github, so, someone

---so for all.so the gentleman here is insisting on the fact I should be pushing 5 times a day,
no this is wrong you know because when we go, when we study IT for the people who study T, in
IT we don't learn just about the technology, there is one part of IT we call you know human
interaction direction the aim of human interaction direction is to study the interaction between the
man and the machine but in order to study that interaction we also need to study the person itself
and people are different you cannot expect all of them to react in the same fashion, its like and you
are a programmer yourself .......the way you write code, your favourite language is yours, its not
mine you see what I mean, so you cannot expect me to write code the same way you do, you
cannot expect me to break down the problem the same way you do, you cannot expect me to write
the same algorithm as you, but what we should be challenged on is the end result now the Github
is there, I've been able to push code !'ve been able to retrieve code, the ansible the only time I was
asked to work the ansible project I was first asked to work as I mention, you join a company, you
happen to have a very heavy background in yber security, ok, and you're asked to rebuild the
server in the midst of a cyber attack, what do you do

DM:

lets get back to the point in hand, how do you rate your Terraforming ansible skills, the challenge
that we have is that Claire and the team think that you don't have a high level of knowledge on......

MMS: I can't rate myself
LC:

.

sorry to interrupt, you can't rate yourself if you have individuals saying that they feel that your skills
with that isn't up to scratch, what would you say to that

MMS: ok, as you said, it's a feeling, unfortunately

unfortunately someone unskilled on Terraform,
someone who understand absolutely nothing on Terraform will not be able to write Terraform
configurations for 20 PVC's that is working, its not logical, its not possible so we need to search for
a problem somewhere else and as I've killed myself trying to explain, when you design a system
because
I was given no requirement, what I was just trying to follow, maybe I need to show
you that the solution architect
1 got, was delivered on 6/5/23, but prior to that I was working on
that you know, I work for Arnold Clark ok, maybe ........maybe after what happen in December
maybe in my work I need to have the company interest at heart and I may need to follow the best
known processes, AWS is the owner of their own cloud and a cloud guru is a massive company of
0
1:3135 all these people say don't use Terraform import yet we do it, its fine no problem, all these
people say when you're writing Terraform for an infrastructure that is supposed to grow over time,
this is another programme we are talking about, even though Arnold Clark is not using AWS

massively the usage of it will grow over time, so as the ursage will grw over time, and for people
Iike us who studied IT, at a minimum, whih kmd of structure would yu chose spaghetti cde
or modular this is the question I'm asking, no T've been told that people in my team, some people
and t don't know who, its not important are saying that 1 know nothing of eraform, its fine, if I
know nothing..DM:

Nobody's saying that

LCc:

1don't think that they're saying you know nothing, its just that the information that I got from your
manager was that that feeling was that your competencies with these tools were limited

MMS:

ok

LC:

so, its just to get your perception of that

MMS: as I've said.all I have to say is someone with a limited ability in that area, is someone who
doesn't know it well, someone who doesn't know it well would be unable to produce a result, on
Github you have the 22 folders with the 22 VPC's every single of them is working perfectly so what
kind of incompetence is that
DM:

so, we're not talking about incompetence, we're talking about the level that you are at, versus the
level that we believed you should be at. so, my question to you, to narrow it down to help us get
helpful answers, is your experience of Terraform and Ansible more than just AWS training and
01:33:24 training, do you have explicit commercial experience of extending what you learnt, the
suspicion that the team have is that your knowledge is purely down to online Aline training

MMS: ok so, the answer l'll give to you regarding that is, before coming to work at NCR, right before
coming working here, I was working for 01:33:51 in France for about a year and before that l was
working for NCR in Edinburgh, when I was asked to send a copy of my passport and everything l
also sent a copy of my work certificate, you know, my manager at NCR is Donald 01:34:08 on the
paper you have their number and their email address I worked there for 4 years, ok, and NCR is
using both google cloud which I do have certification on and I was also working as .... .in that regard
there and also using AWS, so that's cool, on the job. As we were working on infrastructure I need
to insist on that, that is supposed to grow over time, you make it modular, and this is exactly what I
did and this is
these 22 VPC's are there, they are working so if they are working, we can at least
assume the fact that the basic is there, now why did individual went that route, there was no
requirement so he acted in what he thought was the best approach, and the best approach told on
the job and in other places is making things modular, you said you're a programmer yourself, so I
don't need to insist too much on that so this is what I think, I have to insist, Terraform import is a
very dangerous tool, on AWS there is no staging on AWS for Arnold Clark, there is no staging, there
is no
staging production, its older and most of them are being active and need to be careful
and this is why 1 was taking and merging files where some variables were repeated in more than
one file or where some resources had the same name, you have 22 of them, every single of them
has elaborate, maybe 20-30 variables plus resources, .... you do the math, and I needed to make
sure all of that goes well together to avoid breaking things, that's what I did
so if someone is
telling me that he thinks or he feels that my performance is not right, I mean this is a matter of
opinion, I can't judge but lets judge the result,
LC:

so would you dispute like if someone was saying that they feel that

MMS:

the facts are disputing it

C:

what f'm saying, if someone is saying that they feel yur mpetnies with these tubs are limited,
would you disagree with that

MMS: don't need.
Ihave to formately its recorded, so, 4 think you've listened to me for mre
than an hour you already know my opinion, as l say l wouldn't tale anyone's feeling into account
because I'm not saying that its not important no, for a matter related t techno logy lets stick
to the facts, lets stick to what is there, and what is there is working, so whether t am the best
Tenraform programmer in the worid or the worst, the approach l hose is the one recommended by
the kind of study we took and also by the doud provider and it is working
DM:

so the position on that statement from Claire is that it wasn't working when she wrote that
statement but you're now saying it is, so when did it start working

MMS: no its all working, do you want to see it
DM:

no no so if it's a dispute it's a dispute l just want to understand there is a dispute, the position that
we have is that it didn't work as of 2 days ago, and you're saying it does work

MMS:

can ! have a piece of paper please I'll draw a diagram, I think its important

Paper passed to MMS

MMS: ok so, maybe I can just take out my laptop too I think maybe its better I take........(gets laptop out
bag- unzipping can be heard).......then I'll show you, so, on the ......if you want l can send it to you
by email and what you've just say, maybe it does explain all the problems we're having in here, the
first approach I did is, and when you go on the ............I'm going to open it and show it to you
-....when I did it in the modular fashion, with 22 separate folders, in every single of these folders it
is working perfectly and last week I have to insist on that, I did show that and the first time it
started to work was back in March, I think way before May when I first
all the problem we
have is I did it in a modular fashion
DM:

but why modular when they're all inter-dependent

MMS: sorry
DM:

they're inter-dependent, they have dependencies

MMS:

no no no these are
we're talking about VPC's.......that we need not to get, let me switch on my
computer and see that ·........VPC's are like AWS, you can
they are like some sort of
you
know, lets call them villains, you know these are isolated
networks and within these networks
you can do all your magic or whatever and you can decide whether or not you want to expose this
service to the rest of the world if you want, but these are isolated entities, within these entities you
have many things, you have .......inside a VPC you have a gateway, sometime you have a
router,
you have some routing tables and all these things are they concern only this individual VPC, these
are, ·.....VPC's are in the design of them they are isolated units and this is why, and interdependency is within it, so the routing table or internet gateway within the VPC are closely linked
and that really bringing to mind an Interesting story, two of them these VPC's for some reason are
massive, they are massive and I recall this time to Claire and the others laughing at me when twas
complaining about how massive they are, these massive VPC's the level of inter-dependence was
so high and the number of components was so great that regarding this one,

so,tp keep going bad on track

MMS: ok
DOM:

nobody on your team thinks that that design was logical, no
one m your team thinks

MMS: ok, no-one
DM:.iswhat they would do
MMS: ok
DM:

so why did you go there

MMS: land for the 6 time since we started to talk I was given no requirement, so acted to the best of
my knowledge and I come from a world, you said it yourself and its being recorded, you working as
a programmer and programmers tend to do things in a modular fashion, that's all I did, so if they
don't see that as logical, -OM:

those individual components,

MMS: those individual VP"s.......
DM:

they're going to be Terraformed and put through a pipeline they're inter-connected in some way
are they not

MMS:

sorry l missed what...........

DM:

they have dependencies, so that it's a Terraformed pipeline process that we're putting in place

MMS:

uh huh

DM:

there is inter-dependencies........that's why we asked you to put it back together again

MMS:

and I was doing it but the wrong way

OM:

why did you put it back together why not just bin it all and start again and be done in 72 hours

MMS:

well, first of all, as I said its not
the question I'm gonna ask you then because I'm going to
reverse the question ......is it a professional mistake to have first of all followed the best approach,
the recommended approach and then when you've been told that you need to merge all of them,
is it a crime to try to use them and take these files and try to resolve the conflict and try to merger,
is it, is it, because you need to tell me that clear, do you consider that completely stupid, a sign of
incompetence because it is ok, please state it clearly because I don't see where you're going here

DM:

I don't understand the thought process

MMS:

the thought process is a modular approach

MMS: I think you have the wrong appreciation of what academic and professional means because what
you need to know, sir, is everything you're doing in the professional world, anything your
programming your computer, anything you're doing in this word is directly coming from the
academic world, the two are linked if you have a poor academic understanding unfortunately the
technology the way you will use technology and what you will be doing will also be wrong so you
can't disjoint these things, the academic world and the professional worid are linked, one is the
consequence of the other you can't disjoint them, this is wrong, this is not the right way of thinking
DM:

we're again going down a route which suggests the problems we're having with you working in a
team

MMS: let me ask you a question here, why are you not saying anything about the fact I went for the
modular approach in the first place, why don't you talk about that because you ..-OM:

I am talking about that

MMS:

the story didn't start......I'm sorry the story didn't start when I tried to merge, the story start
when I was told to do something proper about it and I followed the industry standard which is
modular, why don't you comment on that, because the story didn't start when I started to merge

DM:

with the greatest of respect I've commented on it

MMS:

and to me, you're not..I'm sorry to say that sir, you are not acting in good faith, it seems to me
you treat me like an idiot, this is how I feel now, and this is not right, you went to school just like
me, you most likely have a degree, I mean for gods sake, what did you learn at university, when
you're building your software project you do it in a modular fashion isn't that what you learned at
school or not, that's one, secondly these are individual projects, ok if you want to put that within a
continuous integration in the pipeline you know what, all you had to do, will be to write and
individual configuration for ever single of them, which is not rocket science, so what are you talking
about, are you trying to make me,
are you telling to me, who is because, don't get me wrong, I
am most likely older than you, I've been working for longer than you, are you telling to me, that
when you're having a software project you shouldn't use a modular approach, because lets talk
about that because I'm getting tired of ...if your aim is to make me look stupid, please state it
clearly or if I was wrong to do it in a modular fashion state it clearly but you're going in cycle, what
you doing right now, can you write it
if you want write it on a piece of paper, Mr Sangare
Mory-Marcel is an idiot because he treat me like one, sorry

DM:

no-one is suggesting that

MMS:

sorry,

DM:

no-one is suggesting that

MM5S: 'mn talking, Mr Sangare Mory
Marcel s an idiot, he doesn't ±now what he's ding, worst yet, when
he's asked to do something without requirement, he dares using a modular approach, write it on a
piece of paper and Sets go to urt, please write it on a piece of because Tm tired, Im sorry,
I've been talking for 2 hours,
LC.

think David's just trying t understand the thought process as to why you've done that

MMS: I've answered the question that will be the 8 time, since we started to talk, 've answered the
question, so if Mr David here does not understand the modular approach in software engineering,
then we have another problem. So all I'm saying is l'm tired to repeat that over and over again,
someone who went to school and is at the minimum qualified when he's asked to deal with a
software project he does it in the modular fashion, if I did it wrong, please write it on a piece of
paper and lets go to court with that, within the court you will demonstrate the fat that I've not
been following the right approach, that's all l'm saying.because I'm tired, you treat me like an
idiot and you shouldn't be doing that, you are not the judge, you are not a solicitor you're just
another engineer just like me but you treat me like an idiot, I'm not one, you treat me like an idiot,
DM:

no-one would .-----...

MMS:

now ifit is because you want to dismiss me, please do so, please do so, and lets meet again in
court, because what you're doing here its an insult my intelligence, sorry, you went to school, you
most likely have a degree, you are a handsome man, intelligent on top of that, you're way of talking
shows it, why are you trying to make me look like an idiot, why are you doing that

DM:

I'm not trying to........

MMS:

this is what you're doing sir, when you're writing a software, when you're working on software
project, sorry to repeat that to you again, I use the modular approach and that's what I did and in
terms of the pipeline, don't worry, you will write an individual pipeline configuration for every
single of them and you know why you want to do that because today we have 22 VPC's tomorrow
we might have 100, then next day you might have 1000, and then when you keep them separated
the individual programmes won't affect each other, let me tell you another thing, which is not clear
to you because you work in software engineering, maybe your background networking is not good,
I have to tell you this, when
these are individual VPC's
putting them in a single file is a risk,
let me tell you why
because with one mistake or one wrong doing you destroy all of Arnold
Clark on AWS, the company suffered a cyber attack, we are barely recovered from that and you're
asking me to go against the recommendation of Amazon to go against the basic of computer
science and do things in a unified way, I was doing it and its not easy and while doing it I have to
insist on that, I was trying not to mess up things so if I acted wrongly and I'm tired to repeat myself
again, because as I told you l'm a human being, first of all you're trying to make me look like an
idiot because you're telling me no, you should be thinking like others, no, I am not you, and I will
never be lets be clear on that so you can't ask me to think like you and as a matter of fact, at first
you thought I was an idiot, I've just demonstrated that I don't know who you are but I most likely
have many more qualifications than you in many more areas, you want to bet

DM.

so again

MMS: so, s, yu came t me, you first of all tell me nao, why you doing it inthe modular fashion, if you
don't know that you nerd t gp bad to school, or f yu think its wrong you write it an a piece of
paper and we go to court or lets make itsimple
DM:

an}help you, I would Eike to help you

MMS: no, don't need your help thank you, or if it is about dismissing me for something I haven't done
wrong, please lets go ahead but let me make it dear, at no point and the ode is there, the
email is there, I have been trying to at against the interests of Amold Clark, and please stop
playing with my mind that's what you doing and this is not right, you first of all you ask me to
be you, !'m not you, and !don't want to be and I will never be.that's one, secondly, what ! did
wrong, I chose...l didn't choose the latest version because this is a security risk for gods sake,
l'm supposed to be a heavyweight in cyber security, I was given no requirement so I didn't want to
use an old version, it's a security risk for Amold dark, we just come out from a yber breach, I
wouldn't use the latest one because its too new, I did something in the middle. In all of the schools
in the world, people are being told that, so, if what I heard if what I learnt at the university of Paris,
or Harvard university or Oxford university is wrong please lets make it short, !'m tired. 1am
stressed, you know, you treating me like an idiot which is ok but don't try to play me on that, and
the statement you just made about the academic work and professional work be careful you might
not know what you're talking about and for someone who just show you he's got7 degrees, there
might be some things you don't know, you need to know that the shirt you're wearing, the badge
you have, the glasses you have and all these things, even the vaccination you received as a child are
a direct consequence of the academic work there's no disjoint between the two of them, so I'm just
showing you here the basics of software engineering, and if you're telling me that this is wrong
please fire me for that and lets meet in court and talk about it, because that's it, 8" time in a row
you know, why you doing it in a modular fashion, you're a software engineer you should know
DM:

Again, l'm asking you specific questions about

.

MMS:

and l gave you specific answers

DM:

no you actually............my assertion is you're giving me generic general answers .......-.

MMS:

this is your opinion,

DM:

its not my opinion,

MMS: ok so write it on a piece of
you know what because I've answered your question, you know,
you are treating me here like a criminal, the way you started, the way you started, when you asked
me to think like everyone else, who do you think you are to ask me to be like everyone else, I can't
be everyone else
DM:

you continue to say that but that wasn't the assertion

MMS:

no this is precisely what

DM:

Iwas asking you to think in a certain way, l'm asking you to work as a team

LC:

work in a team

MM5: 4workimn a tam that's wty we meeting every day, I work mna team, that's why when I'm stuk l'm
talking to Zoe or to Claire herself and you inow what, the logs on teams, what do you think, do you
think that since «join on 6/12/22 they were leavmg me alone, we're having a team meeting every
single day, haw can you say I'rn not working with the team, l can take my Microsoft teams here and
show you, I can show you right now, every day we talk, now Tm sorry for the past uple of weels I
was heavily focused on getting this bnt done t move to something else and ! was very focused on
my job, is it a rime or should 1 stp being focused on my job and start talking about offee or
house or car, no, I have a job to do, you're talking about my role at Arnold Clark, Arnold Clark is
paying me to work and when my work is not mplet I feel bad about it, so i was working for the
past couple of weeks and heavly so, if it is a rime please write it on a piece of paper, lets go t
court because you are not in our team, how can you even state or even imply that someone who is
working remotely and who is having a daly meeting session with his team is not working in a team,
how can you prove that, and you're going to try to make me an old man like me, make me think
that this is right, this is wrong, where are you going with that
LC:

I think the concern is that by not following the processes

MMS:

I've been following the process. if twas not following the process

LC:

if you can just let me finish in terms of the processes that the other team are following then
there's an impact on the ability for the team to work collaboratively, that's the concern

MMS: ok this concer is wrong, let me tell you why, its wrong because first of all l'm the only one working
on AWS, that's one, secondly the work l'm doing on AWS is in no way a dependency for anyone
else's work, so thirdly, as I've repeated myself quite a few times, we have a daily session for 30
minutes or more where we talk about our programmes, what we're doing and while we're doing
some chit chat and in the meantime when I get stuck I have no hesitation annoying Claire or Zoe
about it and Microsoft teams can attest to it so when you say that I don't work in a team what do
you imply,
OM:

your submission there proves that you don't work as a team

MMS:

ok this is a statement and that what l'm saying if what you're saying is true, please write it on a
piece of......because you know I'm getting frustrated here for 2 hours you've been treating me,
actually lets get to the point, I'm going to get you one step back to prove that
because
......even the point from which you start to make your reasoning is wrong, for a programmer, its
wrong, you should be starting from the start, if I was not working collaboratively why is it that I
even managed to get to this level when I been working here for 8 months can you explain that, you
can't, secondly, every day we have a team meeting

OM:

working in a team is more than turning up to meetings

MMS:

ok so can you write the details on a piece of paper so that I can talk in front of someone who is
acting in good faith, or in front of the court, lets make it simple, because you don't know where
you're going here

OM:

I don't understand how

.

MMS: no you don't, you don't and I think
DM:

I don't understand how you don't understand what a team is

MMS: ok, no, yu don't inow what a tam and if you want l can explain to you but what ypu domg
here isnot right, you are biased you are heavily biased first of all you trying t impress me by telling
me that you started t de at 10, I did the same thing, and you want t inow something else, 1 can
tell you something else, my mother used t work for NASA you see and.
i
s,

DOM:

none of these things are relevant

MMS. no no because you were trying to impress me there
DM:

no-one was trying to impress you, I was trying to explain to you

MMS.

no, I see what you were trying to do

DM.

you put in your email HR professional I'm not an HR professional

MMS.

we have the same history

DM.

yes

MMS: we have the same history, so congratulations I hear you started to work early
LC:

1think that was David's point when he was saying about the coding that he understands your
background

MMS: secondly when you are doing things lets start with that what is wrong with doing things in the
modular fashion, you are an engineer, you're not answering the question and when I ask you that
question you jump, no no you don't know what a team is,
OM:

no

MMS:

Madam, you know, I feel I've never had any one to one with my boss Claire where I was told that I
was doing anything wrong

LC:

ok

MMS:

the last time we had a meeting she was pretty satisfied with the job I did and she even told me, ok
now that we find that methodology is working lets get it done and move on, that was on Thursday
morning, on Thursday afternoon l'm getting a letter saying l'm incompetent, while in fact every
single step I've been taking was done in the interest of the company, so, I think its recorded here,
you have my email I have been you know, I'm sorry the gentleman here is not a court prosecutor
and he needs to understand one little thing which is not clear to him, instead of treating me like a
criminal because this is where he started his argument from, you can tell from his body language
and everything, he should have started to understand things from an objective point of view, this is
not what he's doing, so, if
.lets make it clear, I was never told that I'm doing anything wrong,
l've got a screenshot of all the teams discussion with my boss, so, if the point is about telling me
Marcel leave your laptop and your key, I have been answering your questions since Thursday, what
you're doing here is harassment, I'm going to be clear about it

LC:

how is it harassment

MMS:

I'm being put in a corner for no good reason and I feel stressed about it, so,

LC.

i understand it's a stressful situation however the purpose of the meeting is for me t get your
perception of our cancers

MM5. you know it might, it might not be intentional, even that needs to be proven but honestly since !
started to work, first of all I'm being told you don't know what ansible is, do you know what Github
is, all the Github is there, you go and have a look, its all there, now, on Thursday morning ! had zero
remarks from my manager, on Thursday aftemoon 1'mn being told that l'm being incompetent for 7
months when the facts prove otherwise so, I've answered all your questions since Thursday, I'm
extremely stressed, I'm extremely tired and you don't seem to realise that you know I'm just a
regular person Ike you, I'm not superman
LC.

no,

MMS: since Thursday, try you have my letter there, you have the fact, when you analyse all of this you
can see there are gaps, I mean lets not play, this
is
--

LC.

of course and l acknowledge this is a stressful situation and the purpose of this meeting is to give
yourself the opportunity to put...

MMS:

t'm sorry this gentleman here is heavily biased, I've never seen anything like it, he's heavily biased
so whatever he's saying he should write it on a piece of paper, and lets go towards lets go and
call someone who is you know who is less biased who want to analyse things for what they are. In
software engineering one of the basic principals is to break down problems in modules this is what
ldo,

LC:.

ok so you're saying in terms of that specific task

MMS:

and it is working and just now you were telling me that she said its not working, thankfully
last.....everytime I have some screenshots to prove that ........l might even have recorded that on
this laptop I don't know I will see, but the 22 /PC's are working, they've been working for 2
months, was just trying to merge them and in terms of ........in terms of result or achievement
...its working, I'm just trying to put all of them in a single file without breaking things because we
have 01.59:12 what is not clear with that

LC:

so the concern that I obviously want to discuss with yourself in relation to that was because it was
brought to my attention that this task should take 3 days and there's still not a result so are you
disputing that, are you saying that there is a result and it is working

MMS:

the result as I say the result is there and it is working, and the aim
when you're writing
terraform, when you're writing some terraform configurations madam, maybe I need to explain to
you what terraform is, so basically you know, whatever digital asset we have on the cloud, we use
terraform to be in a position to rebuild this asset quickly that's all it is, so on AWS we have one class
of assets which are private networks so the task was to write the terraform configuration for these
private networks, I did it in the modular fashion, for every single of them, it is working and this is
what l need to ........its not a matter of.....on an individual basis it was not working and when we
merge them, its not working no, and on the other hand please you know since Thursday its too
much pressure on me, I've got other problems in other areas, it has not affected my work, no-one
has known, I have always acted to the best of my knowledge, my abilities, my qualifications and my
experience and the gentleman here who was trying to ask me if
what people do at NCR, NCR
Edinburgh is ......you know as I said get in touch with them, you know, NCR is mostly hosting digital

Page 33t41-5T
Laura C/June 2023/Continued Employment Meeting with Mory-Marcel Sangare - 20-06-23

199

services for banks mostly and in there, believe me nf you are being told t work on a software
project and you don't get started with a modular approah you could get fired fr that, that would
show that you are incompetent, full stop. And that's all {'ve been trying to do this is the basic of
software engineering and if its not clear 1 don't know what to do here, same for the bash sriptI
wrote would you believe it,the company suffered a massive cyber attack and to be frank let me tell
you how l felt when that happened, I felt bad because I was thinking t myself oh my god l've just
joined a group and that group is getting haded, I hope they not gonna dose down because of
something like that so l tried to contribute the best l could, for someone who took his two direct
bosses, Claire and David, to show them within 2 hours the email address that were most likely
compromised, A have it on my teams here, the systems that are exposed on line that shouldn't have
been, would you want someone Hike that someone I feel that first of all, he's showing you that
he's got a rather advance knowledge of cyber security whether we like it or not, his qualifications
are showing it, so a person like that is asked to build a server, is building a full blown system to
generate password, automatically is being told its wrong and its my fault ._I'm being told to
write the configuration, I have the proof of it, it is working, I did it in a modular fashion ..its wrong,
what is expected, lets make is simple because we're getting lost in the details here and even to be
frank, I'm the one being asked question in here but given the question you asked believe me there
are some weaknesses in that, that's why l'm saying simple, write on a piece of paper please that
doing things in the modular fashion is wrong therefore Mr Sangare Mory-Marcel has shown his
incompetency and lets go to court with that and see what happens or are you asking me to push
code every .2....5 times a day, I wish I could, my brain is not like other people unfortunately but
the thing is you can tell me if you use the Github log you can see every single bit of code and Claire
even said that herself once, the code Marcel is writing, people might say what they want but its
working it is working so, someone is writing some code that is working, how would you rate his
abilities, at the very least he knows what he's doing, at the very least, he might not be the best but
he knows what he's doing, it is working and guess what he did it by keeping the interests of the
company at heart, that's all
LC:

ok and !think in terms of.........can l just clarify this is the current task isn't it

DM:

yeah

LC:

yeah so, I think the concern is what we've said to you before, its not the end result that's
specifically the concern, so, in terms of this process from the information from Claire, she said that
there was an initial concern that arose when you first attempted to try and script the creation of
the Terraform

MMS: yeah
LC:

which you were course corrected is that right

MMS:

no as I said, you know, go to any software engineer, in software engineering there is something
called code generator, so what is a code generator, it is something you use to generate some code
to make it easy, you know in Terraform we writing, it's a configuration file and this configuration
file it has some building blocks so for example in the Terraform configuration for a given VPC you're
going to find an internet gateway, which is some sort of router, ok, the internet gateway we're
talking about whether it is in this VPC, this one or any other the structure of it will most likely be
the same so as the structure of it is most likely the same, therefore you can write the function that
will do that work for you, by doing that you are limiting the possibility of errors, by doing that you
are writing your code faster and maybe this is the reason why I've managed to write a 1000 lines of

Page 34of41.ST
Laura C/lune 2023/Continued Employment Meeting with Mory-Marcel Sangare - 20-06.-23

200

de invery short time and its working, maybe this is the reasn why and its nt a crime think
like that
LC:

so we've gt, in terms of when you've then done this, Claire's then said hat she explained t
yourself that a VPC consisted of multiple parts that were finked and should exist and be managed
within the same fle as we could not possibly recreate a VPC without destroying all the resources,
do you disagree with that

MMS: when l was initially.laire an attest to that, I've never dis used 02
-0532 and as 1said when
was given_the first time we spoke about it,what was asked to write, configuration fle for
Tenraform and I did it to the best of my knowledge. The bit about having all of it on a single fle, I
have to insist on that, it was never ..it was never dear to me and l would have never even
imagine going into that direction because in software engineering, 02-5
-1 in software
engineering we do things in a modular fashion, also I wrote a script that is an aunting script, so
what that script does is, when you run the script it will create a textile with the date and the time,
the current date and time, so it will give to that file that name and inside it you will have all the
VP's we currently have ......Claire herself can attest to that, the number of VP's that have been
grown and will continue to grow, so when I was initially asked to work on that, for someone who
studied a bit of IT, the 02:06:43 supposed to grow, Terraform import is a dangerous too! 02.06:49
and I want to..........and when we first spoke about that, maybe she did imply to have everything in
one file but this is not what I heard, there was no written requirement, me I was told write a
configuration and I did it, following the industry best practices, lets keep that in mind and I did it
following the best practices of software engineering so now, if someone is coming to me and telling
me look, why ..........how have you managed to merge all of that in 3 days, this is an estimation, just
go and take the same task and do it in 3 days and lets see, and if you manage to do it in 3 days,
congratulations but again we're talking about you, am I you, no l am not, second point here, you
know the argument that would start from that.........what you merge, this is wrong and this is not
acting in good faith, when you acting on good faith you start from the get go, what's the
requirement, zero, did you, in your actions, did you follow the best practices, yes I did, did it work,
it is working so what am I .....what is it you wish
LC:

again, I don't think the concern is the end result, the concern in terms of this task is you were
course corrected twice and then when you then done another attempt your colleague Zoe had to
highlight issues with the structure, the version and the state file, and then you then had to speak
with Claire, where she had to go over it with yourself and then she advised that she then had to go
over again on a catch up. So I think the concern is like, the amount of times you're having to be
kind of course corrected or given instruction

MMS:

ok, I can explain that too, the first time they complained because I was following the industry best
practices, why is that we are not talking about that first for a company that just came out from a
cyber breach, lets talk about that first why are we not mentioning that first, secondly the second
time I was asked, the second time I had to rewrite things, the second attempt, it was when I
unfortunately tried to use a balanced approach, not using an old version because of the security
risk to the company itself, also not using something that is too new that is foolish, I choose the
middle approach, no this is also a professional fault, ok no problem, when I rewrote it in 1.3.71
have to say as the initial thing was done because the approach I've been following from the
beginning and this is how I've always done Terraform, I have to apologise for that but I've always
done it in the modular fashion, so when I was asked to rewrite using the new version, what ! did
and Claire agreed with that, this is in our daily session, I told her ok ) cannot rewrite everything in
one go, with these VPC's its suicide and we will never finish it, so what ! did was, writing the
configuration individually for every VPC's first, so I did it separately and then I merge it bit by bit

Page 35 of41.57
Laura C/June 2023/Continued Employment Meeting with Mory-Marcel Sangare - 20-06-23

201

until l get t one file, everyon e agreed with that, when l started t do that, unfortunate ly l as
encuntering a lot of problems because these files are massive, you ta!ling about more than a
3000 fines of code just for the configuration, we have the import files, I mean, all Tm tying t say
here and where the minimum of fairness, is required, you're talking about the regular human being
that is doing something that is pretty complex, and that he's trying whle doing it,not to break the
entire company, this also needs to be taken into acount so when l was trying t merge it which is
going against lets emphasise that, going against the industry best practices l was having
difficulty because it's a very m plex matter, am I going to be punished because I deaided to first of
all not start to write, to put everythi ng in one go because you run the risk of destroyin g everything
so doing things, the second time around doing things in Kittie part and then trying to merge this
part, a bit like the way we build a car, we build the engine separately, the wheels separately and so
on and then afterward, we sort of assemble and this is.slowly, everyone was right with that, I
have to admit it was not easy going that route, because the number of implications and so on was
extremely high but last week, and this is one point where...last week, I have again I have
managed to find a way to merge them, so acess....and it is right there on the repository, why is
it we're not talking about that and as I said, I am sorry, you know, I come from a worid where
you're working in a company, you know, your first thing is to not only do the things properly and I
can prove that......... I was not daydreaming or sleeping, no, I was redoing the thing
DM.

no-one suggested anything else

MM5S:

and I cannot be condemned because the merging process which is mathematically extremely hard
to do, I mean lets talk about....these are every file's got tens of variables and you need to merge
them into one without breaking the entire infrastructure, we also need to account for that and you
also talking about someone who got..........because you're talking about someone who while doing
this, managed to get the solution architect of AWS, so, what l'm trying to emphasise here is you
know, the proof I was doing everything I was
.1 was not only trying to make it work, and it is
working and also trying not to break things because AWS is not Azure, these are separate
programmes, AW5 I used to work for Amazon, AWS is actually, what it is, it is a cluster of.......tt is a
massive cluster of Linux version machines and they tend to behave like that so the.......... .another
thing that is maybe missed by my boss is the behaviour of AWS is not the same as Azure, on AWS,
you can destroy, you know, with one silly mistake on AWS, on these files, I could have destroyed
the entire network for Arnold Clark everywhere on the planet, if Iwas doing.........so....one..........SO
merging these files I needed to make sure it is working and secondly I needed to make sure I was
not doing anything silly. Now some people might say ok, the way you wrote it is not right, it is
working, when we take them individually it is working, so this is not the failure as such, it is the
process of merging it, which is going against the logic of Amazon which is not easy but yet, last
week after spending a lot of time trying to work on that I have managed to find ways to make it
work and I did a demonstration in front of Claire, I can tell you she was very satisfied, she said ok so
we should get the final result soon, it is on Github, I say yes very soon, and even the merging
process we went from something like 22 files I have merged them 2 by2, we got to 11 now it will
be down to 10 and this is what I did the demonstration with her, and the good thing is these files
were now in the conception of these things I went for, not the modular approach but I changed the
approach and now it is working so, I haven't done anything wrong, the first time I'm being told you
shouldn't have used that version, we 02:1453 you can't go for an old version again and again and
repeat the same mistake, this is wrong, I mean someone should be
someone who works in
IT and with my background, if I were to do that and maybe 1 should have got fired for that, this is
what t learned at least in cyber security you know you've just come from a cyber attack, you know
the consequences it has for the company and now you are given free reign to do something and
you're going to again open some vulnerabilities, you don't do that

DM:

yDu were asked t do a task within an overall e system within a department

MMS: there was no requirement it was a different system
DM:

my challenge to you was s if you understood how working in a large team works where we all
move together as one

MMS:

well, as ! said and my answer to you is, you know we working remotely so we are therefore
physically separated ok, how do we work in team, we work in team through the 02:15:51 so when
someone is stock or when I'm stuck except from as l mentioned rom one of our colleague who is
very abusive in his language and 1 tend to avoid him fortunately, but you can understand me for
that, so except for him I have no problem..Claire will tell you or even Zoe.asking them
when l'm really lost but once I know what l'm doing, I tend to start, you can check the logs, quite
early and I try to get things working so, maybe...I don't know am I being,- isita reproach on
the fat that you are too focused on your work, its not a crime, and anyway, we are anyway
physically separated so specifically because we are separated we should be trying to be a bit
serious about what we doing, so, when I am stuck yes, I'll go to Claire, when we have our meetings,
I am there, beyond that excuse me if l'm trying to......beyond that.. once l know where l'm
going, excuse me start to focus on my work, also you want me to check. so basically change the
code 5 times a day, no, no I mean l understand what you trying to say but l'm trying to merge lets
keep in mind I'm working in an environment where there is no dev environment this is kind of
production a single mistake and I destroy everything......since I merging files, I need to be
extremely focused and I need to make it work, this is what I was doing that's all, but whenever I
was stuck I would talk to people, I used a version in the middle, to me its obvious you don't go for
the latest one, you don't go for the old one, since you've just suffered a yber attack, and as l said
.maybe someone also need to take into account the fact that maybe before l raised the case, we not
expecting that, but at least in my team and I'm not being arrogant when l say so, in terms of cyber
security l am most likely the heavy weight there, so you are the heavy weight and you happen to
know the consequences of what you're doing so when you're not given requirements please you
need at least to take into account the supreme interest of the company and that's what I did, I was
not doing that
tell me, choosing that version, do you think that was malicious

OM:

no, no-one has suggested it was malicious
l'm asking questions about that was all

.it gets to the matter of the competencies though,

MMS: yeah but unfortunately you talking about competencies you've just been breached, precisely
because our processes were weak should we carry on on the same path, no, that's why I chose
something in the middle
OM:

but should we have developers doing their own thing, using

.

MMS:

I was not doing my own thing.......

LC:

I think the concern is its not

MMS:

as !said I was not doing my own thing, where are the requirements, can someone show me

LC:

its not your responsibility to make executive decisions that are outwith the processes of the
department

M1MIS: ok, its not my responsibility but when l started to work on that was l given requirements, no, J was
tld we have nothing there just go and write the configuration, that's what was tld, 1 was not
evenyou know and his is another thmng, in software engineering and 'mn not saying that to
blame Claire or anything no, lets be dear, when i started t work on that the poor woman was not
only dealing with our request as a tam but she was also and we could see that she was also taken
into different meetings ail the time so obviously she came to me and she tld me write the
configuration, there was no requirement so how do I understand that ok, do it to the best of your
knowledge and that's precisely what I did
DM:

so as an experienced engineer the first thing would be to get the requirements and understand the
problem

MMS: ok but now you asking me to
DM:

you didn't do that

MMS: you see how biased you are because now
DM:

I'm actually not biased

MMS: excuse me, my boss comes to me and she tells me we have nothing there, do something about it,
you know what it means, what it means is it's a work telling me we trust you, just make the right
decision and this is precisely what I did, so you see... but what you are saying is my boss should
come to me and say, do that and I say no Claire you don't........-........what do you want
OM:

no no

MMS:

but I did exactly what my boss told me, you need to take that into account, I mean Claire is not my
friend, she's not my friend, she's my boss so when the boss comes to you and say we have nothing
there, do it
you do it to the best of your knowledge

LC:

and to your knowledge is there standard like processes at Arnold Clark and versions that Arnold
Clark follow so in that moment did you make a decision to use something that you knew we didn't
utilise

MMS:

ok Arnold Clark is selling cars right, ok, from all the cars they are selling you have Mercedes and you
have Toyota, are the engines the same, can you expect Toyota and Mercedes or BMW to be the
same

LC:

no but I'm just asking in terms of this

MMS:

this is what I'm saying, there was nothing

LC:

so I'm asking you like in terms of that specific situation did you know that there was a standard
process that Arnold Clark used and you utilised another

MMS:

no, first of all and I have to insist on that there is no process there is no written process of
procedure to say when you're working on AWS use necessary 1.3.7 no such thing there was zero,
my boss comes to me and says there is nothing, do something about it and make it work, 1 went
and did what my boss told me, am I being blamed for that too

t.

okl think what we're best doing here Marcel s i know David's got childare and stuff that he needs
t deal with so what we'ill do is we'll take a break for today, and then will tie bak in with you for
the next uple of days and then we can come bak in and continue just I'm obviously conscious its
getting to the end of the day, David has chaldare commitments he needs t get t, so I'il get in
touch with yourself as soon as possible, we' come back and we'll continu e, is that alright, i
appreciate its obviously quite stressful

MMS.

I think, l truly believe, it is my belief, I believe that you know in terms of process as
the gentleman here seems to be very keen on process, in terms of process when you have
someone who is not performing right, you know what you do, you get him into a one to one and
tell him, its not working but you want to know wty this didn't happen, it didn't happen precisely
because you know, she could most definitely see that l was not incompetent, if people say that
merging these files will take 3 days, sir, you work in IT, you know at home, where I Iive, I've got a
cluster, so inux duster with roughly 8 tenrabite of ram and dose to 500 02:23:10 you know as I've
been doing these sort of things for a long time, for me to get the build of materials and assemble
such a thing, I would do it in less than a day and I love doing it, I've been doing it before, but if I
were to challenge anyone here do you think they would do so in less than a day, most people
would spend weeks or even months all l'm saying here is in software engineering when you are
given zero requirement I had no requirement, when you've just come out from a cyber breach,
when you happen to have a background in yber security and when you are asked to do things to
the best of your knowledge, the minimum you do is following industry best practice and this is
what I did

LC:

ok, like I said Marcel we've obviously not finished discussing everything I'm just conscious of the

MMS:

now, I have to be
this is just something I want to say you know, what is happening at least
to me, and this is not entirely clear, this is what the hard facts are showing I think it is to me its very
clear that you know, suddenly I be king of programmes and you need to get rid of me that's what I
see and we've been talking an hour and a half now and thankfully it recorded, I don't know if it is
because we still have so much to go about or if there are more
but at no time, anyone
mention anything around the behaviour programmes of Mr Jason White

LC:

I have to get to that, I have highlighted that so I will ask you that when we get to the other meeting
but that is on my list to discuss with yourself

MMS:

ok, and me, quite honestly I have to insist on that, you know, the background of the individual
needs to be taken into account, the way, the
there was no written requirement and this
and I have to insist, this is not a crime, we were in the middle of a crisis, I am even amazed and
surprised Claire could manage to remain calm despite the pressure she was under I mean we could
all see that so she comes to me and say, Marcel, we have nothing on AWS I even distinctly
remember she even said if something is broken there we might need to rebuild it by hand which is
not right, now, infrastructure on AWS tends to grow, when things tend to grow you go modular,
now what I want to say is, and I said it in my email, you know, and I'm not saying that to be
threatening or anything no, you see, it is my belief, life is too short, what l said here, is very clear, I
am not really in the mood to fight, I don't want to fight and you have no idea, the impact of what is
happening now, you know, let me tell you something on Thursday when we had the meeting, after
I showed her that this new approach is working, she even showed me and I had to take some
screenshot of that, not to be told again you haven't listened to what I say you haven't told me once
the merging process is done, the next step for you will be to make some changes, and she was
showing me on the terraform website what these changes would be so when you come out from a

meeting file that you knw, t me it looks fl ]think the only thmg as l mention, we spoke
about she said but, are you ta!ling t your cleagues, l said of curse t talk t them, everyo ne
knows that for the past 2 weels, actually for the past 1 days l was telling her i was not only busy
rewriting more than 1030 Ines a code and making it work, the cde rewrite i did it and its
working and l was really busy trying t merge these things and getting done with that once and for
all, because it was tiring even for me and l was, you see what i mean, so going from that and she
started, I remember now, she started to ate names, do you talk to Zoe, 4said oh yeah Zoe is a very
nice person you know, who would be afraid to speak to Zoe, Zoe is very nice and very open minded
even though she doesn't talk a lot but she's very open minded, Greg, a wonderful personality and
then when she cited Jason, I didn't say a word because as l said and I complain to her many times,
l'm sure you can.. maybe t'm biased I don't know, but l come from a background where you
don't overtalk your boss, or you don't interrupt your boss when he or she is talking or you're not
being, you know when you talk to people there are two things to take into account, the content of
the message and the way you say it,you know, when someone is talking every time you have the F
word put somewhere and his favourite victims the cyber security teams, oh these people are a
bunch of idiot, no they don't know what they're doing like, why all these procedures and stuff Ike
that, you know, in cyber security you have people processing technology they are not idiots they
just trying to put some processes in place and we're talking about competencies here
LC:

yeah so like l said Marcel we're not finished we will go into more detail but l'm just conscious
David's got childcare commitments so we do just need to finish up for today and l appreciate it's a
stressful situation, it continuing on but I will liaise with David and I will confirm with yourself as
soon as I can when we'll come back in, I just want to make sure we're not rushing it and like I said I
do have, I said to you at the start I'll go through the points that t have and then we'll go through
your email so, I have highlighted the concerns that you raised, so we'll go through them when we
come back in alright

MMS: one thing I have to tell you madam, ok so is like, what is happening to me right now

.

LC:

no nothing's happening

.

MMS:

no, you have to let me

please, what is happening to me right now is not easy to handle

LC:

no of course

MMS:

so like even today I tried to work but its not easy so and so please do I need to come back here
tomorrow or do you want to have a phone conversation and the way its going, the way its going
because lets be honest, with the way its going, what is the probability I'll be back in my team, its
close to zero, lets face it

LC:

I've not made any decision like I said I want to discuss everything that you've put forward as well

MMS:

but my question is do I come back tomorrow

LC:

no, don't come back tomorrow just I know you work remotely so work remotely tomorrow and I'll
be in touch tomorrow

MMS:

even and I'm not saying that
to be lazy or anything please write it down because it seems to
me everything l say is turned against me, but even right now, finding the concentration to work is
very difficult

E;

LC:

mnof purse l understand

MM5. so am! bemg so ifr'm being suspended or amythingyou know what an Ive my life
C.

n, you're not being srspended, what has happened just at the moment is, we've not finished
discussing everything that we want to discuss, fke said you've put your ema forward, its just a
time constraint at this point and ke I said, David's got childcare commitments, finishing up so I
don't want t rush anything so what l was going to do is t schedule another meeting just for us to
continue on just so you have the opportunity to go through our email in more detail and if there's
anything further that you want to put forward then that's fine, so as it stands no decision has been
made, you're still working as normal and I'll communicate with yourself.....-.

MM5:

not as normal, its very difficult

LC:

I do obviously appreciate that but l'm sure you'll appreciate from our side of things as well we want
to have the opportunity to go through everything with yourself in detail and give you the
opportunity to put forward your mitigation and just due to time constraints that's why I'm just
adjourning it today and then we'll come back in and we'll continue alright, right ok doke

MMS: and please before we go there's just one little thing l want to say before we go, I'm sorry this is
really the last thing I'm saying if you can..........you know.....our company is using two approaches
to handle digital assets, they have the cloud and we have our Datacentre, on our atacentre when
you join the company you are being given an account to the 02:32.56 server and one you are on
the 02:32:59 server then you use the route account to do whatever work you have to do, to be
frank with you, this is a colossal security risk because the route account is extremely powerful you
can do anything with that, now I know for a fact that whatever product using here as a VPN those
products do have zero 02:33:28, it might not be clear to the management but they do so the simple
fact that we don't have individual account on the servers, to our work it is
1 mean it is
something
.1 never said a word about that because as you see I didn't want to be pointed at or
something but this is a colossal security risk that needs to be sorted as soon as possible and I'm
saying that honestly, no one does that, when you're working on Linux servers everyone is working
from the route account, I mean as a linux admin, at least at NCR you'll get fired for less than that
LC:

ok

MMS:

this is what we're doing here every day now the question I want to ask and this is why l spoke
about fairness, these sort of problems, no-one sees them but then when I'm trying to work
modular it's a problem, you see this is not fair

LC:

ok, that's something we can discuss in more detail when we come back in alright

MMS:

so thank you very much

LC:

thank you very much I'll be in touch as soon as I can alright

Hi Claire

t will grve you a call tomorrow re the above however was just looking to see if you would be able to assist in
answering the below questions. | had to adjourn the meeting due to time constraints and will reconvene back on
Thursday afternoon.

in terms of the current task - Marcel put forward that he was advised that there was no requirements, no process,
wasn't specified to use a specific version etc and that is why he chose to do this in a modular fashion - is this the
case?

Regarding the current task - Marcel advised that this was up and running and was complete - is this the case?

If no specific requirements are given - what is the expectation of engineers should they query requirements/is there
standard requirements that they would always follow?

Marcel advised that he has never had any conversation/comments regarding his performance from either yourself
or concerns from his colleagues - is this the case?

Marcel advised that following on from this point, he had a conversation with yourself last Thursday where you were
satisfied with the work - is that the case?

Kind regards

In terms of the current task - Marcel put forward that he was advised that there was no
requirements, no process, wasn't specified to use a specific version etc and that is why he chose to
do this in a modular fashion - is this the case?

We use Jira as our work management system, Marcel’s original task was to catalogue all the AWS
components, so they were captured in terraform.

Since we had to correct course early when | highlighted the objective was for terraform to create the
infrastructure — not that a script should be run to capture manual changes, | decided the task was
too open ended and choose to reduce the scope of this ticket to focus on the VPCs specifically, and
to create a new one that was to just list everything we were trying to capture, so that could be split
into separate resource tickets in the future

As this ticket was split, the original description about which repo to use and that it should be the
same as our AKS structure, was left on the first one.

While the ticket did not specify the exact version to be used — Marcel had reviewed out current repo
and it was expected given his experience that he would follow the structure and versioning that was
consistent throughout (‘prior art’)

na a lat ean as

Identify all current AWS Resources

Gg Attach r PVs (oR Meu lie merits e A ett eee oc Tate Dm cele | LO)

Description

We should make sure that all AWS resources are laC using terraform (or other ansible (scripts only when not possible)

Work from a branch from the following repo

https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform - Connect your Github account

Create a new aws folder the same as we have for aks

move any existing aws related code into this folder too - like elasticsearch

There may be other pre-exisitng ansible code in other repos - if there is and it's still needed document in a readme
within this repo so we know where all the bits are and how they hang together should we need to rebuild aws resources

(I'm sure there are things like MaxScale somewhere - which will also need updated/patched)

Acceptance Criteria

Identify and list all AWS resources in all regions to be captured in terraform

Notes

Once list is produced a ticket will be created for each resource type so we can split into sepetate tickets for PRs

Regarding the current task - Marcel advised that this was up and running and was complete - is this
the case?

At one point Marcel did have resources imported and plans running, but the structure did not meet
what we were trying to achieve, there were no pipelines, there was no PR, and the branch was in no
state to be merged.

It did not meet the definition of done.

If no specific requirements are given - what is the expectation of engineers should they query
requirements/is there standard requirements that they would always follow?

We do not give or engineers step by step guides on how to complete a task, there is ample
opportunity to discuss our work.

We do have daily catchups, group chat, calls to discuss if something is or isn’t working, we don’t just
decide to change course without discussion about why.

| do expect that we work on branches and commit our code — to facilitate discussions on the work
and to make sure if there was any holidays/medical issues etc someone else would be able to pick up
and continue.

| do not expect to have to open a PR myself on someone else’s work after having asked repeated
times for it to be done.

| do expect that the sole work of 3 days is more than 3 lines changed.

Marcel advised that he has never had any conversation/comments regarding his performance from
either yourself or concerns from his colleagues - is this the case?

While | did not have a formal 1-2-1 to discuss performance, | did on numerous occasions point out
that things were not being committed or were not as expected leading to course corrections
throughout the task.

Colleagues may not have mentioned anything to Marcel in person, but concerns were raised to me
that certain discussions that took place previously had to be repeated as they had not been taken on
board.

remember to push your work to your branch &

Ley
Please remember to push your local commits to git it's good practice to push at a minimum at the end of the day, if you
were off sick for example someone could pick up where you left off

Marcel Sangare 19/05 11:0
Good morning Claire.Sorry you are absolutely right.It is just me and my silly habit of pushing only what appears to be the
best...bad habits die hard but something | do need to rectify indeed. i was trying t make the comments as consistent as
possible. | am just finishing the vpc_accounting script that will be pushed today as well

so on the branch “INFRA-675/AWS", under “aws”, there will be a folder “vpc_terraform_version_1.3.7" with the update to the
terraform config for all the vpc using version 1.3.7.

9/05 11:33
why? this should all be in one folder, it’s all still in separate folders?
It should be along these lines as discussed
AWS
-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc-1.tf
-- vpc-2.tf
-- variables.tf
-- output.tf

it should be “= 1.3.7"
fs ee
and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right ©

push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that just say “Typo” ©

Marcel Sangare 19/05 11:45

yes indeed.So i first rewrote all the individual terraform configs using 1.3.7, tested them thoroughly .

the organization you mentioned above was mentioned by Zoe.i will do that next ..

iam on it now as well as the vpc accounting

Thanks! makes it so much easier to read, then we should be pretty close to that PR and getting VPCs out the way and on to
the next resource @

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an idea before i push this
afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So i am breaking them down, each of them in their
individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single folder as requested by you last week:

The reason why | initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are considered isolated units so the
idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for scalability and strict isolation from each other.

so there should only be one variables file and one outputs file - these are going to be the same inputs and outputs across all
VPCs - this is why pushing to git helps - then | can pull the branch and look at the code and discuss it rather than looking at

some file names on a screenshot

UY ETc BS re-set crea)

yes indeed...it will be as you mentioned below:

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc-1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

so there will be a single main.tf a single variables.tf and a single output.tf

But in order to make this easier, i am breaking the individual configs along these lines before merging into a single folder

ie Pee

most of the variables will be in your files to start with anyway as it's not a module so it's defined in the code

we don't need things isolated, | get the original idea - but we want to be able to run a pipeline across them all - check for
changes etc - no manual running of anything

23/05 15:28

yeah I'm guessing you'll have no outputs or variables, so you'll only need the main.tf and the file with the VPC and all it's
settings

it'll be much tider and easier to understand

once that's done and everything is imported and there's no changes in the plans, it will be easier to make a module and pass
Tamme)

ro ® 8 @

Marcel Sangare 23/05 15:29
yes this is why i am breaking it down for each of them and theen use the broken down files to bukid a single configuration

OK r just keep remembering to commit - doesn't matter if it's not working or not ‘beautiful’ © | was so used to working
alone that | had that habit too ©} now | do tiny changes and push all day &

Marcel Sangare 23/05 15:3

i swear....i Il push the “broken down” configs every day

if not i must dmaned and not allowed to use linux anymore

Can you also remember in addition to pushing changes to git - you also need to pull changes from master into your branch to
keep it up to date please &

you will be OK as no one else ts working in the area you are at moment - but if we don't do it elsewhere we would get really
bad merge conflicts to resolve.

Marcel Sangare 30/05 13

Sorry Claire...believe me when i say that i was thinking about this this morning. OK i just wrote a little script of 10 lines that
will take care of that so that i cannot forget no matter what...i now completed the incorporation of the changes from master

Marcel advised that following on from this point, he had a conversation with yourself last Thursday
where you were satisfied with the work - is that the case?

Again after Marcel had not followed what was asked and discussed — we followed up with another
call

@ RO Elcom
J

| think i did misinterpret this comment from you the last time we had a chat about the terraform for the vpc:

SD Calle

CeO eee
This si why i was going that route
but what is finally asked is pretty straightforward

and will be done by tomorrow i think...i am already on it

No worries, | did follow that up on a catchup and actually make the changes to show you and said we had no variables or
outputs at this time, | dragged a dropped the file into the folder, | thought you realised that the variables and outputs would
just be empty or even non existent. As long as we're on the right page now 4

That's why draft PRs are good and we can discuss what's happening c-)

@ yes indeed we are and this way is even easier ®

 

(This referred to my initial “along these lines” structure, which was discussed on a call after and then
again on the 23 about not requiring the outputs/variables at this point as we wanted to ‘keep it
simple’.)

HI Claire.1 was wondering for what time tomorrow you would like to book some time to review what we spoke about today ?
am just about to upload that version too on git and send you the link in advance

many thanks in advance

branch dedicated to AWS, we have the following :

-The path to the version with all the terraform configs under one folder

https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform/tree/INFRA-675/AWS/aws/vpc terraform version 1.3.7/all-configs-in-one

-The path to the version with all the terraform configs using modules (work in progress)

https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform/tree/INFRA-675/AWS/aws/vpc terraform version 1.3.7/all-vpc-terraform

Was looking into the random VPC that were in places that we didn't know about, they are default ones (says yes under default
in the UI ) they are managed differently with terraform
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/default vpc

we can look through all this tmw

@ Claire Thomson

we can look through all this tmw

eee eee Um ee ele

I've popped half an hour in tmw morning, got a few things on my calendar, so can start there and catch up again later if we
need

@ Good morning Claire.Can i call you now ?

 

And at this point | was satisfied that the changes Marcel was making to his previous work were going
in the correct direction now. The folder structure still did have to change as did the VPC resources to
Default VPC resources, but we were still a long way from being done.

M5-- Just give me one send.

(- No its ok takeyour time.
M5-So the first point that I wanted to raise because after the discussion we had here._
C-Uh huh.
MS-fern l don't know Ljust to make sure I was not just losing it or just saying some nonsense 1 did refer
to some of my yu know formeryou know University you know graduates...
LC--Uh huh
MS-I did spoke to 2 of my former Managers and ! spoke to some friends and mostly most of them work in
(0227) you know engineering, developers and so on..
LC- Uh huh.
MS - They're doctors and so on. So the first point I wanted to repeat again and clarify and I think it is very
important, you see Dev-ops people are people who are working as both developers and this is the first point
developers and they're working as both developers and people of the ops team so they need to have you
know operation and skills and they need to be able to write code
LC - Uh huh.
MS -- Someone who is writing code is akin to someone who is writing a book you know and there are many
types of book writers, some book writers will just if given 8 hours to write a book will spend 6-7 hours just
sharpening the structure and the points they want to raise in the book and spend the last hour just pulling
these things altogether.
LC- Uh huh.
MS -- Some writers will just start to write straight away.
LC- Uh huh.
MS - Now the repository we're using the Github repository we are using it is like a book in which we're
writing right and you basically have generally speaking 3 main states, 1 state where the number of lines
you're writing are increasing...
LC- Uh huh.
MS - Another state where they are decreasing and the first state where obviously they remain similar
somehow.
LC- Uh huh.
MS - So the first day when you start working in the morning the repository in which your working alright it is
in a state I can call (0
3.56) alright at the end of the day it is (400) for the sake of simplification if we say that
Page2 of23-FM

222

the (04
3)±s equal t 3 and {4.
p4)is equal t 5 you an basicall y say that it's just for the sake of simplification
you can basically see that awe've gt 2 Jines that gt added.
C- Uh huh.

MS - No t go mathema tically speaking to go fram 3 to S there are many ways t do it, yu can do 3+1+1
so that will be 2 (04.23) that gets you t 5.
LC--Uh huh.
MS - You can d0 3+05+05 +0.5 4 times that will get you to 5 too that ame t 4 (04.32) or you can do 3+2
and it will get y0u to 5.
LC-Uh huh.
MS- And what l wanted to say is when l was told.and what l'm mostly doing is you know when I'm working
during the day l tend to do 3+2 because I was talking to my former Managers who lend me the words for that
they said recorder repository should be considered as shrine. There are some people who are throwing some
stuff into it and rectifying it over time but there are some other people who are making sure every single bit
of code they're pushing is working and commented and fine and this is precisely what l've been doing, every
single line of code I've been pushing on the Github repository of the company is fully working and operational
because when I finished writing I tested on my machine so that's one point l wanted to raise.
LC- Ok
MS - So I spoke to people around me just to make sure I was not losing my sense and two of my former
Managers told me it's perfectly fine and maybe this is how you should be explaining it so that's why I'm just
using their words here.
LC- Ok.
MS - The second point I wanted to raise is the point of consistency and equality and treatment and while I'm
talking about that when ! first joined this company here Arnold Clark I have to insist on that..
LC - Uh huh.
MS - You know that was not the...it was not the only company I was (05.53) with it was not even the one
paying the most to be honest, I was also selected with Ryman the administration company but I have to be
very clear about it, from the job interview I had the gentleman who called me from HR for the recruitment
we first went through the CV, I forget his name but I really liked him over the phone. The discussion I had
with Claire and David to be frank when you look and no matter what happens or no matter what was said
when you look at David and Claire when you simply look at their faces it tells you a lot about who they are,
what kind of person they are and that was the main reason why I decided to come in here. But nonetheless
when I joined when I was first given access to the data centre here the first thing I noticed was the fact that
once your given access to the (06.46) server, from the (06.46) server the procedure we have you are given,
you work as a route account and you need to please write it down its very important, everyone works as a
route account. In terms of managing (07.00) infrastructure this is something extremely bad, this is something
extremely bad and to the counsel I spoke before coming, as I said one of them is (07.10) you know I work in
an environment where this simple fact will guarantee your dismissal on the spot.
LC- What will? Sorry just to clarify what will?

AS - /prking from the rout aumt, everything you do is done from the route aunt berause with the
route acunt the slightest mista le you make cld have catastrophic conseq uences, worst yet. Even though
the company has zested a lot of money
protecting netwo rks if same sort of yber threat were to
manage to slip int, get int you inow the data centre just beause we tend run everything as route
aun t that cul} have catastrophr conseq uences in no time. Now l saw that from the first second was
into

shown the whole thing but Tm going t tell you one thing out of not only respet for the people woriing
here, out of the fat that technological perfection does not exist you know . didn't see it as1 know it's a
massivesecurity risk to be frank but I didn't jump on the bak of anyone t tell them that you know they are
not respecting the shrine they're not into the shrine of techno logical perfectio n therefore they do not know
how to use (8.13) because on Monday l was told that ! don't inow how to use Github because I commit,
excuse my French, the impertinence of making sure every single bit of ode l push in there is beautifully
written, fully functional before pushing it in there. So what l want to say is as l was brought to this table, it's
a question and I don't need an answer now, as l was brought to this table for interrogation I do hope that for
the sake of equality and consiste nt in treatment, the people who did allow the route account to be used by
all users on our back and also be brought to the table and asked the same kind of questions because I can't
be the only one, this is one thing. The second thing l also want to talk about is erm the third point l want to
raise is when l joined er on the day erm a few days after l joined, and mentioned that on Monday, the
company was suffering a yber attack and you can ask my Manager Claire about that, I felt awful about this,
why? Because before joining in here in my area in (0931) you know I was talking to one of my neighbours to
whom I said "Do you know what I start working for Amold lark." so when he saw that on the news and he
came to me and said Oh Marcel the cyber security expert, you start working for Amold Clark and they get
hacked." he was basically taking you know laughing at me which I can understand.
LC-Uh huh.
MS - So I shared that anecdote with my Manager if she remembers and then on the second and during that
time I send a message to my Manager Claire Thomson and also our big boss Mr David Moffat, what I told
them I said "Please, please I know I was not hired for that but I happen to have that experience, would you
please just give me the authorisation to just look on the open internet, the public internet and find possible
entry point these cyber criminals might have used into our network?" I was given 2 hours, within an hour I
gave them a list of more than 200 email addresses that were available online, so that would be used to
sending some (10.37)gave the lP address and names of all the sisters that were supposed to be on the you
know available from within our own network here but that were exposed online and I also told them how
to...which tool and how to use it to get the list (10.59) for every single of these systems. But then the question
I want to ask too is you know the company got hacked not because people in here are negligent this is not
the feeling I've had up until now but yet it happened. And the question I also want to know for the sake of
you know consistency and fairness of treatment was anyone brought to the same table right now because it
happened? I don't need to know but this is a question that needs to be answered and I'm asking these
questions because as I said everything I've done is online you know I took some screenshots of everything
because the project I was asked to work on. For the sake of simplification one more time you see at home
you have an internet connection most likely most of us do so you have home where you have your own
network, your own Wi-Fi and password, your neighbours are in the same situation they have their own
network and Wi-Fi and password and so on. If all of us here in the UK whether directly or indirectly are
customers of BT so BT has in fact for every single of us the configuration for all our routers. You know the
home routers we have BT does have the configuration for every single of them but let me tell you one thing,
do you think BT would put all this configuration into the same file and use that same file to manage all of us
in the UK? If they were to do so one mistake might destroy the internet configuration for the entire country
with (12.
36) consequences that might ensue and l'm taking that example to make you understand why when
I was given the job to do and I have to insist on that, when Claire gave me that task to start working on AWS
I have to insist AWS is like a Ferrari if you're not careful enough you might kill someone you know you're
going to press the wrong button the car would just go on its own and with the speed and power its got might
hurt someone or something. So this is why this is out of this principal of(13/10) that l went, I first of all made
Page 40f23-FM

224

sure that everything is
own flder because we can't manage all of them at the same tire and the reason
why l ased the version somewhere in the middle was berause the version 13.7 whih we use on Asia, that
version is not supported as of non, its gpt massive unreliability's. We have a service security team here you
can ask them. If you g and tadie it on the darknet for example you can buy some exploit related to these
things for $1, with conseq uences that can have. So that was the third point I wanted to raise. The fourth
point and that most iely introduce the problem with Mr Jason White is after this happened I had a meeting
with Claire and David after the tittle you know investigation oniine to find possible entry pots for these
people that were annoyi ng us and I told them l said "Please one more time, I know most Eiely this is none of
my prerogatives but as I happen to have some experience in it would you mind if 1 submit to your attention
a projet that will consist of._beca use at Amold dark here you know we have two ways of doing things, we
have the loud so you have Asia AWS is the one l know and you have our data centre. So for all the internet
traffic coming on into to server it is going through a system called (14
.39) is used for to load, balance the
traffit most of the time but it is used to direct the traffic towa rds such or such server. Now the great thing
with (14.52) is if a hacker is sending some (14.55) by default drops these packets (14
.58) but in all companies
including Amazon for whom I used to work and all my previous employers you know (15.06) you also use
your (15.08) as some sort of (15.09) so basically any bit of traffc coming in and out of your (15.13) is analysed
and any threat is you know there is an attempt for any threat to be blocked from there first. So I explained
to David and Claire that l wanted to examine the possibility of having the firewall installed on the (15.31) and
also two tools, one called (15.33) is basically a tool you use to detect any...because when someone wants to
attack you he needs to scan your infrastructure first of all, there is no way out of that. So with (15.46) we
will have the possibility from the (15
52) to detect any intrusion attempt, so anyone trying to scan our
infrastructure will catch him from here. But on top of that our (16.01) is running on (1603) and you know I
know our company invested a lot of money into some firewall offered by Cisco or Fortinet but I will tell you
one thing the firewall you find on Fortinet and Cisco is exactly the same firewall you find in the (16.19) system
so I told them that they could also run some firewall rules on this one and block a lot of bad traffic from this
point so basically building some sort of defence. They agreed on that and they thought I should be..I recall
distinctly that Claire even had spent some time thinking about the question. So during a team meeting, the
next team meeting she did announce the fact that herself and David spoke about that and I have to mention
that the simple fact the two of them took the time to listen to that idea, I have to be honest I did like it a lot
you know i was not doing it for fame, I was not doing it for money, it was just for the sake of the company
I'm working for. And during the next team meeting where Claire announced the ...she openly said that they
had a discussion with David and they were trying to see to think of the possibility of putting on (17.15) some
means to detect bad traffic and also stop it using the (17.24) firewall. Mr Jason White burst youknow he
became extremely angry as stated and I remember his words in the most you know the tone was brutal you
know as the man himself to be ...and I'm sorry but you know this is what it is, the tone was brutal and he
started to shout "We will not put a firewall on the (17.49) and everyone was quiet. The question I want to
know is this is...! don't know what you think about that but that simple action this is gross misconduct, you
can't... he is not the head of our team Claire is the one calling the shots, who gave you the possibility to even
behave like that. And you know what he spent hours, he spent many minutes arguing around that basically
saying how stupid it is and things like that. But let me tell you one thing, give you one reference, a few weeks
ago we had representation by the Cyber Security Team where they showed us, they gave us some details,
some insight towards the new ways of thinking in terms of cyber security at Arnold Clark and I recall the
meeting is recorded I think, there is a young lady sitting there I can't remember her name but she recorded
the meeting it is there. The gentleman speaking basically said that one thing we're trying to achieve here is
defence (18.52) so our (18.54) router would do its bit. AI! the main systems, collective systems inside our
network will also try to do their bits and also try to make sure that the end points can somehow you know
do whatever is possible. So he interrupted the meeting, he was basically shouting and saying "We will not
do that." and guess what it never happened, he is not the Manager of our team and I think this is a good
introduction to what I wanted to say.

MS - You see I don't inow how you tan say that but maybe l wuld tale the risk t say this you know l
thought_on my way in! thought a lot about that but i dun't know how risiy or how bad itis but t will none

the less say You knwmy father was African and one thing he taught mne from a very young age ishe said
"N matter where yu go in this world yu know for reasons finked t hstry or sociology or whatever yu
want you wl unfrtmately see that you know men and women are not perfectly equal, unforma tely
women tend to have a bit more diffulties in life to reah their position. And he was all the time telling me
that no matter where you go when you see a woman somewh ere no matter where you go you need to see
her as your own mother. The way you would treat and respect your own mother is the way you should be
treating and respecti ng any woman who is in this world. And he added this thing, he added the thing that.he
also said that wherever you see a woman managing to get to a certain level you know of responsibility in
soiety your respect to her needs to be double. So the first part of your respect is the respect you owe t
any woman as your mother and the second part is the fat that if you see her getting that far it is because
she has some talent so your respect needs to be doubled. To be frank with you every time he is interrupting
Claire the way he talks to her, even once he shh her when she was talking and you can tell it from my voice I
felt and I still feel extremely offended by the ways of his behaviour and Claire will tell you that Clearly 1 have
been trying to avoid Mr Jason White you know sine the very beginning, he is rude in his manners, his
wording, the way he speaks like you know it's unbelievable. Even recently, not very long ago he was talking
about... none of us needs to know about that anyway, he was talking about his work permit in the UK, actually
I was very surprised l always thought he was you know a British national but he appears not to be. And he
was basically saying...I don't even know why he was saying that but he was basically saying I got my work
permit because of I think Mr Collins he said and I am sure he is now regretting that. What is the meaning of
this? What is the meaning of this? So you disrespect you co-workers, you treat them like idiots, every time
they will try to say or do something you will stop it with force when in fact.and you can hear it from me
talking he is far from being the strongest in the team like even in terms of character. But as I told you my
boss is a woman and as an African person my respect to her is doubled so therefore in front of her you know
in front of her I would never..once after meeting l you know...the first time he reacted this way I had a
meeting with her right afterwards where l told her that you know I have a lot of resentment towards his
sheer rudeness, I've never seen anything like it And after that meeting l even recall having told my daughter
that if she were to marry someone like him I would disown her on the spot and I was not kidding when I said
that. You know rudeness is one of the worst you know defects in life and these guys are just like that, and I
am happy it's recorded you know he is...I don't know what to say. So last week...to get to the point, last week
when I had that session with Claire the initial aim of the session was for Claire to show me you know how I
can much more easily merge these files we were talking about these configuration files. And when she got
to the meeting on the Thursday morning I think it was erm before the start of the meeting I told her I said
"Claire there is one thing I want to say is l've re-worked the configurations and now the merging of them is
way more easier and I'm going to tell you why. On Monday when we were here you know during the meeting
I was told that l shouldn't waste time building some tools on the side to make my work and ! disagree with
that. I work as a Dev-ops Engineer. The role of the Dev-ops is precisely (24.4) of whatever he can and this
is precisely what I was doing. If you check our repository online the Github we have you will see that the first
version of the configuration took I think about a couple of weeks to write. But before the meeting with Claire
the re-writing of all the configuration we've you know a stronger structure in terms of variable naming
because my main problem was coming from the first time I was trying to merge. It took I think a couple of
days and do you want to know why it went so quickly? It was not just a matter of experience no it was all
these little tools that have been on the side that gave me the ability actually to redo the (24.44) faster. And
I have to tell you one thing you know whatever task of configuration writing I would have been given
afterwards they've gone just as quickly because the tools I'm writing basically is you know when you need to
write a configuration you go on to a website, you get the template and you fill it up yourself and no matter
what we think that part is (25.10) what l've been...the little tools I have on the side are basically you know
automating that for you so if you want to rebuild for example an internet Gateway the main structure will be
there, the system will ask you the question you need to answer to give some prompt, once you answer this
prompt this part of the thing is added to the configuration so this is one thing I needed to say.

LC-Uh huh.
MS- Maybe to introdue about t came tad t get bak to a few points I iurgot to mention iast time and
also to
the problem of the
of this gentleman. And during
meeting with Caire l
rerall distinctly
day before
meetingenm she was asting questions about erm the issues I was having
with the merging process and as is customa ry with him you know he interrupted her one more time which l
find I don't know maybe my education is to traditional or something but this is unthinkable t me that's
why it's a nem,
he interrupted her and said you inow with a very condescending voite you know
characteristi c of the individua l saying Mate you know we simply ask you to do a simply opy and paste,who
asked for your opinion? she is the Manager of the team,
is the one t make
kind of remarks, who
asked for your opinion and why do you allow yourself to interrupt her? So when daire asked me during our
last meeting she said "Are you talking your
1 say am talking them." she said
1said
Of course 1 am talking Zoe." Zoe has
a lovely personality and she is one of those ladies I was telling

LC- Uh huh.
MS - How many women we encounter out there. Same for Greig, great sense of humour and all the others
but when she came to Jason White l remain silent because as l wrote there I have been trying very hard
avoid the guy---

to

LC - Uh huh.
MS - Too rude, too brutal.
LC - And in terms of obviously you've put forward that you feel that the way that you know he acts erm
you've kind of said like how you've you know come out shaken and upset and things like that. Are you able
to like just so that you've got something with your work that you maybe need assistance with can you go to
you know Claire and Zoe, so you don't necessarily need to go to him so you can have other options yeah?
MS-Absolutely, absolutely and Claire and Zoe will tell you and even Greig when I have some problem I have
no problem whatsoever asking them.
LC - Yeah. And have you spoke to Claire just about your concerns with Jason, is that a conversation you've
had with her?
MS - After the first time he distinctly said "We" so he speaks in the name of everyone else "We will not be
implementing the firewall rules."
LC - Uh huh.
MS- Right after that meeting I told Claire that I need to talk to her.
LC - Ok.
MS-And I told her that I dislike very much his manner or the lack of it I would say.
LC- Ok.
MS - Now she ... after the meeting I understood that you know I listened carefully to what she had to say and
I thought to myself after admitting ... ! thought to myself ok I've raised my concern I'll stop right there as I
know the individual and I see him during almost every meeting calling the cyber security team his favourite

victins with the f vardwhich l would not even raise. in one sentence you have {7a43) the f word so you
know with all of that yu will errs me but t have been trying very hard t avoid hmm because he has no
respertfor anyone.
LC - Ok And are you finding that if you are Wike avoiding hmm as such that your still able to. because you've
gt other lleapyres, you've got your Manager, if you've got cnems you can go with them?
M5-l understand that, I have no problem with Greig
-Ok
MS-mean Greig's aware and Claire herself despite being sitting here tday, how can you have issues with
them they are easy going people?
LC- Ok, so you feel that your able to approach them yeah?
MS - Absolutely.
LC- Ok
MS - And my teams, on Microsoft Teams I cannot test them because I [29.22)
LC - Ok, no that's good that your able to approach other colleagues And there was just another few points
t just wanted to go through, I know we've kind of like spoken through a bit yesterday.
MS -- Yes.
LC - And ! just kind of wanted to ask yourself you've put in it just obviously due to the meeting you've been
in a state of distress where you had an accident without consequences, I just wanted to tie in with that just
to see if you're ok?
MS - No, no its fine.
LC- Ok.
MS - But you know and I mentioned that in my message even though I think on Monday in here in this room
I was told that {2955) is not working.
LC- Ok.
MS - Fortunately I took the screenshot and I saved. The final aim was the merging of all these individual files
and all these files are fully operational
LC- Ok.
MS- So they are all fully operational, the merging also will work but erm but the ...so on Thursday when we
went from the meeting we had where she clearly told me that little thing I had been putting together is
working and we will most likely get that resolved very soon.
LC - Uh huh.

Page 8 0f23-FM
LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY MARCEL SANGARE - 22.06.23

228

M5-And she even shoved me the next step as t when the merging is dane this is what l want ycu to add
on t that. lent from that t the email l received from you which l at first thought aas same sort of(30.45)
for my anser.
LC-Uh huh.
MS - So you know going from that to that you can understand how shaken l was so t speak.
C- Uh tuh.
MS - Yeah and so I lost onentraton on a few things and as I said that in writing it was without any

consequences so.
LC- Ok, alright And there's a few points 1 just kind of wanted to l inow we've kind of talked a bit of detail
on Tuesday but l just kind of want to irde back just after kind of darifying with Claire. So l know we discussed
the kind of current tasks that you've been working on and you said that that is running, you know you have
done that and Claire just advised that you know at one point whilst you have the resources imported and the
plans running erm the structure didn't meet what they were trying to achieve, there was no pipelines, there
was no PR and the branch was in no state to be merged which ultimately meant it didn't meet the definition
of done. What's your kind of thoughts on that would you say that is the case?
MS - Yeah, yeah, well in our team you raise the PR once you've..you know the process we have in the team
you raise a PR, so you know you raise a PR once you've finished work on a project and everyone agrees on
that, this is when you raise a PR that's one thing. Secondly erm saying that it is erm nothing is working I
would disagree with that, as I said I have the recording of the test run on every single of these VPCs and also
the test I showed her on Thursday which was the successful merging of many files at once. All of this is
working so all I would...of course it was not in the state of being merged yet...
LC-Ok.
MS - Because it was still work-in-progress
LC-Ok.
MS - As I say you have 21 files at first, once you start merging them 2x 2 you get to maybe 10 or 11 and then
up to point where you have a single file you need to push and once that single file is ready its only when that
single file is ready that you will be writing the you know the configuration and necessary for you to be able
to use you know our continued (33.0
7) this is how it works. So obviously it was still work-in-progress of
course, there was no PR raised because I was not done yet, the configuration for deployment is done once
everything is you know you've tested it, you know it's worked that's how it worked in our team.
LC-Ok.
MS - So I don't understand that.
LC - Ok. Have you got anything to add to that one?
DM - So you say you were done with the task but you also say it's a work-in-progress and it's not complete,
it can't be both things, the definition ...

229

MS- Well as usual. and Im sorry t that, as usual with yu bearse as tld yu an Monday and V'm happy
reordmg that, yu know your rle here is basically t find anything wrung with me so you're not trying t
understand the context
DM-fmsorry you an't say that
MS -Sot will say that, l an say that because the thing is as i ld you the first attempt at working this, the
first attempt at working this, the first attempt at merging these fles was
DM --So !remember because you've said it multiple times its ok we an shortut that par of it
MS -- The first attempt_t'm not shutting up because this is the context your refusing to take int aount,
this is one problem I have with your approach, T'm sony, you refuse to take the context into acount and this
is wrong because if you don't take the context into account you cannot be objective you need t know that
So the first time we tried to merge all these files there were sme conflict in terms of varables.
DM - Right let's just.it's alrght, it's alright let's just_
MS - As I've mentioned now, as I've mentioned just now you know Ire-wrote the whole thing and showed
to Claire that the merging would go easier.
DM- But none of that we required, none of that was asked for, none of that was wanted._
MS - Ok so..
DM -- By Claire or you.
MS -- Ok so it took._are you actually telling me here that it took2 or 3 months for someone to know that was
not what was required, does it sound right to you?
DM -- People immediately told you that you...
MS - Does it sound right to you.
DM -- Sorry if I could just finish. People..Claire specifically gave you a task...
MS - Yeah.
DM - Which was to take an existing AWC infrastructure ...
MS - Yeah.
DM - To put it into (35./17)
MS -- Yes exactly.
DM - As a single configuration file that then could be used as a template and put into a pipeline.
MS - Ok.
DM - What you produced was not that. When you were told the version of the 22 different folders was not
the correct approach rather than stopping and doing the approach that we asked to do...

LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORYMARCEL SANGARE- 22.06 23

230

A5- Yau want
DM - You twisted your urent architecture into something that wasn't required.
MS - Ok this is one more time your interpreta tion of the whole thing.
DM-It's not my interpretation it's the interpretation of the entire department
MS -It is your interpreta tion, so this is where the problem of bad faith is coming

in.

DM - There is no bad farth you refused t_
MS - There is bad faith let me tell you why, I've been doing that exercise for dose t a uple of months
DM-- Which is too long.
MS - Ok Ok that's your opinion and I respect that it's the same for me. When l joined it took me once again
to see that you know we have (36.05) yet it has been there for years.
DM -- But it took you 10 minutes to work out what your job was and you still haven't worked out what it is.
MS - No problem. So as l said you know putting all of that into a single file at once is not only risky but it's
very difficult.
DM- In your opinion but that's like your (36.20) in this whole team.
MS - When 1 spoke to her the first time I told her that "What are we doing we need to get the individual
configuration right first and once we know that the individual configurations are working then we will merge
them." and let me tell you this to prove you wrong the last meeting I had with her where I was showing her
that you know things weren't working that was precisely that showing that you know the merging of the
individual working configuration was fine she had no...she didn't see...she was not unhappy about that, there
was no condemnation about that and as I say zero condemnation and no contradiction, none of that for the
entire duration of the project so what is your opinion on that?
DM - Marcel you were just told by Laura three minutes ago...
MS- Yeah.
DM - That that's not what happened that Claire is certain that you were incorrect.
MS - Ok but this ...
LC - So are you disputing what Claire's saying?
MS - I am disputing that because it is under repository right now. So I have a simple question to ask if what
I was doing was completely wrong why for all this time no-one's stopping me? I'm asking you the question.
DM- We repeatedly tried to stop you...
MS- Oh really.

Page 11f23FM
LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY MARCEL SANGARE - 22.06.23

231

DM- Which iiswhy Jason gpt so frustrated at
M5 -So you see, you see, you see, ok fine, but the thing is yu see right now here, right now here, here fve
been stpped and 4 arept fr no good reason but for two months no waring, no complaint, zero, nothing,
you find that right?
C-l think though in terms of that process it was advised that you were course corrected a couple of times,
you spoke with Zoe who highligh ted issues with the structure and then you spoke with daire on a couple of
occasions just t query
it

MS-Yeah.
LC-So therefore from reading that like they are kind of cheking in with you and confirming that.
MS - No, no, no, no it's not confirming what he is saying here The first meeting I had with Claire was
regarding the version as I've said and I think we spoke long enough about that on Monday I don't want to
waste any more time with that but as i said the version 1.3.7 is outdated, not supported any more. So when
I was given no erm requirement and asked to do something about that I just used my good judgement to try
to at least start with a version that is at least supported, the 1.3.7 is not supported any more so this is why l
went for an intermediary version. Once I finished that the individual configuration were working and what
happened is when I had the meeting with Zoe she said "Ok the thing is with configuration you have you are
using a recent version but I would like you to use the 13.7." you know what I did I went back to work and
wrote the whole thing using 1.37 this is the story. This is not. I am sorry to tell you that this is not stopping
someone as such you know because stopping is stopping, this is not stopping and this is not even a warning
so let's be clear about that. Have you got any email or any letter whatever that was basically labelling that
as a waring? Absolutely not. And this is why I have and ! said that this is why I have issues with your way
of doing things because yau're not being objective and I need to state that here because I don't know how
things..how far we go you are not being objective. You have that repository right there and you are a
programmer yourself you can get there, you can connect to it, you can go online.
DM- I've seen it, Marcel l've seen it.
MS - And you can use the Github to see for yourself.
DM - And it's not acceptable.

MS - There is no warning, there was no warning.
DM -I can look at it and see what you did for the last 6 months it's not acceptable.
MS -Ok. Sorry? That's you opinion.
DM - What you've done for the last 6 months...well exactly, as a leader of this department. ..
MS-This is your opinion, that's your opinion but you need to prove it, why no warning? Because you know
the letter I received from HR, and let me make it clear for you here, the letter I received from HR where I'm
being told that...this is what was written that on Tuesday I might be losing my job on Tuesday. When
someone Is doing something wrong and I have to inform you on this you need to give him some clear warning
or to stop him as you say, this never happened you know what it means it was fine I was on the right track.
And the last meeting I had with Claire she distinctly said that this merging, this what I showed her was fine
and they will get...and she was sure and convinced that we were getting now to the final aim and she even
told me once the final aim is reached soon enough (4102) no erase (4
1,04) so that it can get merged into the

main branch and then l want yu t do this and this. Doesit sound tp yu file a waring or a way of stopping
sprnene? You come in here your making allegation i mean sary right now you're erther just repeating
whatever Claire tld yu or are yu just here t find something wrong w@th me and this is what you've been
doing since Monday, your just making assumptio n with zero demonstration behind
Why wasn't l given a
written warning f whatever was ding was wrong? Im asking you the qustin, you're nut answering that
just trying t jump t your own assumptions. And when you say that this is your opinion fine as l say let's go
with someone else someone who knows what he is tailing about and let's review the whole thing and you
will see for yourself.
it

LC-in terms of obviously David being in this meeting today Davi is a Manager of the department therefore
he has a knowledge of the process of the structures of the odes and things fike that, therefore he does have
an understanding of the situation. And you know like l was kind of obviously discussing with yourself in terms
of this task you were of curse corrected a uple of times you know someone highlighted issues. You then
contacted Claire a couple of times and she was having to go over it again with yourself and the oncer is
that you should have the skills and the knowledge to be able t complete this task without.
MS - What I have to say is the couple of times Claire (42
.20) not in the sense that you know there were you
know I was on the completely wrong track whatsoever it was more in the sense of you know maybe giving
some advice here and there, this was not a meeting where you know.and when you're saying and where I
feel very frustrated and slightly insulted, sorry for saying that but this is how I feel right now, you say that
you've seen it and it doesn't work, if I doesn't work_because the aim of the exercise was to make sure there
is zero difference with the configuration we have on your repository and what we have on the cloud. When
you run (42.57) there is zero difference so what kind of unsuccessfu l work or attempt is that, can you explain
that to me? Because you're not talking..
DM - Were going over the same points again, we're going back over the same points...
MS - Yeah.
DM-I'm never going to convince you...
MS -- Yeah.
DM - So what's the point of continuing back and forward?
MS - Yeah, so what is your point there? What do you say about that, if it working, I mean I have the
screenshot, it is working.
DM - It's not done, it's not done, we're asking you was it done...
MS - Uh huh.
DM - You said it was done, it wasn't done.
LC- So in your opinion did it meet the definition of done?
MS - Sorry?
LC - in your opinion did that task meet the definition of done?
MS -- The definition of done, when we say something is completely done it's all finished.

Page 130f 23-FM
LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY-MARCEL SANGARE - 22.06.23

233

LC- Jh huh.
M5- N the thing is to get t the finish fine there ar same intermediary steps.
LC- So had you completed them all?

now

MS - Yeah and that's what I said i was just that the_this s what t told yu, t get t a single fle you
needed to merge 22 separate networks which this gentleman here doesn't seem t understand these are
separate networks.
LC-Uh huh.
MS- So you need t write the configuration for every single of them and then try to merge them without
causing an accident by the way ok.
LC-Uh huh.
MS--So this is what l was doing. So for a job to be done you need to go successfully through the intermediary
steps, and the last meeting we had she was not disputing me for that you know we were on the right track
she said that herself so what is he talking about now?
LC- So l'm asking you like did that task meet the definition of done?
MS -It was not completely done.
LC-Uh huh.
MS - But as l say during the last meeting we had she was certain that it would get done very soon.
LC- So I think in terms of that the concern is the time taken to get to the point of it being the definition of
done to which where we're still not at, and that's the concern obviously in terms of that task how long it's
taken you to get to that point.
MS - I understand that and as l said this is the point we can discuss about till the end of time if necessary..
LC - Uh huh.
MS - But if we stick to the fact the plain fact is the time taken.
LC - Uh huh.
MS - You know these are as l said there was the writing the configuration for AS was unchartered territory
there was no requirement you understand?
LC -Ok.
MS - So as l said on Monday the first attempt was to avoid using the (45.21) which is not recommended but
AWS (45.24) and try to write it from scratch.
LC-Ok.

Page 140!23-FM
LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY MARCEL SANGARE - 22.06.23

234

Mt5- So when l fund that out and ame t share it with Claire she said t me that she didn't want that she
wanted t go fr the telephone import
lC-Yeah.
MS- When t went that route then ve used {45.41) and t have to say that, a rent version of the software
because we needed t tale something that is at least recent and not outdated, it's seems you know logical
to me. And when finished to do that Zoe told me Ok you've done it howeverwe would he this to be at
the same level as Asia." but as l mentioned on Monday Asia AWS are two separate produts.
LC-- Yeah so one point that you did put forward that there were no requirements in terms of the tasks so
that's something that l darified with Claire.
MS- Yeah, uh huh.
LC- So she'd kind of said that as the ticket was split the original description about which repo to use and that
it should be the same as our AKS structure was left on the first one and whilst the ticket didn't specify the
exact version to be used
MS -Uh huh
LC - Marcel had used our current repo and it was expected given his experience that he would follow the
structure and versioning that was consistent throughout.
MS- No this is too easy to speak like that, you see what l've got to say this is too easy to speak like that
LC - What do you mean by that?
MS - You know when you work in this software project or software work in general (1) there is no (46.52)
requirement because what you're reading i mean this is the Jira, I think it is coming from the Jira you know l
don't have the printing of it sol can't tell you ! have got no more access.
LC - Uh huh
MS - But one thing I can tell you Jira is not a requirement that's one thing. And secondly when I'm talking
about requirement here it's a proper document where you give clear instruction as to what you want to
achieve, how you want to achieve it and so on.
DM -I'm sorry Jira is a requirement that is (47
21)
MS - So right now, right now, from the first instruction I was given and I don't know if you can find a
screenshot of it you know there was no specification in terms of use that version of the software for example,
that's one.
LC - Uh huh.
MS - And l did it for quite some time, we had some meetings every day, every single day what l was reporting
about that so why is it that they didn't raise any concern then?
LC - Ok And it says that you know given your experience it would be expected..
MS- No, no.
Page 150f23-FM
LC - CONTNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY MARCEL SANGARE - 22.06 23

235

'IC-N, can I ask a questionsorry? tt said that given your experience would be experted that you would
follow the struture anti versionmg that was consistent throughout, whar's your thoughts on that?
it

M5- And given my experiene also, given my experiene also, it is necessary when we want t avoid his sort
of disussion to givea dear written requirement. And givenmy experience also it is wrong t use an outdated
and unsupported version of the to! to write configuration. So this point why is it not taken into aunt?
And as l say, the last point want to raise, we have daily meetingsLC-Uh huh.
MS-For how many months Tve been here.
LC- Uh huh.
MS -- Since December, so dose to 7 months, so out of these 7 months if what I was doing was that rubbish
why there is no clear waring about my work?
LC -- So Claire advised that she did on numerous occasions point out to yourself that things weren't being
committed or were not as expected leaving
MS - It's not on numerous occasions
LC - Sorry..
MS - It was just once and I remember and I have a screenshot of that.
LC - Leading course corrections throughout the tasks.
MS - Yeah.
LC - So she said that she had repeatedly asked you to push, remember to push and things like that.
MS- Yeah, and this is not numerous occasions it happened once and you want to know when precisely it
was?
LC - Uh huh.
MS -It was at the time where we were changing...when I was changing the version from the recent one lwas
using to the old one, there were a couple of days where I was just trying to work everything and during that
time we had a meeting where she told me but why is it that you are not pushing, pushing things and I told
her "No I'm just re-working the whole structure before getting..." and started again and that was just once.
LC - And can you recall when that was?
MS - I don't have the date on top of my mind but I have the screenshot I can send you the date later.
LC - Yeah, just because l've got some information from her so she had sent a message on 27 April just to
say remember to push your work to the branch.
MS - Ok.

Page 16 at23-FM
LC - CONITNUED EMPLOYMENT MEETING - MORY MARCEL SANGARE - 22 06 23

236

LC- She had sentone on 19 May saying please remember t push your local mm7ts t GIT.
M5- Yeah, uh huh.
LC - Erm she also mentioned again on 23" May saying just remember to commit
MS -Uh huh.
LC - So you know that's several occasions that she is saying to yourself.
MS -- Ok and here again I can explain that. The first time she mentioned that, the first time she mentioned
and push as I said l was in the process of reworking things, that's one.
LC- Uh huh.
MS - The second time she mentioned this and l'm sure l can find the answer I sent to her on that occasion,
on that occasion I told her "Yes will do it l'm just you know finishing to re-work the lines of code I have here
before pushing it." beause as l said before and N think the second time that was one day at around if you
look at the time it was most likely the second occasion that we're talking about that was most likely before
12.00 pm.
LC-Ok
MS - Yeah, am I correct? And if you check you know usually when I push some coding it is usually after that
time..
LC-Ok.
MS- Because in the morning I'm still working so this is the information for the second occasion. And as I said
I'm sorry like you know for the kind of work I was doing on AWS there are two things there, there is the
writing of code of course but there is also the work around and the impact whatever you're doing with the
procedure and sometimes it takes time...
LC - Uh huh.
MS - Its not just about pushing code you also need to check the consequence of what you're doing.
LC - Yeah I understand that but obviously in terms of you know the processes of Arnold Clark like pushing
the code is something that you know we expect the engineers to do, and from speaking with David you know
he kind of stipulated maybe S or 6 times a day. And Claire says that you know although that's you know
maybe the expectation she wasn't asking yourself to do that she was asking yourself to maybe do it daily.
MS - Uh huh.
LC - But there was times there was maybe like a space of like a week where you weren't pushing at all.
MS - No, no that was right in the beginning because it took quite a bit of time because all the things that
you're saying right now I don't have the screenshot right in front of me ...
LC- Uh huh.
MS - But as I do have a copy of our discussions I can clearly explain all these things.

(C--Ok

M5 - And one mare tie what I have t say and t have to emphasise on that with the #ind of work we are
ding when we are tying to reassess the situation you know before doing some real work, making some
important changes, wile your doing that work of assessment you cant be pushing at the same time. And
when I joined, and I need to insist on that, when l joined erm at the time l joined it was happening you know,
the time I joined the company was having some issues, l think it was only.erm and I wasn't.I was the one
actually you know runing after her even to get some stuff to do. I think it's only around if ry memory is
correct but I7 need to check my note and give you a precise date but I think it was only around
February/March that i was given AWS task to start working on. And t think l'll explain many more times what
happened and all these things that I have been saying I don't see and I'm sorry to say that, I don't see where
I was being negligent or where l wasbeause to receive the letter I received you know the intent of what l
was doing should have been to maybe being careless about the interest of the company or not or being
umwilling to do the things property.
LC- Uh huh
MS - And I have to insist on that erm the first time she told me to push l was still analysing, the two other
times these were just_and that's how I took friendly reminders, the second time as you said on the second
occasion where she spoke about that you know that was a friendly reminder because right after that l was
pushing the code you know. When I received that from her l was still working on the thing, I can't be pushing
something that is bugged or something like that and this is not and this is what l've been trying to explain,
when I first joined you know every time l am pushing some code, the code l'm pushing has been fully tested
and is working Now I know some people...and this is what l explained, to get from 3 to 5 there are many
ways to do it Now where is it written for example in my contract that I should be pushing 5 times a day? In
my contract...
LC- But Claire said to you several times to make sure you're pushing daily so the expectation is that you
follow management instruction. You said that you know you trust Claire.
MS - And this is what I'm saying I was following management instruction, when I was not pushing I was
analysing maybe some bugs or just trying to see the consequences of code I was doing.
LC - l appreciate that but the expectation and part of the process is that you push at the very minimal once
a day...
MS - Yeah.
LC - Because when you're doing that it means that management like Claire etc can go in, they can check
your work, if you're not doing that they can't do that.
MS - But then the point you're not raising is you know we have some daily meetings where we talk about
the problems we've had or what happens during the day. As I said when you are having to deal with some
infrastructure problem you can't be pushing at the same time. I think what is happening here, I think what is
happening here is you know and this Is what I told you on Monday, if it's just a way to justify what happened
I think its fine you know people can justify or find justification for anything but the thing is we also need to
analyse the circumstances this is what l mentioned just now and we also need to take into account the broad
context. When you're analysing the infrastructure after having done some modification and going from
something you can't be pushing at the same time, you can't be told that.

C- Bt the expetation is that yu should at least be pushing daily whuh yu weren't yu were going days
without pushing and that's a cnern.
MS -And as1say that was in the early beginning and as 1 said if what your saying istrue and if that was an
issue wty didn't get a written waring about that?
LC- You were spoken t on several oasins by management t ensure that you re pushing.
MS- No, no, what you've just read, !'m sorry to say that madam, what you just read is not a dear warning,
this is not a warning Tm sorry.
LC- But its management giving you instruction that you failed to follow.
MS - Which l was following of course, which I was following but this what you just read is not a waring.
LC -!'m not saying it's a warning l'm saying that you were given management instruction.
MS - Which l was following and I repeat that again but..and I think I have explained myself on numerous
times about that. I have never disrespected her.
LC - Uh huh.
MS - Whatever she was telling me to do I will do it
LC- Yeah.
MS - And for whenever I was not able to do it l will tell her why, this is why we have our daily meeting if you
see what I mean?
LC -- Yeah, so Claire raised concerns to myself that you haven't been pushing daily and that she's got concerns
with that and you've said that you and Claire have a good relationship so why do you think that Claire is
raising these concerns about you not pushing?
MS - As I said this is not a concern, the first time she spoke about that...
LC -- Its not for you to say its not a concern l've got management telling us it's a concern.
MS - Ok but I am also entitled to give some explanation about what I saw and what happened ok?
LC - Yeah of course.
MS - Ok so as I told you the first time she mentioned that as I said I was in the process of reanalysing things...
LC- Uh huh.
MS - And I even explained to her what happened. The second time she raised that concern ...
LC- Uh huh.
MS - I'm sure I can find that screenshot, I replied to her that don't worry I will do it, I'm just finishing some
written pieces of the code if you see what I mean?

LC-Uh huh
M5 - So hat's what l said zhe send time but the point l want t raise fr of all l have never disputed
whatever she asked me to do, I disagree with that sorry ok And the second point is whatever yu say this is
not a waring, this is not a waring because for the letter I received from you an Thursday that was telling
me yu know you could lase your job on Tuesday, no I mean to get t that point there is a process to be
followed and l am sorry the process was not followed. Now i think sine Monday and l don't want to keep
on talking for to long, smne Monday I think l gave you my version of everything
i

LC-Uh huh.
MS -I have tried to explain you know what happened and can't do any better than that.
LC - Ok, alright Anything that you want to elaborate on, anything else that you want to go through at all?
MS-I think l've said it all so you know I will go with whatever you have to do
LC- Anything that you want to elaborate on?
DM --l'm fine.
LC - No, perfect. So what we will do Marcel is we will just take an adjournment to consider everything that's
been put forward today so what to do is even if you just want to kind of go and sit in the hub or something
like that_
MS -Ok.
LC - Then when l'm able to reconvene erm we will call you back through, is that alright?
MS - Ok, ok.
LC - Perfect.
Meeting adjourned:
Meeting reconvened:
LC - That's it just on there. Alright so this is the second half of the meeting.
MS - Uh huh.
LC- So in the first half of the meeting we obviously considered everything that's been put forward, we've
considered everything sorry that's been put forward sorry in the first half of the meeting. So we discussed
concerns with your overall capability within your role erm and that was specifically in relation to your failure
to perform tasks In a timely manner, erm to utilise our systems efficiently and to perform the tasks expected
in your role to the standard expected. So in terms of the concerns that you brought to my attention today I
know you discussed a few at the start erm one of which being the route account. So I spoke to David Keenan
just in relation to that and he has advised that that is something that is being investigated.
MS - Ok.

MS- Ok.
LC - However you did take it upon yourself to use a different process.
MS - This is not true but yeah if that's your opinion that's fine.
LC - Ok. As you know you specified you know yourself that there was no requirements given erm however
from speaking with management you know given your experience that you should have all the structure and
versioning that was consistent throughout..
MS - Obviously, obviously.
LC - However you failed to do so.

MS - Ok.
LC - We also spoke through your concerns with your failure to push despite Claire advising you on several
occasions to do so and you know you'll know yourself because you regulate as an industry standard erm as
there is a requirement for you to do so, erm however you failed to regularly do this erm despite receiving
management instruction
you to do this. Vou spoke through the concerns with Jason White erm and
you spoke through also concerns with the way Jason White was kind of towards Claire. And I have spoken
with Claire who advised that you know whilst Jason can be quite blunt and to the point she has no concerns
with his conduct erm and would contact us if she had a concern with how Jason spoke with her. And you did
advise that you have other individuals to approach should you require any assistance including Greig, Claire,
Zoe and therefore I appreciate while you know how you felt in this situation erm however I do acknowledge
that you've got other individuals that you can approach erm and therefore I don't believe that your
relationship with Jason would impact on your performance. You advised that you have had no written
warning regarding your performance erm however as mentioned you did have several messages from Claire
giving you management instruction.

Statement of Loss
To the attention of the employment Tribunal - Case 8000485/2023

Object: Statement of Loss

Your Honour,

Pursuant to the directives issued by you during the preliminary hearing, | (the Claimant
Sangare M.) would like to submit my statement of loss as it pertains to the employment
tribunal claim against Arnold Clark. This document aims to outline the financial and
emotional impact of the series of events leading to, and following, my unjust dismissal from
my position at the company. As a dedicated employee from December 2022 until the end
of June 2023, the abrupt and unfair termination of my employment has not only resulted in
significant financial loss but also inflicted considerable emotional distress.

The purpose of this statement is to provide a detailed account of the losses | have incurred
as a result of wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, direct and indirect discrimination,
harassment, whistleblowing, and victimization. These claims are grounded in both Scottish
and UK employment law, which recognizes the rights of employees to seek redress for
such grievances.

In the following sections, | will break down the various components of my claim,
quantifying the financial impact and articulating the emotional toll these events have taken
on my personal and professional life. This claim, totalling £120,000, is a reflection of the
substantial losses | have endured and is supported by the evidence and circumstances
detailed herein.

1. Introduction:

|, M. Sangare was employed by Arnold Clark from December 2022 until my unjust
dismissal at the end of June 2023. My annual salary was £57,500, equivalent to £3,489
per month after tax. Following my dismissal in mid-June 2023, | was unemployed until the
8th of October 2023 and got my first salary in my new positon at the end of October 2023.

2. Breakdown of Losses:

A. Loss of Earnings:

Period of Unemployment: Mid June 2023 to October 2023 (3.5 months).
Monthly Salary (After Tax): £3,489.
Total Loss of Earnings: £3,489 x 3.5 = £12,211.5.

B. Future Loss of Earnings:

Considering the potential for career progression and salary increments, and bonuses an
additional 10% of the annual salary plus £5233.5 is claimed for future loss of earnings.

248


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 28.statement_of_loss.pdf

Additional Claim: £5,750 (10% of £57,500) + £ 5233.5 = £ 10983.5.

C. Injury to Feelings:

The distress caused by wrongful dismissal, discrimination, harassment, and
victimization is significant. In line with Vento guidelines and considering the severity of the
case, a claim of £30,000 is made for injury to feelings.

D. Aggravated Damages:

While Scottish law does not recognize "aggravated damages" in the same way as other
legal systems, the egregious nature of the employer's conduct warrants a higher
compensation. An additional £20,000 is claimed for the manner of dismissal and
subsequent treatment.

E. Loss of Statutory Rights:

 

Due to the unfair dismissal, | have lost certain statutory employment rights. A claim of
£5,000 is made for this loss.

F. Whistleblowing Repercussions:
The negative treatment and victimization following my whistleblowing activities warrant

additional compensation. A claim of £15,000 is made for the repercussions of
whistleblowing.

G. Legal Costs:

Given the complexity of the case, legal costs are estimated at £10,000 which include the
time and resources used and dedicated to the preparation and handling of the case.

H. Additional Losses:

Considering the broader impact on my professional reputation and mental health, an
additional claim of £16,805 is made.

3. Total Claim:

The sum of the above claims amounts to £120,000, which is sought as compensation
for the losses and harm suffered due to the unjust treatment by my employer.

4. Conclusion:
This claim is made in accordance with Scottish and UK employment law, focusing on loss
of earnings, injury to feelings, and potential future losses. The treatment | endured,

including wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, direct and indirect discrimination,
harassment, whistleblowing, and victimization, justifies this claim.

Bullying at work

What bullying is

Although there is no legal definition of bullying, it can be described as unwanted behaviour from a person or group that is either:

e offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting
e an abuse or misuse of power that undermines, humiliates, or causes physical or emotional harm to someone

Bullying might:

e be a regular pattern of behaviour or a one-off incident
e happen face-to-face, on social media, in emails or calls
e happen at work or in other work-related situations

e not always be obvious or noticed by others

It's possible someone might not know their behaviour is bullying. It can still be bullying even if they do not realise it or do not intend to
bully someone.

Examples of bullying

Examples of bullying at work could include:

e constantly criticising someone's work

e spreading malicious rumours about someone

e constantly putting someone down in meetings

e deliberately giving someone a heavier workload than everyone else

e excluding someone from team social events

e putting humiliating, offensive or threatening comments or photos on social media

Upward bullying

Bullying can also happen from staff towards someone more senior, for example a manager. This is sometimes called 'upward bullying’
or ‘subordinate bullying’.

It can be from one employee or a group of employees.
Examples of upward bullying can include:

e showing continued disrespect
e refusing to complete tasks
e spreading rumours

Page 1

258


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 29.acas_guide_bullying_at_work.pdf

e constantly undermining someone's authority
e doing things to make someone seem unskilled or unable to do their job properly

It can be difficult for someone in a senior role to realise they're experiencing bullying behaviour from their staff.

It's important to consider the real reasons for the behaviour. For example, there might be a wider issue with the culture of the
organisation that can be identified and addressed.

When bullying might be harassment

Bullying and harassment are often confused. By law (Equality Act 2010), bullying behaviour can be harassment if it relates to any of
the following ‘protected characteristics’:

e age
e disability

e gender reassignment
e race

e religion or belief

e Sex

e sexual orientation

Find out more about harassment

 

Bullying that's not classed as harassment could still lead to other legal issues. For example, severe bullying might contribute towards
constructive dismissal.

Employer responsibilities
Employers and employees have a mutual duty to treat each other honestly and with respect.

This means employees have the right to:

e have trust and confidence in their employer
e expect not to be bullied at work

Employers have the right to:

e expect employees not to bully each other
e expect employees to treat their managers with respect and follow all reasonable instructions

Employers also have a legal duty of care to protect their employees from harm. This includes dealing with bullying issues.
Employers should:

e do all they can to try to prevent bullying happening
e take any bullying complaint seriously and look into it as soon as possible

Dealing with a problem raised by an employee

Many problems at work can be resolved informally, for example through an informal chat.

An employee could raise a problem informally by telling their line manager or someone else at work, for example, another manager or
someone in HR. It does not have to be in writing at this stage.

Take the problem seriously

If an employee raises a problem informally, you should still take it seriously.

If you do not, the problem might be raised as a formal grievance later. A formal grievance might lead to the employee making a claim
to an employment tribunal if it's not resolved.

It's also important to take it seriously to help:

e keep a good working relationship with the employee
e avoid a formal grievance procedure — this can affect your organisation's reputation, take time and be difficult for everyone
involved

It's a good idea to:

e set up an informal chat or meeting to discuss their concerns
e agree to any request from the employee to bring someone they work with, a trade union representative or other relevant person
to a meeting

It's usually up to you to agree if the employee can bring someone else to the meeting. If discrimination law applies you might have to
allow someone to come with them to help remove any disadvantage.

For example, allowing a support or care worker to attend to provide support could be considered a reasonable adjustment if it would
reduce any disadvantage a disabled person might face in raising their problem.

Solving the problem should be a two-way process so that:

e you let the employee explain the problem and any solution, for example asking the employee what they would like done about it
e the employee listens to what you have to say

Keep a record

You should keep a record of how you dealt with the problem, even if it was informal.
The record should include:

e what the problem is about
e what you did, such as have an informal meeting

e what was discussed in any informal chat or meeting
e any next steps agreed
e the reasons for any next steps

It's a good idea to make sure next steps are clear, specific and measurable. For example, 'person A will do action B by date C,
because of reason D'.

Following up

You should ask the employee if the problem is now resolved for them. If it is not, to move things forward you could:

e check any next steps have been completed
e set up more informal discussions
e find out if anything else can be done

You should remind them they can also raise the grievance formally.

If the employee raises a formal grievance

The employee might raise the grievance formally if:

e they feel raising it informally has not worked
e it's a serious issue, for example sexual assault or whistleblowing
e they do not want to resolve it informally — you can still suggest this as an option

They should raise the formal grievance:

e as soon as possible
e in writing, outlining what the problem is

If you do not follow a formal procedure, it could affect the outcome if the problem reaches an employment tribunal.
Who they should raise it with

You should have an organisation grievance policy that says who employees should raise grievances to.

If you do not have one, they should raise it to a manager. This can be either their own manager or someone else, such as an HR
manager.

Using mediation

You can use mediation at any stage of the procedure. Mediation involves an independent, impartial person helping both sides to find a
solution.

The mediator can be someone from inside or outside your organisation. If they're from outside your organisation, you might need to
pay.

Both sides will need to agree to mediation.

Discipline and grievances at work

Introduction

This guide provides good practice advice for dealing with discipline and
grievances in the workplace. It complements the Acas Code of Practice on
disciplinary and grievance procedures. Extracts from the Code of Practice are
reproduced in boxes accompanied by further practical advice and guidance.

The Acas Code of Practice sets out principles for handling disciplinary and
grievance situations in the workplace. This guide provides more detailed advice
and guidance that employers and employees will often find helpful both in
general terms and in individual cases.

 

Employment Tribunals and the Acas Code of Practice on
Disciplinary and Grievance procedures

Employment tribunals are legally required to take the Acas Code of Practice into
account when considering relevant cases.

Tribunals are also be able to adjust any compensatory awards made in these
cases by up to 25 per cent for unreasonable failure to comply with any provision
of the Code.

This means that if the tribunal feels that an employer has unreasonably failed to
follow the guidance set out in the Code they can increase any award they have
made by up to 25 per cent.

Conversely, if they feel an employee has unreasonably failed to follow the
guidance set out in the Code they can reduce any award they have made by up
to 25 per cent.

Employment tribunals are not required to have regard to guidance in this booklet
that does not form part of the Code.

 

The law on unfair dismissal requires employers to act reasonably when dealing
with disciplinary issues. What is classed as reasonable behaviour will depend on
the circumstances of each case, and is ultimately a matter for employment
tribunals to decide. However, the core principles are set out in the Acas Code of
Practice.

Employers and employees should always seek to resolve disciplinary and
grievance issues in the workplace. If discipline and grievance issues are settled
at an early stage they are normally less time-consuming and less likely to
damage working relationships.

Good employment relations practices - including for recruitment, induction
training, communications and consultation —- can prevent many discipline and
grievance problems arising. Organisations are also more likely to have positive
employment relationships if they make efforts to gain their employees’
commitment through:

e showing them clear leadership and letting them know how they can
contribute

Using mediation

An independent third party or mediator can sometimes help resolve disciplinary
or grievance issues. Mediation is a voluntary process where the mediator helps
two or more people in dispute to attempt to reach an agreement. Any
agreement comes from those in dispute, not from the mediator. The mediator is
not there to judge, to say one person is right and the other wrong, or to tell
those involved in the mediation what they should do. The mediator is in charge
of the process of seeking to resolve the problem but not the outcome.

Mediators may be employees trained and accredited by an external mediation
service who act as internal mediators in addition to their day jobs. Or they may
be from an external mediation provider. They can work individually or in pairs as
co-mediators.

Discipline and grievances at work

There are no hard-and-fast rules for when mediation is appropriate but it can be
used:

° for conflict involving colleagues of a similar job or grade, or between a line
manager and their staff

° at any stage in the conflict as long as any ongoing formal procedures are
temporarily suspended, or where mediation is included as a stage in the
procedures themselves

* to rebuild relationships after a formal dispute has been resolved

° to address a range of issues, including relationship breakdown, personality
clashes, communication problems, bullying and harassment.

In some organisations mediation is written into formal discipline and grievance
procedures as an optional stage. Where this is not the case, it is useful to be
clear about whether the discipline and grievance procedure can be suspended if
mediation is deemed to be an appropriate method of resolving the dispute.

Grievances most obviously lend themselves to the possibility of mediation.
Managers may not always see it as appropriate to surrender their discretion in
relation to disciplinary issues where they believe a point of principle is at stake,
such as misconduct or poor performance. However, disciplinary and grievance
issues can become blurred, and the employer may prefer to tackle the
underlying relationship issues by means of mediation.

Cases unsuitable for mediation
Mediation may not be suitable if:

° used as a first resort - because people should be encouraged to speak to
each other and talk to their manager before they seek a solution via
mediation

e jit is used by a manager to avoid their managerial responsibilities

* a decision about right or wrong is needed, for example where there is
possible criminal activity

e the individual bringing a discrimination or harassment case wants it
investigated

° the parties do not have the power to settle the issue

* one side is completely intransigent and using mediation will only raise
unrealistic expectations of a positive outcome.

For more information about mediation see www.acas.org.uk/mediation and the
Acas/CIPD guide Mediation: an approach to resolving workplace issues which
can be downloaded from the website.

Discipline and grievances at work
Discipline: keys to handling disciplinary problems in
the workplace

Resolve discipline issues informally

Cases of minor misconduct or unsatisfactory performance are usually best dealt
with informally. A quiet word is often all that is required to improve an
employee’s conduct or performance. In some cases additional training, coaching
and advice may be what is needed. An informal approach may be particularly
helpful in small firms, where problems can be resolved quickly and
confidentially. There will be situations where matters are more serious or where
an informal approach has been tried but is not working.

If informal action does not bring about an improvement, or the misconduct or
unsatisfactory performance is considered too serious to be classed as minor,
employers should provide employees with a clear signal of their dissatisfaction
by taking formal action.

 

Discipline in practice: Example 1
A valued and generally reliable employee is late for work on a number of
occasions causing difficulty for other staff who have to provide cover.

You talk to the employee on his own and he reveals that he has recently split up
with his wife and he now has to take the children to school on the way to work.
You agree a temporary adjustment to his start and finish times and he
undertakes to make arrangements for ‘school run’ cover which solves the
problem. You decide that formal disciplinary action is not appropriate.

 

How should it be done?

Talk to the employee in private. This should be a two-way discussion, aimed at
discussing possible shortcomings in conduct or performance and encouraging
improvement. Criticism should be constructive, with the emphasis being on
finding ways for the employee to improve and for the improvement to be
sustained.

Listen to whatever the employee has to say about the issue. It may become
evident there is no problem -— if so make this clear to the employee.

Where improvement is required make sure the employee understands what
needs to be done, how their performance or conduct will be reviewed, and over
what period. It may be useful to confirm in writing what has been decided.

Be careful that any informal action does not turn into formal disciplinary action,
as this may unintentionally deny certain rights, such as the right to be
accompanied. If, during the discussion, it becomes obvious that the matter may
be more serious, the meeting should be adjourned. The employee should be told
that the matter will be continued under the formal disciplinary procedure.

Keep brief notes of any agreed informal action for reference purposes. There
should be reviews of progress over specified periods.

Discipline and grievances at work

Consider at any stage whether the use of an independent mediator may be
helpful.

 

Develop rules and procedures

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Fairness and transparency are promoted by developing and using rules and
procedures for handling disciplinary and grievance situations. These should be
set down in writing, be specific and clear. Employees and, where appropriate,
their representatives should be involved in the development of rules and
procedures. It is also important to help employees and managers understand
what the rules and procedures are, where they can be found and how they are
to be used.

 

Rules and performance standards

Clear rules benefit employees and set standards of conduct. They also help
employers to act fairly and consistently.

Employers should also set standards of performance so that employees know
what is expected of them. This is usually done as part of an organisation’s
performance management which will involve agreeing objectives and reviewing
performance on a regular basis.

What should rules cover?

Different organisations will have different requirements but rules often cover
such matters as:

* timekeeping

° absence

e health and safety

° use of organisation facilities

° discrimination, bullying and harassment
° personal appearance

¢ the types of conduct that might be considered as ‘gross misconduct’.

 

How should rules be drawn up and communicated?

Rules are likely to be more effective if they are accepted as reasonable by those
covered by them and those who operate them. It is good practice to develop
rules in consultation with employees (and their representatives where
appropriate) and those who will have responsibility for applying them.

11

Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work
Unless there are reasons why different sets of rules apply to different groups
they should apply to all employees at all levels in the organisation.

The rules should not discriminate on the grounds of age, disability, gender
reassignment, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy and maternity, race,
religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation.

Writing down the rules helps both managers and employees know what is
expected of them. The rules should be made clear to employees. Ideally
employees should be given their own printed copy of the rules or written
information about how to access them. For example, on the organisation’s
intranet or in their personnel handbook. Employees are entitled to a written
statement of employment particulars which must include a note about
disciplinary rules and procedures. (Guidance on what the written statement must

include is provided on www.acas.org.uk.)

In a small organisation, it may be sufficient for rules to be displayed in a
prominent place. See Appendix 1 for a checklist on ‘Disciplinary rules for small

organisations’.

 

 

Clearly communicate the rules to everyone

Special attention should be paid to ensure that rules are understood by any
employees without recent experience of working life (for instance young people
new to the workld of work, or those returning to work after a lengthy break),
and by employees whose English or reading ability is limited, or who have a
disability such as visual impairment.

 

Why have a disciplinary procedure?

A disciplinary procedure is the means by which rules are observed and standards
are maintained.

The procedure should be used primarily to help and encourage employees to
improve rather than just as a way of imposing punishment. It provides a method
of dealing with any apparent shortcomings in conduct or performance and can
help an employee to become effective again. The procedure should be fair,
effective, and consistently applied.

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Disciplinary situations include misconduct and/or poor performance. If employers
have a separate capability procedure they may prefer to address performance
issues under this procedure. If so, however, the basic principles of fairness set
out in this Code should still be followed, albeit that they may need to be
adapted.

What should disciplinary procedures contain?

When drawing up and applying procedures, employers should always bear in
mind principles of fairness. For example, employees should be informed of the
allegations against them, together with the supporting evidence, in advance of
the meeting. Employees should be given the opportunity to challenge the

12

Discipline and grievances at work

allegations before decisions are reached and should be provided with a right to
appeal. Good disciplinary procedures should:

° be in writing

* be non-discriminatory

° provide for matters to be dealt with speedily

¢ allow for information to be kept confidential

° tell employees what disciplinary action might be taken

e say what levels of management have the authority to take the various
forms of disciplinary action

* require employees to be informed of the complaints against them and
supporting evidence, before a disciplinary meeting

* give employees a chance to have their say before management reaches a
decision

° provide for the right to be accompanied at disciplinary hearings

° provide that no employee is dismissed for a first breach of discipline,
except in cases of gross misconduct

* require management to investigate fully before any disciplinary action is
taken

* ensure that employees are given an explanation for any sanction and
allow employees to appeal against a decision

° apply to all employees, irrespective of their length of service or status, or
say if there are different rules for different groups, and ensure that:

— any investigatory period of suspension is with pay, and that it is clear
how pay is to be calculated during this period. (If, exceptionally,
suspension is to be without pay, this must be provided for in the
contract of employment)

— any suspension is brief, is never used as a sanction against the
employee prior to a disciplinary meeting and decision, and the
suspended employee is kept informed of progress

— the employee will be heard in good faith and that there is no
prejudgement of the issue

— where the facts are in dispute, no disciplinary penalty is imposed until
the case has been carefully investigated, and there is a reasonably
held belief that the employee committed the act in question.

Discipline and grievances at work
Samples of disciplinary procedures are provided at Appendix 2 and may be
adapted according to the requirements of the organisation.

Reviewing rules and procedures

Keep rules and procedures under review to make sure they are always relevant
and effective. Address any shortcomings as they arise. Employees and their
representatives should be consulted before new or additional rules are
introduced.

Training

Good training helps managers achieve positive outcomes, reducing the need for
any further disciplinary action. Those responsible for using and operating the
disciplinary rules and procedures, including managers at all levels, should be
trained for the task.

Ignoring or circumventing the procedures when dismissing an employee is likely
to have a bearing on the outcome of any subsequent employment tribunal claim.

If the organisation recognises trade unions, or there is any other form of
employee representation, it can be useful to undertake training on a joint basis -
everyone then has the same understanding and has an opportunity to work
through the procedure, clarifying any issues that might arise.

For information about suitable training see the Acas website
www.acas.org.uk/training

 

Keeping written records
What records should be kept?

The foreword to the Code of Practice advises employers to keep a written record
of any disciplinary or grievances cases they deal with.

Records should include:

* the complaint against the employee
e the employee’s defence

° findings made and actions taken

e the reason for actions taken

e whether an appeal was lodged

° the outcome of the appeal

* any grievances raised during the disciplinary procedure
* subsequent developments

* notes of any formal meetings.

Discipline and grievances at work

Records should be treated as confidential and be kept no longer than necessary
in accordance with the data protection principles set out in the Data Protection
Act 2018. This Act also gives individuals the right to request and have access to
certain personal data stored about them. See Appendix 5 for further information.

 

Copies of meeting records should be given to the employee including copies of
any formal minutes that may have been taken. In certain circumstances (for
example to protect a witness) the employer might withhold some information.

Dealing fairly with formal disciplinary action

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Where some form of formal action is needed, what action is reasonable or
justified will depend on all the circumstances of the particular case. Employment
tribunals will take the size and resources of an employer into account when
deciding on relevant cases and it may sometimes not be practicable for all
employers to take all of the steps set out in this Code.

That said, whenever a disciplinary or grievance process is being followed it is
important to deal with issues fairly. There are a number of elements to this:

¢ Employers and employees should raise and deal with issues promptly and
should not unreasonably delay meetings, decisions or confirmation of those
decisions

¢ Employers and employees should act consistently

« Employers should carry out any necessary investigations, to establish the
facts of the case

« Employers should inform employees of the basis of the problem and give
them an opportunity to put their case in response before any decisions are
made

* Employers should allow employees to be accompanied at any formal
disciplinary or grievance meeting

« Employers should allow an employee to appeal against any formal decision
made.

 

The following pages give detailed guidance on handling formal disciplinary
issues. Always bear in mind the need for fairness when following procedures
taking account of the elements from the Acas Code of Practice reproduced
above.

Dealing with absence is only one of any number of issues where disciplinary
action may be considered. It can, however, raise particular problems and is dealt
with separately at Appendix 4 — Dealing with absence.

 

A disciplinary process can be stressful for everyone involved. Different
individuals will respond differently to stressful situations. Sometimes the
15

Discipline and grievances at work

prospect of dismissal or other disciplinary sanction may cause extreme distress
and impact on a person’s mental health. Employers should consider how they
can provide support to minimise the risk of this happening.

Where there are any signs of this happening to anyone involved in the process,
employers should consider whether the process can be adjusted in some way,
such as by allowing the individual to be accompanied at a disciplinary
investigation meeting even where there is no formal right to be accompanied.

 

In some cases, it might be appropriate for an employer, with the agreement and
involvement of the individual, to seek professional medical help or guidance as
to how the disciplinary process can proceed fairly. If there are clear and
repeated signs of distress, the employer should encourage the individual to use
an employee assistance programme, where one is available, or consider
suggesting that the individual seeks advice from a GP. It is important to address
this issue early to avoid it escalating.

If someone has an existing mental health condition which they have previously
disclosed as a disability, the employer must make reasonable adjustments to the
process.

Employers may also wish to consider training to equip managers with the skills
needed to recognise the signs and symptoms of someone whose mental health
may be adversely affected by a disciplinary process.

Establishing the facts

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

It is important to carry out necessary investigations of potential disciplinary
matters without unreasonable delay to establish the facts of the case. In some
cases this will require the holding of an investigatory meeting with the employee
before proceeding to any disciplinary hearing. In others, the investigatory stage
will be the collation of evidence by the employer for use at any disciplinary
hearing.

In misconduct cases, where practicable, different people should carry out the
investigation and disciplinary hearing.

If there is an investigatory meeting this should not by itself result in any
disciplinary action. Although there is no statutory right for an employee to be
accompanied at a formal [disciplinary] investigatory meeting, such a right may
be allowed under an employer’s own procedure.

In cases where a period of suspension with pay is considered necessary, this
period should be as brief as possible, should be kept under review and it should
be made clear that this suspension is not considered a disciplinary action.

 

Investigating cases

When investigating a disciplinary matter take care to deal with the employee in a
fair and reasonable manner. The nature and extent of the investigations will
depend on the seriousness of the matter and the more serious it is then the
more thorough the investigation should be. It is important to keep an open mind
16

Discipline and grievances at work

and look for evidence which supports the employee’s case as well as evidence
against.

It is not always necessary to hold an investigatory meeting (often called a fact
finding meeting). If a meeting is held, give the employee advance notice of it
and time to prepare.

Any investigatory meeting should be conducted by a management
representative and should be confined to establishing the facts of the case. It is
important that disciplinary action is not considered at an investigatory meeting.
If it becomes apparent that formal disciplinary action may be needed then this
should be dealt with at a formal hearing at which the statutory right to be
accompanied will apply. See also ‘Use of external consultants’.

guide on Conducting Investigations in the Workplace

Suspension

There may be instances where the suspension of an employee is necessary while
investigations are carried out.

Employees must always receive their full pay and benefits during a period of
suspension unless there is a clear contractual right for an employer to suspend
without pay or benefits. Disciplinary procedures should specify how pay is to be
calculated during any period of suspension.

Employers should seek advice if they are considering suspension without pay. A
period of unpaid suspension is more likely to be viewed as a disciplinary sanction
and could lead to accusations that the disciplinary procedure was not fair.

Suspension should be kept as brief as possible and should not exceed any
maximum period which may be set out in the contract. If suspension is
unreasonably prolonged it may then be open to the worker to take action for
breach of contract, or in extreme cases to resign and claim constructive
dismissal. Suspension should be reviewed regularly to decide whether it is still
necessary and the suspended employee kept informed of progress.

Most disciplinary situations will not require suspension. It should only be
considered exceptionally if there is a serious allegation of misconduct and:

° there are reasonable grounds to believe that the employee might seek to
tamper with or destroy evidence, influence witnesses and/or sway an
investigation into the disciplinary allegation; or

Discipline and grievances at work

* working relationships have severely broken down to the point that there is
a genuine risk to other employees, property, customers or other business
interests if the employee remains in the workplace; or

° the employee is the subject of criminal proceedings which may affect
whether they can do their job.

Suspension can leave individuals feeling prejudged, demotivated and devalued.
It should therefore only be used after very careful consideration. It should
always be made very clear that suspension is not an assumption of guilt and is
not considered a disciplinary sanction. The individual should be reminded and
reassured that a fair procedure will follow in which their point of view will be
listened to and fairly considered.

Some individuals may find it extremely distressing to be told they are being
suspended. This may be the case even if the person does not show any obvious
signs of distress. Employers should bear this in mind in deciding when and how
to communicate a decision about suspension. It is good practice to encourage a
suspended employee to access some immediate support and to offer help to do
this. For example, to offer to contact a colleague, friend or relative of their
choosing to meet them immediately.

Further guidance on suspension is available on the Acas website

Informing the employee

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

If it is decided that there is a disciplinary case to answer, the employee should
be notified of this in writing. This notification should contain sufficient
information about the alleged misconduct or poor performance and its possible
consequences to enable the employee to prepare to answer the case ata
disciplinary meeting.

It would normally be appropriate to provide copies of any written evidence,
which may include any witness statements, with the notification. The notification
should also give details of the time and venue for the disciplinary meeting and
advise of the right to be accompanied at the meeting.

 

As well notifying the nature of the complaint and the right to be accompanied
the employee should also be told about the procedure to be followed. A sample
letter inviting an employee to a meeting is at Appendix 3.

Discipline and grievances at work

The meeting should be held without unreasonable delay whilst allowing the
employee reasonable time to prepare their case.

Employers and employees (and their companions) should make every effort to
attend the meeting. At the meeting the employer should explain the complaint
against the employee and go through the evidence that has been gathered. The
employee should be allowed to set out their case and answer any allegations
that have been made. The employee should also be given a reasonable
opportunity to ask questions, present evidence and call relevant witnesses. They
should also be given an opportunity to raise points about any information
provided by witnesses. Where an employer or employee intends to call relevant
witnesses they should give advance notice that they intend to do this.

 

Preparing for the meeting

You should:

¢ ensure that all the relevant facts are available, such as disciplinary records
and any other relevant documents (for instance absence or sickness
records) and, where appropriate, written statements from witnesses

e where possible arrange for someone who is not involved in the case to
take a note of the meeting and to act as a witness to what was said

e check if there are any special circumstances to be taken into account. For
example, are there personal or other outside issues affecting performance
or conduct?

¢ allow the employee time to prepare his or her case. Copies of any relevant
papers and all witness statements should be made available to the
employee in advance

° be careful when dealing with evidence from a person who wishes to
remain anonymous. In particular, take written statements that give details
of time/place/dates as appropriate, seek corroborative evidence, check
that the person’s motives are genuine and assess the credibility and
weight to be attached to their evidence

* consider what explanations may be offered by the employee, and if
possible check them out beforehand

e if the employee concerned is a trade union representative discuss the case
with a trade union full-time official after obtaining the employee’s
agreement. This is because the action may be seen as an attack on the
union

* arrange a time for the meeting, which should be held as privately as
possible, in a suitable room, and where there will be no interruptions. The
employee may offer a reasonable alternative time, normally within five

19

Discipline and grievances at work

working days of the original date, if their chosen companion cannot
attend. You may also arrange another meeting if an employee fails to
attend through circumstances outside their control, such as illness

 

° try and get a written statement from any witness from outside the
organisation who is not prepared to or is unable to attend the meeting

° allow the employee to call witnesses or submit witness statements

* consider the provision of an interpreter or facilitator if there are
understanding or language difficulties (perhaps a friend of the employee,
or a co-employee). This person may need to attend in addition to the
companion though ideally one person should carry out both roles

* make provision for any reasonable adjustments to accommodate the
needs of a person with a disability

e think about the structure of the meeting and make a list of points you will
wish to cover.

What if an employee repeatedly fails to attend a meeting?

There may be occasions when an employee is repeatedly unable or unwilling to
attend a meeting. This may be for various reasons, including genuine illness or a
refusal to face up to the issue. Employers will need to consider all the facts and
come to a reasonable decision on how to proceed. Considerations may include:

* any rules the organisation has for dealing with failure to attend
disciplinary meetings

e the seriousness of the disciplinary issue under consideration

° the employee’s disciplinary record (including current warnings), general

work record, work experience, position and length of service * medical
opinion on whether the employee is fit to attend the meeting

° how similar cases in the past have been dealt with.

Where an employee continues to be unavailable to attend a meeting the
employer may conclude that a decision will need to be made on the evidence
available. The employee should be informed where this is to be the case. See
also Appendix 4 ‘Dealing with absence’.

 

How should the disciplinary meeting be conducted?

Remember that the point of the meeting is to establish the facts, not catch
people out. The meetings may not proceed in neat, orderly stages but it is good
practice to:

e introduce those present to the employee and explain why they are there

20

274


--- New Page 21 ---
Page number: 21
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

e introduce and explain the role of the accompanying person if present

° explain that the purpose of the meeting is to consider whether disciplinary
action should be taken in accordance with the organisation’s disciplinary
procedure

* explain how the meeting will be conducted.

Statement of the complaint

State precisely what the complaint is and outline the case briefly by going
through the evidence that has been gathered. Ensure that the employee and
their representative or accompanying person are allowed to see any statements
made by witnesses and to question them.

Employee's reply

Give the employee the opportunity to state their case and answer any
allegations that have been made. They should be able to ask questions, present
evidence and call witnesses. The accompanying person may also ask questions
and should be able to confer privately with the employee. Listen carefully and be
prepared to wait in silence for an answer as this can be a constructive way of
encouraging the employee to be more forthcoming.

Establish whether the employee is prepared to accept that they may have done
something wrong or are not performing to the required standard. Then agree the
steps which should be taken to remedy the situation.

If it is not practical for witnesses to attend, consider proceeding if it is clear that
their verbal evidence will not affect the substance of the complaint. Alternatively,
consider an adjournment to allow questions to be put to a witness who cannot
attend in person but who has submitted a witness statement.

General questioning and discussion

You should:

° use this stage to establish all the facts

* ask the employee if they have any explanation for the alleged misconduct
or unsatisfactory performance, or if there are any special circumstances to
be taken into account

° if it becomes clear during this stage that the employee has provided an
adequate explanation or there is no real evidence to support the
allegation, bring the proceedings to a close

° keep the approach formal and polite and encourage the employee to
speak freely with a view to establishing the facts. A properly conducted
disciplinary meeting should be a two-way process. Use questions to clarify
the issues and to check that what has been said is understood. Ask

21

275


--- New Page 22 ---
Page number: 22
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

openended questions, for example, ‘what happened then?’ to get the
broad picture. Ask precise, closed questions requiring a yes/no answer
only when specific information is needed

¢ do not get involved in arguments and do not make personal or humiliating
remarks. Avoid physical contact or gestures which could be misinterpreted
or misconstrued as judgemental.

If new facts emerge, it may be necessary to adjourn the meeting to investigate
them and reconvene the meeting when this has been done.

Summing up

Summarise the main points of the discussion after questioning is completed. This
allows all parties to be reminded of the nature of the offence, the arguments and
evidence put forward and to ensure nothing is missed. Ask the employee if they
have anything further to say. This should help to demonstrate to the employee
that they have been treated reasonably.

Adjournment before decision

Adjourn before a decision is taken about whether a disciplinary penalty is
appropriate. This allows time for reflection and proper consideration. It also
allows for any further checking of any matters raised, particularly if there is any
dispute over facts.

What problems may arise and how should they be handled?

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Where an employee raises a grievance during a disciplinary process the
disciplinary process may be temporarily suspended in order to deal with the
grievance. Where the grievance and disciplinary cases are related, it may be
appropriate to deal with both issues concurrently.

 

When an employee raises a grievance during the meeting it may sometimes be
appropriate to consider stopping the meeting and suspending the disciplinary
procedure - for example when:

° the grievance relates to a conflict of interest that the manager holding the
disciplinary meeting is alleged to have

° bias is alleged in the conduct of the disciplinary meeting

* management have been selective in the evidence they have supplied to
the manager holding the meeting

e there is possible discrimination.

Discipline and grievances at work

It would not be appropriate to suspend the meeting where the employee makes
an invalid point. For example if they mistakenly claim that they have the right to
be legally represented or that a collectively agreed and applicable procedure
does not apply to them because they are not a union member.

It is possible that the disciplinary meeting may not proceed smoothly - people
may be upset or angry. If the employee becomes upset or distressed allow time
for them to regain composure before continuing. If the distress is too great to
continue then adjourn and reconvene at a later date — however, the issues
should not be avoided. Clearly during the meeting there may be some ‘letting off
steam’, and this can be helpful in finding out what has actually happened.
However, abusive language or conduct should not be tolerated.

Allowing a worker to be accompanied

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied by a companion where the
disciplinary meeting could result in:

* a formal warning being issued; or
« the taking of some other disciplinary action; or

e the confirmation of a warning or some other disciplinary action (appeal
hearings).

The statutory right is to be accompanied by a fellow worker, a trade union
representative, or an official employed by a trade union. A trade union
representative who is not an employed official must have been certified by their
union as being competent to accompany a worker. Employers must agree to a
worker’s request to be accompanied by any companion from one of these
categories. Workers may also alter their choice of companion if they wish. As a
matter of good practice, in making their choice workers should bear in mind the
practicalities of the arrangements. For instance, a worker may choose to be
accompanied by a companion who is suitable, willing and available on site rather
than someone from a geographically remote location.

To exercise the statutory right to be accompanied workers must make a
reasonable request. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of each
individual case. A request to be accompanied does not have to be in writing or
within a certain timeframe. However, a worker should provide enough time for
the employer to deal with the companion’s attendance at the meeting. Workers
should also consider how they make their request so that it is clearly
understood, for instance by letting the employer know in advance the name of
the companion where possible and whether they are a fellow worker or trade
union official or representative.

If a worker’s chosen companion will not be available at the time proposed for the
hearing by the employer, the employer must postpone the hearing to a time
proposed by the worker provided that the alternative time is both reasonable
and not more than five working days after the date originally proposed.

Page number: 24
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

The companion should be allowed to address the hearing to put and sum up the
workers case, respond on behalf of the worker to any views expressed at the
meeting and confer with the worker during the hearing. The companion does
not, however, have the right to answer questions on the worker’s behalf,
address the hearing if the worker does not wish it or prevent the employer from
explaining their case.

 

What is the right to be accompanied?

Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied where they are required or
invited by their employer to attend certain disciplinary meetings. The chosen
companion may be a fellow worker, a trade union representative, or an official
employed by a trade union. A trade union representative who is not an employed
official must have been certified by their union as being competent to
accompany a worker. Workers must make a reasonable request to their
employer to be accompanied.

When does the right apply?

Workers have the right to be accompanied at disciplinary hearings that could
result in:

* a formal warning being issued to a worker (ie a warning that will be
placed on the worker’s record)

° the taking of some other disciplinary action (such as suspension without
pay, demotion or dismissal) or other action

° the confirmation of a warning or some other disciplinary action (ie
following an appeal hearing).

Informal discussions, counselling sessions or disciplinary investigatory meetings
do not attract the right to be accompanied. Meetings to investigate a disciplinary
issue are not disciplinary hearings. If it becomes apparent that formal
disciplinary action may be needed then this should be dealt with at a formal
hearing at which the statutory right to be accompanied will apply.

What is a reasonable request?

Whether a request for a companion is reasonable will depend on the
circumstances of the individual case and, ultimately, it is a matter for the courts
and tribunals to decide if disputed. However, a worker should provide enough
time for the employer to deal with the companion’s attendance at the meeting.

Workers should also consider how they make their request so that it is clearly
understood, for instance by letting the employer know in advance the name of
the companion where possible and whether they are a fellow worker or trade
union official or representative.

Discipline and grievances at work

The companion

The companion may be:

° a fellow worker (i.e. another of the employer’s workers)
° an official employed by a trade union

* aworkplace trade union representative, as long as they have been
reasonably certified in writing by their union as having experience of, or
having received training in, acting as a worker’s companion at disciplinary
or grievance hearings. Certification may take the form of a card or letter.

Employers are free, but are not obliged, to allow workers to be accompanied by
a companion who does not fall within the above categories. Some workers may
have a contractual right to be accompanied by persons other than those listed
above (for instance a professional support body, partner, spouse or legal
representative).

Reasonable adjustment may be needed for a worker with a disability (and
possibly for their companion if they are disabled). For example the provision of a
support worker or advocate with knowledge of the disability and its effects.

Workers may ask an official from any trade union to accompany them at a
disciplinary or grievance hearing, regardless of whether or not they are a
member or the union is recognised.

Fellow workers or trade union officials do not have to accept a request to
accompany a worker, and they should not be pressurised to do so.

Trade unions should ensure that their officials are trained in the role of acting as
a worker's companion. Even when a trade union official has experience of acting
in the role, there may still be a need for periodic refresher training. Employers
should consider allowing time off for this training.

A worker who has agreed to accompany a colleague employed by the same
employer is entitled to take a reasonable amount of paid time off to fulfil that
responsibility. This should cover the hearing and it is also good practice to allow
time for the companion to familiarise themselves with the case and confer with
the worker before and after the hearing.

A lay trade union official is permitted to take a reasonable amount of paid time
off to accompany a worker at a hearing, as long as the worker is employed by
the same employer. In cases where a lay official agrees to accompany a worker
employed by another organisation, time off is a matter for agreement by the
parties concerned.

Applying the right

The employer should allow a companion to have a say about the date and time
of a hearing. If the companion cannot attend on a proposed date, the law on the
right of accompaniment provides that the worker has a right to suggest an

25

279

Page number: 26
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

alternative time and date so long as it is reasonable and it is not more than five
working days after the original date.

Employers may, however, wish to allow more time than this for a re-arranged
meeting, particularly in cases that might result in dismissal. An employer must
always act fairly in order to avoid a finding of unfair dismissal. Where there is a
request to postpone a hearing for more than five working days because a trade
union representative or other companion is not available, it may be fair to allow
the postponement if it does not cause unreasonable delay. The employer should
consider the facts and decide what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

Before the hearing takes place, the worker should tell the employer who they
have chosen as a companion. In certain circumstances (for instance when the
companion is an official of a non-recognised trade union) it can be helpful for the
companion and employer to make contact before the hearing.

The companion must be allowed to address the hearing in order to:

e put the worker’s case
* sum up the worker’s case

* respond on the worker’s behalf to any view expressed at the hearing.

The companion must also be allowed to confer with the worker during the
hearing. It is good practice to allow the companion to participate as fully as
possible in the hearing, including asking witnesses questions. The employer is,
however, not legally required to permit the companion to answer questions on
the worker’s behalf, or to address the hearing if the worker does not wish it, or
to prevent the employer from explaining their case.

Workers whose employers fail to comply with a reasonable request to be
accompanied may present a complaint to an employment tribunal. Workers may
also complain to a tribunal if employers fail to re-arrange a hearing to a
reasonable date proposed by the worker when a companion cannot attend on
the date originally proposed.

It is unlawful to disadvantage workers for using their right to be accompanied or
for being companions. This could lead to a claim to an employment tribunal.

Taking action after the disciplinary meeting

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

After the meeting decide whether or not disciplinary or any other action is
justified and inform the employee accordingly in writing.

Where misconduct is confirmed or the employee is found to be performing
unsatisfactorily it is usual to give the employee a written warning. A further act
of misconduct or failure to improve performance within a set period would
normally result in a final written warning.

26

Page number: 27
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

If an employee’s first misconduct or unsatisfactory performance is sufficiently
serious, it may be appropriate to move directly to a final written warning. This
might occur where the employee’s actions have had, or are liable to have, a
serious or harmful impact on the organisation.

A first or final written warning should set out the nature of the misconduct or
poor performance and the change in behaviour or improvement in performance
required (with timescale). The employee should be told how long the warning
will remain current. The employee should be informed of the consequences of
further misconduct, or failure to improve performance, within the set period
following a final warning. For instance that it may result in dismissal or some
other contractual penalty such as demotion or loss of seniority.

A decision to dismiss should only be taken by a manager who has the authority
to do so. The employee should be informed as soon as possible of the reasons
for the dismissal, the date on which the employment contract will end, the
appropriate period of notice and their right of appeal.

Some acts, termed gross misconduct, are so serious in themselves or have such
serious consequences that they may call for dismissal without notice for a first
offence. But a fair disciplinary process should always be followed before
dismissing for gross misconduct.

Disciplinary rules should give examples of acts which the employer regards as
acts of gross misconduct. These may vary according to the nature of the
organisation and what it does, but might include things such as theft or fraud,
physical violence, gross negligence or serious insubordination.

Where an employee is persistently unable or unwilling to attend a disciplinary
meeting without good cause the employer should make a decision on the
evidence available.

 

What should be considered before deciding any disciplinary penalty?

When deciding whether a disciplinary penalty is appropriate and what form it
should take, consideration should be given to:

°¢ whether the rules of the organisation indicate what the likely penalty will
be as a result of the particular misconduct

e the penalty imposed in similar cases in the past

e whether standards of other employees are acceptable, and that this
employee is not being unfairly singled out

° the employee’s disciplinary record (including current warnings), general
work record, work experience, position and length of service

* any special circumstances which might make it appropriate to adjust the
severity of the penalty

° whether the proposed penalty is reasonable in view of all the
circumstances

27

281


--- New Page 28 ---
Page number: 28
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

¢ whether any training, additional support or adjustments to the employee’s
work are necessary.

It should be clear what the normal organisational practice is for dealing with the
kind of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance under consideration. This does
not mean that similar offences will always call for the same disciplinary action:
each case must be looked at on its own merits and any relevant circumstances
taken into account. Such relevant circumstances may include health or domestic
problems, provocation, justifiable ignorance of the rule or standard involved, or
inconsistent treatment in the past.

If guidance is needed on formal disciplinary action, seek advice, where possible,
from someone who will not be involved in hearing any potential appeal. Call the
Acas helpline on 0300 123 1100 (Open Monday - Friday 8am-6pm) to talk to
one of our advisers.

Imposing the disciplinary penalty
First formal action — unsatisfactory performance

In cases of unsatisfactory performance an employee should be given an
‘improvement note’, setting out:

e the performance problem

e the improvement that is required

° the timescale for achieving this improvement
* areview date

* any support, including any training, that the employer will provide to
assist the employee.

The employee should be informed that the note represents the first stage of a

formal procedure and is equivalent to a first written warning and that failure to
improve could lead to a final written warning and, ultimately, dismissal. A copy
of the note should be kept and used as the basis for monitoring and reviewing

performance over a specified period (eg, six months).

If an employee’s unsatisfactory performance - or its continuance - is sufficiently
serious, for example because it is having, or is likely to have, a serious harmful
effect on the organisation, it may be justifiable to move directly to a final written
warning.

 

Discipline in practice: Example 2

A member of staff in accounts makes a number of mistakes on invoices to
customers. You bring the mistakes to his attention, make sure he has had the
right training and impress on him the need for accuracy, but the mistakes
continue. You invite him to a disciplinary meeting and inform him of his right to
be accompanied by a colleague or employee representative. At the meeting he

28

282


--- New Page 29 ---
Page number: 29
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

does not give a satisfactory explanation for the mistakes so you decide to issue
an improvement note setting out: the problem, the improvement required, the

timescale for improvement, the support available and a review date. You inform
him that a failure to improve may lead to a final written warning.

 

First formal action — misconduct

In cases of misconduct, employees should be given a written warning setting out
the nature of the misconduct and the change in behaviour required.

The warning should also inform the employee that a final written warning may
be considered if there is further misconduct. A record of the warning should be
kept, but it should be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after a specified
period (eg, six months).

 

Discipline in practice: Example 3
An employee in a small firm makes a series of promises in letters to one of your
key customers guaranteeing impossible delivery dates. The customer is upset at

your firm’s failure to meet delivery dates and threatens to take his business
elsewhere.

You are the owner of the business and carry out an investigation and invite the
employee to a disciplinary meeting. You inform her of her right to be
accompanied by a colleague or employee representative.

Example outcome of meeting

At the meeting the employee does not give a satisfactory explanation for the
promises made and admits that her training covered the importance of agreeing
realistic delivery dates with her manager. During your investigation, her team
leader and section manager told you they had stressed to the employee the
importance of agreeing delivery dates with them before informing the customer.
In view of the seriousness of the conduct and the possible impact on the
business, you issue the employee with a final written warning. You inform the
employee that a repeat of such conduct may lead to dismissal and of her right to
appeal.

Example outcome of meeting in different circumstances

At the meeting, the employee reveals that her team leader would not let her
attend training as the section was too busy. Subsequently the team leader was
absent sick and the employee asked the section manager for help with setting
delivery dates. The manager said he was too busy and told the employee to ‘use
her initiative’. Your other investigations support the employee’s explanation. You
inform the employee that you will not be taking disciplinary action and will make
arrangements for her to be properly trained. You decide to carry out a review of
general management standards on supervision and training.

 

Final written warning

If the employee has a current warning about conduct or performance then
further misconduct or unsatisfactory performance (whichever is relevant) may

29

283


--- New Page 30 ---
Page number: 30
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

warrant a final written warning. This may also be the case where ‘first offence’
misconduct is sufficiently serious, but would not justify dismissal. Such a
warning should normally remain current for a specified period, for example, 12
months, and contain a statement that further misconduct or unsatisfactory
performance may lead to dismissal.

Dismissal or other sanction

If the employee has received a final written warning, further misconduct or
unsatisfactory performance may warrant dismissal. Alternatively the contract
may allow for a different disciplinary penalty instead. Such a penalty may
include disciplinary transfer, disciplinary suspension without pay (although see
the considerations on suspension), demotion, loss of seniority or loss of
increment. These sanctions may only be applied if allowed for in the employee’s
contract or with the employee’s agreement.

 

Any penalty should be confirmed in writing, and the procedure and time limits
for appeal set out clearly.

There may be occasions when, depending on the seriousness of the misconduct
involved, it will be appropriate to consider dismissal without notice (see below).

Dismissal with notice

Employees should only be dismissed if, despite warnings, conduct or
performance does not improve to the required level within the specified time
period. Dismissal must be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.

Unless the employee is being dismissed for reasons of gross misconduct, he or
she should receive the appropriate period of notice or payment in lieu of notice.

Dismissal without notice

Employers should give all employees a clear indication of the type of misconduct
which, in the light of the requirements of the employer’s business, will warrant
dismissal without the normal period of notice or pay in lieu of notice. So far as
possible the types of offences which fall into this category of ‘gross misconduct’
should be clearly specified in the rules, although such a list cannot normally be
exhaustive.

What is gross misconduct?

Gross misconduct is generally seen as misconduct serious enough to overturn
the contract between the employer and the employee thus justifying summary
dismissal. Acts which constitute gross misconduct must be very serious and are
best determined by organisations in the light of their own particular
circumstances. However, examples of gross misconduct might include:

e theft or fraud

° physical violence or bullying

* serious incapability at work brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs
* causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence

° serious breach of health and safety rules

° aserious breach of confidence.

If an employer considers an employee guilty of gross misconduct and thus liable
for summary dismissal, it is still important to follow a fair procedure as for any
other disciplinary offence. This will include establishing the facts of the case
before taking any action, holding a meeting with the employee and allowing the
employee the right of appeal. It should be made clear to the employee that
dismissal is a possibility.

A short period of suspension with full pay to help establish the facts or to allow
tempers to cool may be helpful. However, such a period of suspension should
only be imposed after careful consideration and should be kept under review. It
should be made clear to the employee that the suspension is not a disciplinary
action and does not involve any prejudgement.

 

 

Discipline in practice: Example 4

A member of your telephone sales team has been to lunch to celebrate success
in an exam. He returns from lunch in a very merry mood, is slurring his speech
and is evidently not fit to carry out his duties. You decide to send him home and
invite him in writing to a disciplinary meeting setting out his alleged behaviour of
gross misconduct for which he could be dismissed. Your letter includes
information about his right to be accompanied by a colleague or employee
representative.

At the meeting he admits he had too much to drink, is very apologetic and
promises that such a thing will not happen again. He is one of your most valued
members of staff and has an exemplary record over his 10 years’ service with
you. You know that being unfit for work because of excessive alcohol is listed in
your company rules as gross misconduct. In view of the circumstances and the
employee’s record, however, you decide not to dismiss him but give him a final
written warning. You inform the employee of his right to appeal.

Discipline and grievances at work

How should the employee be informed of the disciplinary decision?

Details of any disciplinary action should be given in writing to the employee as
soon as the decision is made. See example letters at Appendix 3. A copy of the
notification should be retained by the employer. The written notification should
specify:

 

e the nature of the misconduct

* any period of time given for improvement and the improvement expected
e the disciplinary penalty and, where appropriate, how long it will last

° the likely consequences of further misconduct

° the timescale for lodging an appeal and how it should be made.

The organisation may wish to require the employee to acknowledge receipt of
the written notification.

Written reasons for dismissal

Employees with two years’ service or more have the right to request a ‘written
statement of reasons for dismissal’. Employers are required by law to comply
within 14 days of the request being made, unless it is not reasonably
practicable. It is good practice to give written reasons for all dismissals.

A woman who is dismissed during pregnancy or maternity or adoption leave is
automatically entitled to the written statement without having to request it and
irrespective of length of service.

The written statement can be used in evidence in any subsequent employment
tribunal proceedings, for example, in relation to a complaint of unfair dismissal.

Time limits for warnings

Except in agreed special circumstances, any disciplinary action taken should be
disregarded for disciplinary purposes after a specified period of satisfactory
conduct or performance. This period should be established clearly when the
disciplinary procedure is being drawn up. A decision to dismiss should not be
based on an expired warning but the fact that there is an expired warning may
explain why the employer does not substitute a lesser sanction.

Normal practice is for different types of warnings to remain in force for different
periods. For example, a first written warning might be valid for up to six months
while a final written warning may remain in force for 12 months (or more in
exceptional circumstances). Warnings should cease to be ‘live’ following the
specified period of satisfactory conduct.

There may be occasions where an employee’s conduct is satisfactory throughout
the period the warning is in force, only to lapse very soon thereafter. Where a

Discipline and grievances at work

pattern emerges and/or there is evidence of abuse, the employee’s disciplinary
record should be borne in mind in deciding how long any warning should last.

Provide employees with an opportunity to appeal

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Where an employee feels that disciplinary action taken against them is wrong or
unjust they should appeal against the decision. Appeals should be heard without
unreasonable delay and ideally at an agreed time and place. Employees should
let employers know the grounds for their appeal in writing.

The appeal should be dealt with impartially and, wherever possible, by a
manager who has not previously been involved in the case.

Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied at appeal hearings.

Employees should be informed in writing of the results of the appeal hearing as
soon as possible.

 

The opportunity to appeal against a disciplinary decision is essential to natural
justice. Appeals may be raised by employees on any number of grounds, for
instance new evidence, undue severity or inconsistency of the penalty. The
appeal may either be a review of the disciplinary sanction or a re-hearing,
depending on the grounds of the appeal.

An appeal must never be used as an opportunity to punish the employee for
appealing the original decision, and it should not result in any increase in penalty
as this may deter individuals from appealing.

What should an appeals procedure contain?

It should:

° specify a time-limit within which the appeal should be lodged (five working
days is commonly felt appropriate although this may be extended in
particular circumstances)

° provide for appeals to be dealt with speedily, particularly those involving
suspension or dismissal

e wherever possible provide for the appeal to be heard by someone senior
in authority to the person who took the disciplinary decision and, if
possible, someone who was not involved in the original meeting or
decision

° spell out what action may be taken by those hearing the appeal

° set out the right to be accompanied at any appeal meeting

33

287

Page number: 34
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

° provide that the employee, or a companion if the employee so wishes, has
an opportunity to comment on any new evidence arising during the appeal
before any decision is taken.

 

Small organisations

In small organisations, even if there is no more senior manager available,
another manager should, if possible, hear the appeal. If this is not possible
consider whether the owner or, in the case of a charity, the board of trustees,
should hear the appeal. Whoever hears the appeal should consider it impartially.

How should an appeal hearing be conducted? Before the appeal ensure that the
individual knows when and where it is to be held, and of their statutory right to
be accompanied. Hold the meeting in a place which will be free from
interruptions. Make sure the relevant records and notes of the original meeting
are available for all concerned. See sample letters at Appendix 3.

 

 

At the meeting

You should:

e introduce those present to each other, explaining their presence if
necessary

° explain the purpose of the meeting, how it will be conducted, and the
powers the person/people hearing the appeal have

° ask the employee why he or she is appealing

° pay particular attention to any new evidence that has been introduced,
and ensure the employee has the opportunity to comment on it

* once the relevant issues have been thoroughly explored, summarise the
facts and call an adjournment to consider the decision

e change a previous decision if it becomes apparent that it was not soundly
based —- such action does not undermine authority but rather makes clear
the independent nature of the appeal. If the decision is overturned
consider whether training for managers needs to be improved, if rules
need clarification, or if there are other implications to be considered

° inform the employee of the results of the appeal and the reasons for the
decision and confirm it in writing. Make it clear, if this is the case, that this
decision is final. See sample letters at Appendix 3.

Discipline and grievances at work

Where disciplinary action is being considered against an employee who is a trade
union representative the normal disciplinary procedure should be followed.
Depending on the circumstances, however, it is advisable to discuss the matter
at an early stage with an official employed by the union, after obtaining the
employee’s agreement.

If an employee is charged with, or convicted of a criminal offence this is not
normally in itself reason for disciplinary action. Consideration needs to be given
to what effect the charge or conviction has on the employee’s suitability to do
the job and their relationship with their employer, work colleagues and
customers.

 

Trade union officials

Although normal disciplinary standards apply to their conduct as employees,
disciplinary action against a trade union representative can be construed as an
attack on the union if not handled carefully (see Preparing for the meeting).

 

Criminal charges or convictions

An employee should not be dismissed or otherwise disciplined solely because he
or she has been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence. The question to
be asked in such cases is whether the employee’s conduct or conviction merits
action because of its employment implications.

Where it is thought the conduct may warrant disciplinary action the following
guidance should be borne in mind:

° the employer should investigate the facts as far as possible, come to a
view about them and consider whether the conduct is sufficiently serious
to warrant instituting the disciplinary procedure

e where the conduct requires prompt attention the employer need not await
the outcome of the criminal prosecution before taking fair and reasonable
action

e where the police are called in they should not be asked to conduct any
investigation on behalf of the employer, nor should they be present at any
meeting or disciplinary meeting.

In some cases the nature of the alleged offence may not justify disciplinary
action — for example, off-duty conduct which has no bearing on employment -
but the employee may not be available for work because he or she is in custody
or on remand. In these cases employers should decide whether, in the light of
the needs of the organisation, the employee’s job can be held open. Where a
criminal conviction leads, for example, to the loss of a licence so that continued
employment in a particular job would be illegal, employers should consider
whether alternative work is appropriate and available.

Where an employee, charged with or convicted of a criminal offence, refuses or
is unable to cooperate with the employer’s disciplinary investigations and

35

Page number: 36
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

proceedings, this should not deter an employer from taking action. The
employee should be advised in writing that unless further information is
provided, a disciplinary decision will be taken on the basis of the information
available and could result in dismissal.

Where there is little likelihood of an employee returning to employment, it may
be argued that the contract of employment has been terminated through
‘frustration’. In law, frustration occurs when, without the fault of either party,
some event, which was not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the contract,
renders future performance of the contract either impossible or something
radically different from what was contemplated originally. This is normally
accepted by the courts only where the frustrating event renders all performance
of the employment contract clearly impossible. Legal advice should be sought if
it is thought frustration of the employment contract has occurred. It is normally
better for the employer to take disciplinary action.

An employee who has been charged with, or convicted of, a criminal offence may
become unacceptable to colleagues, resulting in workforce pressure to dismiss or
even threats of industrial action. Employers should bear in mind that they may
have to justify the reasonableness of any decision to dismiss and that an
employment tribunal will ignore threats of, and actual, industrial action when
determining the fairness of a decision (Section 107, Employment Rights Act
1996). Employers should consider all relevant factors, not just disruption to
production, before reaching a reasonable decision.

Use of external consultants

In some instances employers may wish to bring in external consultants to carry
out an investigation. Employers will still be responsible for any inappropriate or
discriminatory behaviour if the investigation is carried out by consultants. Make
arrangements for the investigation to be overseen by a representative of
management. Make sure that the consultants follow the organisation’s
disciplinary policies and procedures and deal with the case fairly in accordance
with the Acas Code of Practice.

Employees to whom the full procedure is not immediately available

It may be sensible to arrange time off with pay so that employees who are in
isolated locations or on nightshifts can attend a disciplinary meeting on the main
site in normal working hours. Alternatively, if a number of witnesses need to
attend it may be better to hold the disciplinary meeting on the nightshift or at
the particular location.

Grievances: keys to handling grievances in the
workplace

Resolve grievances informally

In organisations where managers have an open policy for communication and
consultation, problems and concerns are often raised and settled as a matter of
course.

Employees should aim to settle most grievances informally with their line
manager. Many problems can be raised and settled during the course of
everyday working relationships. This also allows for problems to be settled
quickly.

In cases where the line manager is the subject of the grievance, individuals
should be able to discuss their concerns with another manager or another
appropriate person.

In some cases outside help such as an independent mediator can help resolve
problems especially those involving working relationships.

 

Developing rules and procedures

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Fairness and transparency are promoted by developing and using rules and
procedures for handling disciplinary and grievance situations. These should be
set down in writing, be specific and clear. Employees and, where appropriate,
their representatives should be involved in the development of rules and
procedures. It is also important to help employees and managers understand
what the rules and procedures are, where they can be found and how they are
to be used.

 

What is a grievance and why have a procedure?

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Grievances are concerns, problems or complaints that employees raise with their
employers.

 

Anybody working in an organisation may, at some time, have problems or
concerns about their work, working conditions or relationships with colleagues
that they wish to talk about with management. They want the grievance to be
addressed, and if possible, resolved.

Discipline and grievances at work

It is also clearly in management’s interests to resolve problems before they can
develop into major difficulties for all concerned.

Issues that may cause grievances include:

* terms and conditions of employment
e health and safety

° work relations

° bullying and harassment

* new working practices

° working environment

* organisational change

° discrimination.

Grievances may occur at all levels and the Acas Code of Practice, and this
guidance, applies equally to management and employees.

A written procedure can help clarify the process and help to ensure that
employees are aware of their rights such as to be accompanied at grievance
meetings. Some organisations use, or may wish to use, external mediators to
help resolve grievances. Where this is the case the procedure should explain how
and when mediators may be used.

 

 

Employees might raise issues about matters not entirely within the control of the
organisation, such as client or customer relationships (for instance where an
employee is working on another employer's site). These should be treated in the
same way as grievances within the organisation, with the employer/manager
investigating as far as possible and taking action if required. The organisation
should make it very clear to any third party that grievances are taken seriously
and action will be taken to protect their employees.

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

The provisions of this Code do not apply to grievances raised on behalf of two or
more employees by a representative of a recognised trade union or other
appropriate workplace representative. These grievances should be handled in
accordance with the organisation’s collective grievance process.

 

Occasionally a collective grievance may arise where a number of people have the
same grievance at the same time. If there is a grievance which applies to more
than one person this should be resolved in accordance with the organisation’s
collective grievance process — where one exists.

Grievances about fellow employees

Employees may complain that that they have been bullied, harassed or
discriminated against by another employee or may complain about another

Discipline and grievances at work

employee’s attitude, capability for the job or even personal habits or personal
hygiene.

Employers must deal with these cases carefully. Conversations should be
handled in a way that is sensitive to the circumstances and the needs of the
individuals concerned. It is important not to make assumptions at the outset
about the facts of the case.

Where a grievance about a fellow employee is raised informally, after listening to
the employee who has made the complaint to understand their concern, the next
step should generally be to talk privately to the person complained about. This
may help clarify the situation and can help move things forward towards a
resolution. Alternatively, if those involved are willing, an independent mediator
may be able to help in some circumstances.

 

Employers should bear in mind that it is not only the individual who has raised
the grievance who may be distressed, but also the person complained about.
Care should be taken that any informal discussion with them remains
nonjudgmental. In particular, the discussion should not turn into a disciplinary
hearing.

If a formal grievance about a fellow employee is raised, the guidance outlined
below on handling formal grievances will apply.

 

Training for dealing with grievances

Management and employee representatives who may be involved in grievance
matters should be trained for the task.

For handling informal grievances effectively, good line management skills are
essential. Managers may benefit from training aimed at helping them become
more confident and emotionally intelligent in dealing with people, as well as
developing skills in handling difficult conversations.

Those who may be involved in handling formal grievances should be familiar with
the employer’s grievance procedure, and know how to conduct or represent at
grievance hearings. Consideration might be given to training managers and
employee representatives jointly on this. For information about suitable training
go to https://www.acas.org.uk/training.

 

Keeping written records
What records should be kept?

The foreword to the Code of Practice advises employers to keep a written record
of any disciplinary or grievances cases they deal with.

Records should include:

e the nature of the grievance

39

293


--- New Page 40 ---
Page number: 40
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

¢ what was decided and actions taken
e the reason for the actions

e whether an appeal was lodged

° the outcome of the appeal

° any subsequent developments.

Records should be treated as confidential and be kept no longer than necessary
in accordance with the data protection principles set out in the Data Protection
Act 2018. This Act also gives individuals the right to request and have access to
certain personal data stored about them. See Appendix 5 for further information.

 

Copies of meeting records should be given to the employee including copies of
any formal minutes that may have been taken. In certain circumstances (for
example to protect a witness) the employer might withhold some information.

Dealing with formal grievances

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Where some form of formal action is needed, what action is reasonable or
justified will depend on all the circumstances of the particular case. Employment
tribunals will take the size and resources of an employer into account when
deciding on relevant cases and it may sometimes not be practicable for all
employers to take all of the steps set out in this Code.

That said, whenever a disciplinary or grievance process is being followed it is
important to deal with issues fairly. There are a number of elements to this:

« Employers and employees should raise and deal with issues promptly and
should not unreasonably delay meetings, decisions or confirmation of those
decisions.

* Employers and employees should act consistently.

« Employers should carry out any necessary investigations, to establish the
facts of the case.

« Employers should inform employees of the basis of the problem and give
them an opportunity to put their case in response before any decisions are
made.

* Employers should allow employees to be accompanied at any formal
disciplinary or grievance meeting.

« Employers should allow an employee to appeal against any formal decision
made.

Discipline and grievances at work

The following pages give detailed guidance on handling formal grievances.
Always bear in mind the need for fairness when following procedures, taking
account of the elements from the Acas Code of Practice reproduced above.

A grievance process can be stressful for everyone involved. Different individuals
will respond differently to stressful situations. Sometimes a process may cause
extreme distress and even impact on a person’s mental health. Employers
should consider how they can provide support to minimise the risk of this
happening.

Where there are any signs of this happening to anyone involved in the process,
employers should consider whether the process can be adjusted in some way,
such as by allowing the individual to be accompanied at a grievance meeting by
a support worker or advocate from outside the organisation who has knowledge
of the individual’s mental health condition and its effects.

In some cases, it might be appropriate for an employer, with the agreement and
involvement of the individual, to seek professional medical help or guidance as
to how the grievance process can proceed fairly. If there are clear and repeated
signs of distress, the employer should encourage the individual to use an
employee assistance programme, where one is available, or consider suggesting
that the individual seeks advice from a GP. It is important to address this issue
early to avoid it escalating.

If someone has an existing mental health condition which they have previously
disclosed as a disability, the employer must make reasonable adjustments to the
process.

Employers may also wish to consider training to equip managers with the skills
needed to recognise the signs and symptoms of someone whose mental health
may be adversely affected by a grievance process.

Let the employer know the nature of the grievance

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

If it is not possible to resolve a grievance informally employees should raise the
matter formally and without unreasonable delay with a manager who is not the
subject of the grievance. This should be done in writing and should set out the
nature of the grievance.

 

Where a grievance is serious or an employee has attempted to raise a problem
informally without success, the employee should raise it formally with
management in writing.

Where employees have difficulty expressing themselves because of language or
other difficulties they may like to seek help from trade union or other employee
representatives or from colleagues.

Discipline and grievances at work

When stating their grievance, employees should stick to the facts and avoid
language which may be considered insulting or abusive.

Where the grievance is against the line manager the employee may approach
another manager or raise the issue with their HR department if there is one. It is
helpful if the grievance procedure sets out who the individual should approach in
these circumstances.

In small firms run by an owner/manager there will be no alternative manager to
raise a grievance with. It is in the interests of such employers to make it clear
that they will treat all grievances fairly and objectively even if the grievance is
about something they have said or done.

Holding a grievance meeting

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Employers should arrange for a formal meeting to be held without unreasonable
delay after a grievance is received.

Employers, employees and their companions should make every effort to attend
the meeting. Employees should be allowed to explain their grievance and how
they think it should be resolved. Consideration should be given to adjourning the
meeting for any investigation that may be necessary.

 

What is a grievance meeting?

In general terms a grievance meeting deals with any grievance raised by an
employee. For the purposes of the legal right to be accompanied, a grievance
meeting is defined as a meeting where an employer deals with a complaint about
a ‘duty owed by them to a worker’.

 

Preparing for the meeting

Managers should:

* arrange a meeting, ideally within five working days, in private where there
will not be interruptions

* consider arranging for someone who is not involved in the case to take a
note of the meeting and to act as a witness to what was said

* consider whether similar grievances have been raised before, how they
have been resolved, and any follow-up action that has been necessary.
This allows consistency of treatment

* consider arranging for an interpreter where the employee has difficulty
speaking English

Discipline and grievances at work

* consider whether any reasonable adjustments are necessary for a person
who is disabled and/or their companion

¢ consider whether to offer independent mediation.

 

Conduct of the meeting

Managers should:

* remember that a grievance hearing is not the same as a disciplinary
hearing, and is an occasion when discussion and dialogue may lead to an
amicable solution

* make introductions as necessary

* remain impartial and objective at all times

e invite the employee to re-state their grievance and how they would like to
see it resolved

* put care and thought into resolving grievances. They are not normally
issues calling for snap decisions, and the employee may have been
holding the grievance for a long time. Make allowances for any reasonable
‘letting off steam’ if the employee is under stress

* consider adjourning the meeting if it is necessary to investigate any
statements made or new facts which arise

* sum up the main points

° tell the employee when they might reasonably expect a response if one
cannot be made at the time, bearing in mind the time limits set out in the
organisation’s procedure. If there is a subsequent delay in the anticipated
timescale for a response, for example due to the need to investigate
matters, the employee should also be informed of this.

Be calm, fair and follow the procedure

In smaller organisations, grievances can sometimes be taken as personal
criticism —- employers should be careful to hear any grievance in a calm and
objective manner, consider it impartially and be fair to the employee in seeking
a resolution of the problem. Following the grievance procedure can make this
easier.

 

Grievances in practice: an example

You are the owner of a small firm. An employee has been complaining that she is
being given too much work and can’t complete it in time. You have told the
employee that her predecessor had no problem completing the same amount of

Discipline and grievances at work

work and that things will get easier with experience. The employee is not happy
and puts her grievance to you in writing.

You invite the employee to a meeting to discuss the grievance and inform her of
her right to be accompanied. At the meeting you discover that the employee is
working on a different computer from her predecessor. The computer is slower
and uses an old version of the software required to carry out the work. You
agree to upgrade the software, provide training and to review progress in a
month. You confirm what was agreed in writing and inform the employee of her
right to an appeal meeting if she feels her grievance has not been satisfactorily
resolved.

 

Allowing a worker to be accompanied at the grievance meeting

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied by a companion at a
grievance meeting which deals with a complaint about a duty owed by the
employer to the worker. So this would apply where the complaint is, for
example, that the employer is not honouring the worker’s contract, or is in
breach of legislation.

The statutory right is to be accompanied by a fellow worker, a trade union
representative, or an official employed by a trade union. A trade union
representative who is not an employed official must have been certified by their
union as being competent to accompany a worker. Employers must agree to a
worker’s request to be accompanied by any companion from one of these
categories. Workers may also alter their choice of companion if they wish. As a
matter of good practice, in making their choice workers should bear in mind the
practicalities of the arrangements. For instance, a worker may choose to be
accompanied by a companion who is suitable, willing and available on site rather
than someone from a geographically remote location.

To exercise the statutory right to be accompanied workers must make a
reasonable request. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of each
individual case. A request to be accompanied does not have to be in writing or
within a certain timeframe. However, a worker should provide enough time for
the employer to deal with the companion’s attendance at the meeting. Workers
should also consider how they make their request so that it is clearly
understood, for instance by letting the employer know in advance the name of
the companion where possible and whether they are a fellow worker or trade
union official or representative.

If a worker’s chosen companion will not be available at the time proposed for the
hearing by the employer, the employer must postpone the hearing to a time
proposed by the worker provided that the alternative time is both reasonable
and not more than five working days after the date originally proposed.

The companion should be allowed to address the hearing to put and sum up the
worker’s case, respond on behalf of the worker to any views expressed at the
meeting and confer with the worker during the hearing. The companion does not

Discipline and grievances at work

however have the right to answer questions on the workers behalf, address the
hearing if the worker does not wish it or prevent the employer from explaining
their case.

 

When do workers have the right to be accompanied?

A worker who raises a formal grievance about a duty owed to them by their
employer has a right to be accompanied at a grievance hearing. This includes
any meeting held with them to hear about, gather facts about, discuss, consider
or resolve their grievance.

An employer’s duties to a worker include the employer’s legal and contractual
obligations to the worker. In grievances raised about other types of issues the
statutory right of accompaniment may not apply.

For instance, an individual is unlikely to have the statutory right to
accompaniment at a meeting to consider a request for a pay rise, unless there is
a specific contractual right to a pay increase, or their request raises an issue
about an employer’s legal obligations, such as payment of the National Minimum
Wage or the law on equal pay.

Equally, as most employers will be under no duty to provide their workers with
car parking facilities, usually there will be no statutory right to be accompanied
at a meeting held to hear a grievance about such facilities. However, if a worker
were disabled and needed a car to get to and from work, they would have a
statutory right to a companion at a grievance meeting if their complaint about
parking facilities concerned the employer’s legal duties to the worker under the
Equality Act 2010.

Similarly, as employers have a general duty of care to their workers under
common law, a worker who raises a formal grievance about being bullied or
harassed by a fellow worker will have the statutory right to a companion at a
grievance hearing about the complaint.

Even where the statutory right to accompaniment does not apply, it is generally
good practice to allow workers who raise a grievance to be accompanied at any
formal grievance hearing.

The statutory right to accompaniment applies to the worker who has raised the
grievance. However, it may be appropriate in some circumstances to allow other
individuals to be accompanied at grievance hearings. For instance, where a
formal grievance is raised about a fellow worker, such as a complaint about
bullying or harassment, the person complained about should also be allowed to
be accompanied, by a fellow employee or trade union representative of their
choice, at grievance meetings that involve them. In such cases, the person
complained about should also be allowed to see relevant evidence and copies of
any witness statements, and given reasonable time to share these with their
chosen companion, so that they can fairly prepare for the grievance meeting.

Discipline and grievances at work

What is a reasonable request?

Whether a request for a companion is reasonable will depend on the
circumstances of the individual case and, ultimately, it is a matter for the courts
and tribunals to decide if disputed. However, a worker should provide enough
time for the employer to deal with the companion’s attendance at the meeting.

Workers should also consider how they make their request so that it is clearly
understood, for instance by letting the employer know in advance the name of
the companion where possible and whether they are a fellow worker or trade
union official or representative.

The companion

The companion may be:

° a fellow worker (ie another of the employer’s workers)
° an official employed by a trade union

* aworkplace trade union representative, as long as they have been
reasonably certified in writing by their union as having experience of, or
having received training in, acting as a worker’s companion at disciplinary
or grievance hearings. Certification may take the form of a card or letter.

Employers are free, but are not obliged, to allow workers to be accompanied by
a companion who does not fall within the above categories. Some workers may
have a contractual right to be accompanied by persons other than those listed
above (for instance a professional support body, partner, spouse or legal
representative).

Reasonable adjustment may be needed for a worker with a disability (and
possibly for their companion if they are disabled). For example the provision of a
support worker or advocate with knowledge of the disability and its effects.

Workers may ask an official from any trade union to accompany them at a
disciplinary or grievance hearing, regardless of whether or not they are a
member or the union is recognised.

Fellow workers or trade union officials do not have to accept a request to
accompany a worker, and they should not be pressurised to do so.

Trade unions should ensure that their officials are trained in the role of acting as
a worker's companion. Even when a trade union official has experience of acting
in the role, there may still be a need for periodic refresher training. Employers
should consider allowing time off for this training.

A worker who has agreed to accompany a colleague employed by the same
employer is entitled to take a reasonable amount of paid time off to fulfil that
responsibility. This should cover the hearing and it is also good practice to allow

46

Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

time for the companion to familiarise themselves with the case and confer with
the worker before and after the hearing.

A lay trade union official is permitted to take a reasonable amount of paid time
off to accompany a worker at a hearing, as long as the worker is employed by
the same employer. In cases where a lay official agrees to accompany a worker
employed by another organisation, time off is a matter for agreement by the
parties concerned.

Applying the right

The employer should allow a companion to have a say in the date and time of a
hearing. If the companion cannot attend on a proposed date, the worker can
suggest an alternative time and date so long as it is reasonable and it is not
more than five working days after the original date.

Employers may, however, wish to allow more time than this for a re-arranged
meeting, particularly where the grievance may be connected with a potential
dismissal. For instance, a grievance raised by a worker who complains that an
ongoing disciplinary process which may result in their dismissal is unfair in some
way. An employer must always act fairly in order to avoid a finding of unfair
dismissal. Where there is a request to postpone a grievance hearing for more
than five working days because a trade union representative or other companion
is not available, it may be fair to allow the postponement if it does not cause
unreasonable delay. The employer should consider the facts and decide what is
fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

Before the hearing takes place, the worker should tell the employer who they
have chosen as a companion. In certain circumstances (for instance when the
companion is an official of a non-recognised trade union) it can be helpful for the
companion and employer to make contact before the hearing.

The companion must be allowed to address the meeting in order to:

e put the worker’s case
* sum up the worker’s case
* respond on the worker’s behalf to any view expressed at the hearing

° confer with the worker during the meeting.

The companion must also be allowed to confer with the worker during the
hearing. It is good practice to allow the companion to participate as fully as
possible in the hearing, including asking witnesses questions. The employer is,
however, not legally required to permit the companion to answer questions on
the worker’s behalf, or to address the hearing if the worker does not wish it, or
to prevent the employer from explaining their case.

Workers whose employers fail to comply with a reasonable request to be
accompanied may present a complaint to an employment tribunal. Workers may
also complain to a tribunal if employers fail to re-arrange a hearing to a

47

Page number: 48
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

reasonable date proposed by the worker when a companion cannot attend on
the date originally proposed.

Employers should be careful not to disadvantage workers for using their right to
be accompanied or for being companions, as this is against the law and could
lead to a claim to an employment tribunal.

Decide on appropriate action

 

Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
Extract

Following the meeting decide on what action, if any, to take. Decisions should be
communicated to the employee, in writing, without unreasonable delay and,
where appropriate, should set out what action the employer intends to take to
resolve the grievance. The employee should be informed that they can appeal if
they are not content with the action taken.

 

It is generally good practice to adjourn a meeting before a decision is taken
about how to deal with an employee’s grievance. This allows time for reflection
and proper consideration. It also allows for any further checking of any matters
raised.

Set out clearly in writing any action that is to be taken and the employee's right
of appeal. Where an employee’s grievance is not upheld make sure the reasons
are carefully explained.

Bear in mind that actions taken to resolve a grievance may have an impact on
other individuals. While confidentiality is of prime importance in handling any
grievance, in some circumstances there may be other individuals who may need
to know the outcome, or certain aspects of the outcome that will impact on
them. For instance, in cases where the grievance was about a fellow employee,
that individual should also be informed of any aspect of the decision that affects
them and the reasons for it. In such cases, the employee who raised the
grievance should be informed of who else will be told about the decision and
what type of information they will be given.

If the grievance highlights any issues concerning policies, procedures or conduct
(even if not sufficiently serious to merit separate disciplinary procedures) they
should be addressed as soon as possible.

Ensure any action taken is monitored and reviewed, as appropriate, so that it
deals effectively with the issues.

Allow the employee to take the grievance further if not resolved

Discipline and grievances at work

Where an employee feels that their grievance has not been satisfactorily
resolved they should appeal. They should let their employer know the grounds
for their appeal without unreasonable delay and in writing.

Appeals should be heard without unreasonable delay and at a time and place
which should be notified to the employee in advance.

The appeal should be dealt with impartially and wherever possible by a manager
who has not previously been involved in the case.

Workers have a statutory right to be accompanied at any such appeal hearing.

The outcome of the appeal should be communicated to the employee in writing
without unreasonable delay.

 

Arranging an appeal

If an employee informs the employer that they are unhappy with the decision
after a grievance meeting, the employer should arrange an appeal. As far as
reasonably practicable the appeal should be dealt with by someone who was not
involved in the original case and ideally with a more senior manager than the
one who dealt with the original grievance.

In small organisations, even if there is no more senior manager available,
another manager should, if possible, hear the appeal. If this is not possible
consider whether the owner or, in the case of a charity, the board of trustees,
should hear the appeal. Whoever hears the appeal should consider it impartially.

At the same time as inviting the employee to attend the appeal, the employer
should remind them of their right to be accompanied at the appeal meeting.

The appeal meeting should be conducted in the same calm, impartial and fair
manner as the initial grievance meeting.

 

As with the first meeting, the employer should write to the employee with a
decision on their grievance as soon as possible. They should also tell the
employee if the appeal meeting is the final stage of the grievance procedure.

Where the grievance is about a fellow employee, that individual should be
informed both that the initial decision has been appealed and the anticipated
timeframe for the appeal decision, and should be provided with support where
necessary. Once a decision on the appeal has been made, that individual should
then be informed of any aspect of the decision that affects them and the reasons
for it.

As with the initial decision, the employee who raised the grievance should be
told if anyone else will be informed about the appeal decision and the type of
information they will be given.

Large organisations may wish to allow a further appeal to a higher level of
management, such as a director. However, in smaller firms the first appeal will
usually mark the end of the grievance procedure. A sample grievance procedure
for small organisations is at Appendix 2.

Dealing with special cases

The foreword to the Code of Practice points out that organisations may wish to
consider dealing with issues involving bullying, harassment or whistleblowing
under a separate procedure.

For further advice about how to deal with bullying and harassment see the Acas
advice leaflet Bullying and harassment at work: a guide for managers and
employers available to download from the Acas website
www.acas.org.uk/bullying.

 

Mediation may be particularly useful in these types of cases.

Appendix |
Disciplinary rules for small organisations
Checklist
As a minimum, rules should:
° be simple, clear and in writing
° be displayed prominently in the workplace
* be known and understood by all employees

* cover issues such as absences, timekeeping, health and safety and use of
organisational facilities and equipment (add any other items relevant to
your organisation)

° indicate examples of the type of conduct which will normally lead to
disciplinary action other than dismissal - for instance lateness or
unauthorised absence

° indicate examples of the type of conduct which will normally lead to
dismissal without notice - examples may include working dangerously,
stealing or fighting - although much will depend on the circumstances of
each offence.

Discipline and grievances at work

Appendix 2

Sample disciplinary and grievance procedures
Sample disciplinary procedure (any organisation)

1. Purpose and scope

This procedure is designed to help and encourage all employees to achieve and
maintain standards of conduct, attendance and job performance. The company
rules (a copy of which is displayed in the office) and this procedure apply to all
employees. The aim is to ensure consistent and fair treatment for all in the
organisation.

2. Principles
Informal action will be considered, where appropriate, to resolve problems.

No disciplinary action will be taken against an employee until the case has been
fully investigated.

For formal action the employee will be advised of the nature of the complaint
against him or her and will be given the opportunity to state his or her case
before any decision is made at a disciplinary meeting.

Employees will be provided, where appropriate, with written copies of evidence
and relevant witness statements in advance of a disciplinary meeting.

At all stages of the procedure the employee will have the right to be
accompanied by a trade union representative, or work colleague.

No employee will be dismissed for a first breach of discipline except in the case
of gross misconduct, when the penalty will be dismissal without notice or
payment in lieu of notice.

An employee will have the right to appeal against any disciplinary action.

The procedure may be implemented at any stage if the employee’s alleged
misconduct warrants this.

3. The Procedure
First stage of formal procedure

This will normally be either:

* an improvement note for unsatisfactory performance if performance
does not meet acceptable standards. This will set out the performance
problem, the improvement that is required, the timescale, any help that
may be given and the right of appeal. The individual will be advised that it
constitutes the first stage of the formal procedure. A record of the
improvement note will be kept for ... months, but will then be considered
spent — subject to achieving and sustaining satisfactory performance

51

305


--- New Page 52 ---
Page number: 52
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

or

° a first warning for misconduct if conduct does not meet acceptable
standards. This will be in writing and set out the nature of the misconduct
and the change in behaviour required and the right of appeal. The warning
will also inform the employee that a final written warning may be
considered if there is no sustained satisfactory improvement or change. A
record of the warning will be kept, but it will be disregarded for
disciplinary purposes after a specified period (eg, six months).

Final written warning

If the offence is sufficiently serious, or if there is further misconduct or a failure
to improve performance during the currency of a prior warning, a final written
warning may be given to the employee. This will give details of the complaint,
the improvement required and the timescale. It will also warn that failure to
improve may lead to dismissal (or some other action short of dismissal) and will
refer to the right of appeal. A copy of this written warning will be kept by the
supervisor but will be disregarded for disciplinary purposes after ... months
subject to achieving and sustaining satisfactory conduct or performance.

Dismissal or other sanction

If there is still further misconduct or failure to improve performance the final
step in the procedure may be dismissal or some other action short of dismissal
such as demotion or disciplinary suspension or transfer (as allowed in the
contract of employment). Dismissal decisions can only be taken by the
appropriate senior manager, and the employee will be provided in writing with
reasons for dismissal, the date on which the employment will terminate, and the
right of appeal.

If some sanction short of dismissal is imposed, the employee will receive details
of the complaint, will be warned that dismissal could result if there is no
satisfactory improvement, and will be advised of the right of appeal. A copy of
the written warning will be kept by the supervisor but will be disregarded for
disciplinary purposes after ... months subject to achievement and sustainment of
satisfactory conduct or performance.

Gross misconduct

The following list provides some examples of offences which are normally
regarded as gross misconduct:

° theft or fraud

° physical violence or bullying

e deliberate and serious damage to property

* serious misuse of an organisation’s property or name

e deliberately accessing internet sites containing pornographic, offensive or
obscene material

Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

° serious insubordination
e unlawful discrimination or harassment

° bringing the organisation into serious disrepute

* serious incapability at work brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs
* causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence

* aserious breach of health and safety rules

* a serious breach of confidence.

If you are accused of an act of gross misconduct, you may be suspended from
work on full pay, normally for no more than five working days, while the alleged
offence is investigated. If, on completion of the investigation and the full
disciplinary procedure, the organisation is satisfied that gross misconduct has
occurred, the result will normally be summary dismissal without notice or
payment in lieu of notice.

Appeals

An employee who wishes to appeal against a disciplinary decision must do so
within five working days. The senior manager will hear all appeals and his/her
decision is final. At the appeal any disciplinary penalty imposed will be reviewed.

Discipline and grievances at work

Sample disciplinary procedure (small organisation)
1. Purpose and scope

The organisation's aim is to encourage improvement in individual conduct or
performance. This procedure sets out the action which will be taken when
disciplinary rules are breached.

2. Principles

a) The procedure is designed to establish the facts quickly and to deal
consistently with disciplinary issues. No disciplinary action will be taken until
the matter has been fully investigated.

b) At every stage employees will be informed in writing of what is alleged and
have the opportunity to state their case at a disciplinary meeting and be
represented or accompanied, if they wish, by a trade union representative or
a work colleague.

c) An employee has the right to appeal against any disciplinary penalty.

3. The Procedure

Stage 1 - first warning

If conduct or performance is unsatisfactory, the employee will be given a written
warning or performance note. Such warnings will be recorded, but disregarded
after ... months of satisfactory service. The employee will also be informed that
a final written warning may be considered if there is no sustained satisfactory
improvement or change. (Where the first offence is sufficiently serious, for
example because it is having, or is likely to have, a serious harmful effect on the
organisation, it may be justifiable to move directly to a final written warning.)

Stage 2 -— final written warning

If the offence is serious, or there is no improvement in standards, or if a further
offence of a similar kind occurs, a final written warning will be given which will
include the reason for the warning and a note that if no improvement results
within ... months, action at Stage 3 will be taken.

Stage 3 - dismissal or action short of dismissal

If the conduct or performance has failed to improve, the employee may suffer
demotion, disciplinary transfer, loss of seniority (as allowed in the contract) or
dismissal.

Gross misconduct

If, after investigation, it is confirmed that an employee has committed an
offence of the following nature (the list is not exhaustive), the normal

consequence will be dismissal without notice or payment in lieu of notice: °
theft, damage to property, fraud, incapacity for work due to being under the

54

Discipline and grievances at work

influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, physical violence, bullying and gross
insubordination.

While the alleged gross misconduct is being investigated, the employee may be
suspended, during which time he or she will be paid their normal pay rate. Any
decision to dismiss will be taken by the employer only after full investigation.
Appeals

An employee who wishes to appeal against any disciplinary decision must do so
to the named person in the organisation within five working days. The employer
will hear the appeal and decide the case impartially.

Discipline and grievances at work

Sample grievance procedure (small organisation)

Dealing with grievances informally

If you have a grievance or complaint to do with your work or the people you
work with you should, wherever possible, start by talking it over with your
manager. You may be able to agree a solution informally between you.

Formal grievance

If the matter is serious and/or you wish to raise the matter formally you should
set out the grievance in writing to your manager. You should stick to the facts
and avoid language that is insulting or abusive.

Where your grievance is against your manager and you feel unable to approach
him or her you should talk to another manager or the owner.

Grievance hearing

Your manager will call you to a meeting, normally within five working days, to
discuss your grievance. You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or
trade union representative at this meeting if you make a reasonable request.

After the meeting the manager will give you a decision in writing, normally
within 24 hours.

If it is necessary to gather further information before making a decision your
manger will inform you of this and the likely timescale involved.

Appeal

If you are unhappy with your manager’s decision and you wish to appeal you
should let your manager know.

You will be invited to an appeal meeting, normally within five working days, and
your appeal will be heard by a more senior manager (or the company owner).
You have the right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union
representative at this meeting if you make a reasonable request.

After the meeting the manager (or owner) will give you a decision, normally
within 24 hours. The manager’s (or owner’s) decision is final.

about unauthorised short-term and long-term absences, and the failure to return
from extended leave. More extensive advice on attendance management is
available in the Acas advisory booklet, Managing attendance and employee
turnover available to download on the Acas website https://www.acas.org.uk.

 

A distinction should be made between absence on grounds of illness or injury
and absence for no good reason which may call for disciplinary action. Where
disciplinary action is called for, the normal disciplinary procedure should be used.
Where the employee is absent because of illness or injury, the guidance in this
Appendix should be followed.

Discipline and grievances at work

Employers should be aware of the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 when
making any decisions that affect someone who may be disabled as defined by
the Act. (For further information see the Equality and Human Rights Commission
website at https://www.equalityhumanrights.com.)

 

Records showing lateness and the duration of and reasons for all spells of
absence should be kept to help monitor absence levels. These enable
management to check levels of absence or lateness so that problems can be
spotted and addressed at an early stage. (The Information Commissioner has
produced a Code of Practice on employment records, available at
https://www.ico.org.uk).

 

How should frequent and persistent short-term absence be handled?

* unexpected absences should be investigated promptly and the employee
asked for an explanation at a return-to-work interview

e if there are no acceptable reasons then the employer may wish to treat the
matter as a conduct issue and deal with it under the disciplinary procedure

e where there is no medical certificate to support frequent short-term,
selfcertified, absences then the employee should be asked to see a doctor to
establish whether treatment is necessary and whether the underlying reason
for the absence is work-related. If no medical support is forthcoming the
employer should consider whether to take action under the disciplinary
procedure

if the absence could be disability related the employer should consider what
reasonable adjustments could be made in the workplace to help the
employee (this might be something as simple as an adequate, ergonomic
chair, or a power-assisted piece of equipment). Reasonable adjustment also
means redeployment to a different type of work if necessary. (For further
information see the Equality and Human Rights Commission website at
www.equalityhumanrights.com. )

 

e if the absence is because of temporary problems relating to dependants, the
employee may be entitled to have time off under the provisions of the
Employment Rights Act 1996 relating to time off for dependants

e if the absence is because the employee has difficulty managing both work
and home responsibilities then the employer should give serious
consideration to more flexible ways of working. Employees have the right to
request flexible working arrangements — including job-sharing, part-time
working, flexi-time, working from home/teleworking and school time
contracts - and employers must have a good business reason for rejecting
any application

Discipline and grievances at work

e in all cases the employee should be told what improvement in attendance is
expected and warned of the likely consequences if this does not happen

° if there is no improvement, the employee's length of service, performance,
the likelihood of a change in attendance, the availability of suitable
alternative work where appropriate, and the effect of past and future
absences on the organisation should all be taken into account in deciding
appropriate action.

In order to show both the employee concerned, and other employees, that
absence is regarded as a serious matter and may result in dismissal, it is very
important that persistent absence is dealt with promptly, firmly and consistently.

An examination of records will identify those employees who are frequently
absent and may show an absence pattern.

How should longer-term absence through ill health be handled?

Where absence is due to medically certificated illness, the issue becomes one of
capability rather than conduct. Employers need to take a more sympathetic and
considerate approach, particularly if the employee is disabled and where
reasonable adjustments at the workplace might enable them to return to work.

There are certain steps an employer should take when considering the problem
of long-term absence:

* employee and employer should keep in regular contact with each other
e the employee must be kept fully informed if there is any risk to employment

° if the employer wishes to contact the employee’s doctor, he or she must
notify the employee in writing that they intend to make such an application
and they must secure the employee’s consent in writing (Access to Medical
Reports Act 1988). The employer must inform the individual that he or she
has:

— the right to withhold consent to the application being made

— the right to state that he or she wishes to have access to the report.
(The Access to Medical Reports Act 1988 gives the individual the right
to have access to the medical practitioner’s report for up to six months
after it was supplied)

— rights concerning access to the report before (and/or after) it is
supplied

— the right to withhold consent to the report being supplied to the
employer

--- New Page 67 ---
Page number: 67
Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

— the right to request amendments to the report

° where the employee states that he or she wishes to have access to the
report, the employer must let the GP know this when making the application
and at the same time let the employee know that the report has been
requested

e the letter of enquiry reproduced in Appendix 3 —- Sample letters, and
approved by the British Medical Association, may be used, and the
employee’s permission to the enquiry should be attached to the letter

 

e the GP should return the report via the company doctor. If there is not one
the employer should make it clear to the employee, when seeking permission
to approach the GP, that the report will be sent direct to the employer.
(Employers who wish to seek advice on securing the services of a company
doctor should contact the Faculty of Occupational Medicine
https://www.fom.ac.uk/)

 

e the employee must contact the GP within 21 days of the date of application
to make arrangement to see the report. Otherwise the rights under the 1988
Act will be lost

° if the employee considers the report to be incorrect or misleading, the
employee may make a written request to the GP to make appropriate
amendments

° if the GP refuses, the employee has the right to ask the GP to attach a
statement to the report reflecting the employee’s view on any matters of
disagreement

° the employee may withhold consent to the report being supplied to the
employer

* on the basis of the GP’s report the employer should consider whether
alternative work is available

° the employer is not expected to create a special job for the employee
concerned, nor to be a medical expert, but to take action on the basis of the
medical evidence

° where there is a reasonable doubt about the nature of the illness or injury,
the employee should be asked if he or she would agree to be examined by a
doctor to be appointed by the organisation

Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

e where an employee refuses to cooperate in providing medical evidence, or to
undergo an independent medical examination, the employee should be told in
writing that a decision will be taken on the basis of the information available
and that it could result in dismissal

° where the employee is allergic to a product used in the workplace the
employer should consider remedial action or a transfer to alternative work

e where the employee’s job can no longer be held open, and no suitable
alternative work is available, the employee should be informed of the
likelihood of dismissal

e where dismissal action is taken the employee should be given the period of
notice to which he or she is entitled by statute or contract and informed of
any right of appeal.

Where an employee has been on long-term sickness absence and there is little
likelihood of them becoming fit enough to return, it may be argued that the
contract of employment has been terminated through ‘frustration’. However, the
doctrine of frustration should not be relied on since the courts are generally
reluctant to apply it where a procedure exists for termination of the contract. It
is therefore better for the employer to take dismissal action after following
proper procedures.

 

Specific health problems

Consideration should be given to introducing measures to help employees,
regardless of status or seniority, who are suffering from alcohol or drug abuse,
or from stress. The aim should be to identify employees affected and encourage
them to seek help and treatment. See the Acas advisory booklet Hea/th, work
and wellbeing available to download on the Acas website
https://www.acas.org.uk Employers should consider whether it is appropriate to
treat the problem as a medical rather than a disciplinary matter.

 

There is sometimes workforce pressure to dismiss an employee because of a
medical condition, or even threats of industrial action. If such an employee is
dismissed, then he or she may be able to claim unfair dismissal before an
employment tribunal, or breach of contract. Employers should bear in mind that
they may have to justify the reasonableness of any decision to dismiss and that
an employment tribunal will ignore threats of, and actual, industrial action when
determining the fairness of a decision (Section 107, Employment Rights Act
1996).

The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful for an employer of any size to treat a
disabled person less favourably for a reason relating to their disability, without a
justifiable reason. Employers are required to make a reasonable adjustment to
working conditions or the workplace where that would help to accommodate a
particular disabled person.

Failure to return from extended leave on the agreed date

Employers may have policies which allow employees extended leave of absence
without pay, for example to visit relatives in their countries of origin, or relatives
who have emigrated to other countries, or to nurse a sick relative. There is no
general statutory right to such leave without pay, except to deal with an initial
emergency relating to a dependant under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Where a policy of extended leave is in operation, the following points should be
borne in mind:

e the policy should apply to all employees, irrespective of their age, disability,
gender reassignment, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy and
maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation

* any conditions attaching to the granting of extended leave should be carefully
explained to the employee, using interpreters if necessary, and the
employee’s signature should be obtained as an acknowledgement that he or
she understands and accepts them.

* employers should be aware that agreed extended leave can preserve
continuity of employment, even when such leave is unpaid and other terms
and conditions of employment are suspended for the duration of the leave

° if an employee fails to return on the agreed date, this should be approached
in the same way as any other failure to abide by the rules and the
circumstances should be investigated in the normal way, with disciplinary
procedures being followed if appropriate

* care should be taken to ensure that foreign medical certificates are not
treated in a discriminatory way: employees can fall ill while abroad just as
they can fall ill in this country

° before deciding to dismiss an employee who overstays leave, the employee’s
experience, length of service, reliability record and any explanation given
should all be taken into account

e failure to return from ordinary maternity leave does not of itself terminate
the contract of employment. Employers should try and find out the reason for
the failure and take action if necessary as in any other case of failing to
return from leave (whether extended/additional
maternity/paternity/adoption/parental leave; time off for dependants; or
holiday leave).

An agreement that an employee should return to work on a particular date will
not prevent a complaint of unfair dismissal to an employment tribunal if the
employee is dismissed for failing to return as agreed. In all such cases, all the
factors mentioned above and the need to act reasonably should be borne in
mind before any dismissal action is taken.

Appendix 5

Basic principles of the Data Protection Act 2018 and The Equality
Act 2010

The Data Protection Act 2018

The Data Protection Act provides a framework that controls how personal
information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.

The Act works in two ways. Firstly, it states that anyone who processes personal
information must comply with six principles, which make sure that the
information is:

° used fairly, lawfully and transparently
e used for specified, explicit purposes

°e used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is
necessary

* accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
° kept for no longer than is necessary

° handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection
against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction or
damage

There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:

° race

° ethnic background

° political opinions

° religious beliefs

* trade union membership

° genetics

* biometrics (where used for identification)
° health

e sex life or orientation

There are separate safeguards for personal data relating to criminal convictions
and offences.

Title of ebook of origin: 30.acas_discipline_and_grievance_at_work.pdf

Discipline and grievances at work

The second area covered by the Act provides individuals with important rights.
These include the right to:

° be informed about how your data is being used
* access personal data

e have incorrect data updated

° have data erased

e stop or restrict the processing of your data

° data portability (allowing you to get and reuse your data for different
services)

* object to how your data is processed in certain circumstances.

Should an individual or organisation feel they’re being denied access to personal
information they’re entitled to, or feel their information has not been handled
according to the six principles, they can contact the Information Commissioner’s
Office (ICO) for help on O303 123 1113. Complaints are usually dealt with
informally, but if this isn’t possible, enforcement action can be taken.

The ICO provides comprehensive practical advice on how to comply with data
protection law at_www.ico.org.uk. In particular, the Employment Practices Data
Protection Code deals with the impact of data protection laws on the
employment relationship. It covers such issues as:

* recruitment and selection (job applications and pre-employment
vetting)

* employment records (collecting, storing, disclosing and deleting records

* monitoring at work (monitoring workers’ use of telephones, the
internet, e-mail systems and vehicles)

° workers’ health (occupational health, medical testing, drug and genetic
screening).

The Equality Act 2010

The Equality Act gives disabled people some particular employment rights. A
disabled person is defined in the Act as ‘anyone with a physical or mental
impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect upon his or her
ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities’.

However, disability does not necessarily affect someone’s health, so insisting on
a medical report purely on the basis of the disability may be unlawful
discrimination. If your organisation believes that pre- employment health
screening is necessary, you must make Sure it is carried out ina

71

325

Discipline and grievances at work

nondiscriminatory way. It is unlawful to ask health related questions before
making a job offer (whether conditional or unconditional), except in order to:

e determine if a candidate can carry out a function which is essential to the
job

* ask whether candidates need special arrangements for any part of the
application process

* anonymously monitor whether candidates are disabled
° take positive action to assist disabled people

e check that a candidate has a disability where this is a genuine
requirement of the job.

If a report from any individual’s doctor is sought, then permission must be given
by the individual, and they have the right to see the report (Access to Medical
Reports Act 1988).

Discrimination means treating someone less favourably without a reasonable
justification, and the Act requires that employers make reasonable adjustments
if that will then remove the reason for the unfavourable treatment. An example
of a reasonable adjustment could be the provision of a suitable computer
keyboard to an operator who had difficulty through disability in using a
conventional keyboard.

In relation to discipline and grievance procedures, employers must clearly ensure
they do not discriminate in any area of practice which could lead to dismissal or
any other detriment (for example warnings).

The Act also covers people who become disabled during the course of their
employment, and this is particularly relevant to the absence handling section of
this handbook. It is vital that the employer should discuss with the worker what
their needs really are and what effect, if any, the disability may have on future
work with the organisation. Any dismissal of a disabled employee for a reason
relating to the disability would have to be justified, and the reason for it would
have to be one which could not be removed or made less than substantial by
any reasonable adjustment.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission provides information and advice
about all aspects of the Equality Act 2010, as well as signposting specialist
organisations where necessary. In addition, it can offer good practice advice on
the employment of disabled people.

first written warning for misconduct or dismissing someone for gross misconduct

Disciplinary procedure: a procedure for organisations to follow to deal with
cases of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. It helps employers deal with
discipline cases fairly and consistently

Employees: people who work for an employer under a contract of employment
and who are entitled to all statutory employment rights. See also the glossary
entry for “Workers” below

Grievance: a problem or concern that an employee has about their work,
working conditions or relationships with colleagues or managers

Grievance procedure: a procedure for organisations to use to consider
employees’ grievances. It helps employers deal with grievances fairly and
consistently

Gross misconduct: acts which are so serious as to justify possible dismissal.
See example list in Taking action after the disciplinary meeting

 

Improvement note: in cases of unsatisfactory performance an employee
should be given an improvement note setting out the performance problem, the
improvement that is required, the timescale for achieving this improvement, a

Dismissals

1. What dismissal is

A dismissal is when an employer ends an employee's contract. It usually means the same as being sacked or fired.
It's important that an employer uses a fair and reasonable procedure to decide whether to dismiss someone.
Before an employer dismisses an employee, they should:

e believe they have a valid reason — read about types of dismissal and reasons to dismiss someone fairly
e follow a full and fair procedure, usually in line with the Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures
e make a decision that's balanced, consistent and as fair as possible

 

 

The procedure an employer follows will be taken into account if an employee claims for unfair dismissal and the case reaches an
employment tribunal.

Giving the reasons for dismissal

If an employer dismisses an employee, they should tell the employee:

e why they've been dismissed

e when their employment contract will end
e their notice period, if there is one

e their right to appeal the decision

It's a good idea to put it in writing.
When an employer must put the reasons in writing

An employer must put the reasons in writing for an employee who's pregnant or on maternity leave, regardless of how long they've
been employed.

Other employees have the right to ask their employer for a written statement giving the reasons for their dismissal if they have:

e 'employee' employment status
e been employed for 2 years

 

If an employee asks, their employer must give them the reasons in writing within 14 days.

If an employee believes the dismissal is unfair

An employee can appeal against a dismissal.

Page 1

331


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 31.acas_guide_for_dismissals.pdf

If the employer does not follow a fair and reasonable procedure the employee might be able to make a claim for unfair dismissal, even
if the reason for dismissal was valid.

Find out what employees can do if they think a dismissal is unfair

 

Telling other people at work

Employers should respect the confidentiality of the person who's been dismissed. For example, when they tell colleagues and clients
that the employee has left. Any outcome of a disciplinary procedure must remain confidential.

Find out more about talking to staff after a disciplinary procedure

 

Settlement agreements

A settlement agreement is sometimes used when an employer and employee agree to end their employment relationship because they
both agree it's no longer working. This can include some dismissal situations.

Find out more about settlement agreements

 

If you're thinking about using a settlement agreement, you should get legal advice.

2. Types of dismissal

By law (Employment Rights Act 1996), the following are potential reasons to dismiss someone fairly:

e conduct — when the employee has done something that's inappropriate or not acceptable

e capability — when the employee is not able to do the job or does not have the right qualifications

e redundancy — when the job is no longer needed

e alegal reason — when the employee cannot do their job legally, for example a lorry driver who's banned from driving
e 'some other substantial reason’ — a term used for a wide variety of other situations

Examples of other substantial reasons are:

e a fixed-term contract ending
e third party pressure, for example if a client refuses to work with an employee
e an employee refusing to agree to new terms and conditions of employment

Gross misconduct

Gross misconduct is when an employee has done something that's very serious or has very serious effects.
Examples could include:

e fraud

e physical violence

e serious lack of care to their duties or other people (‘gross negligence’)

e serious insubordination, for example refusing to take lawful and reasonable orders from a supervisor

Your organisation might have its own policy or rules with other examples of gross misconduct.

Page 2

332


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 31.acas_guide_for_dismissals.pdf

Gross misconduct will usually only be relevant in dismissals related to conduct — in other words, an employee's behaviour at work.

An employer must still follow a fair and reasonable procedure if someone is accused of gross misconduct.

Redundancy

Redundancy is usually a type of dismissal when a role is no longer needed. Employers should only consider making redundancies if
part or all of the organisation is:

e closing, or has already closed
e changing the types or number of roles needed to do certain work
e changing location

In this case, the employer must follow a full redundancy process.

If an employer has concerns about an employee's conduct or performance, they need to follow a disciplinary or capability procedure.

 

Find out more about:

e checking whether redundancies are needed — for employers
e redundancy rights for employees

 

 

Dismissal because of long-term illness

Dismissal should be a last resort. The employer should firstly support the employee and help them get back to work. This could include
making any 'reasonable adjustments' if they have a disability (this includes some long-term health conditions).

For example, an employer may be able to dismiss someone fairly if:

e they've considered all other options
e it's not possible for the employee to do their job
e the employee's inability to work has a significant impact on the business

Dismissal because of long-term illness would usually be a capability issue. This means it would depend on whether or not the
employee is able to do their job.

Employers must investigate fully and have a valid reason for dismissal. The employee could make a claim to an employment tribunal if
they think they've been unfairly dismissed.

Dismissing someone because they're disabled (this includes some long-term health conditions) could be discrimination.

Find out more about disability discrimination

 

3. Dismissals with and without notice

When an employer dismisses an employee, they should give them notice of when their job will end.

Find out more about notice periods

 

Notice pay

--- New Page 4 ---
Page number: 4
Title of ebook of origin: 31.acas_guide_for_dismissals.pdf

In most cases, the person who's been dismissed is entitled to the same pay they'd normally get if they work their notice period.
The employee's final pay may be different from their usual monthly or weekly pay because of things like:

e how much holiday they've taken
e money being deducted for training courses
e being off work

They may need to get paid other outstanding money, for example bonuses or pay for working overtime.

Find out more about final pay when someone leaves a job

 

Dismissal without notice for gross misconduct

An employer can dismiss an employee without giving notice if it's because of gross misconduct (when an employee has done
something that's very serious or has very serious effects). The employer must have followed a fair procedure.

When an employee is dismissed for gross misconduct, they:

e leave immediately
e do not have a notice period
e do not get paid notice pay

There are some things the employer must still pay them for. These include:

e any work they have not been paid for yet
e any holiday they have built up (‘accrued’) but not used by the date they leave
e any expenses they're owed

The employer may also need to pay them for other work benefits, unless their contract says something different.

4. Unfair dismissal

It's important to understand what unfair dismissal is by law. This is because different rights might apply depending on the
circumstances.

It might be unfair dismissal if an employee worked for their employer for at least 2 years and any of the following apply:

e there was no fair reason for the dismissal
e the reason was not enough to justify dismissing them
e the employer did not follow a fair procedure

The fair procedure must follow the Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures, if it's to do with:

 

e unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour (‘misconduct’)
e performance (‘capability’), unless it’s about illness

If the dismissal is because of another reason, it's a good idea to use the Code of Practice to inform the fair procedure.

Dismissal before someone has worked 2 years

If someone is dismissed before they have worked for their employer for 2 years, they will need to check what rights are available to
them. This is sometimes known as ‘short service dismissal’.

Depending on the reason for the dismissal, one of the following might apply:

e automatically unfair dismissal
e wrongful dismissal

Appealing a dismissal

If an employee thinks their dismissal was unfair and wants to challenge it, they can appeal through their employer's appeal process.
The employer should tell them how to appeal.

Being able to appeal a dismissal is also part of the Acas Code of Practice.
The employee may want to speak to their trade union if they have one or get legal advice.

Find out more about appealing a dismissal

 

Automatically unfair reasons

Some things are 'automatically unfair’ if they're the main reason for dismissing an employee.
These include:

e making a flexible working request
e being pregnant or on maternity leave
e wanting to take family leave, for example parental, paternity or adoption leave

 

e being a trade union member or representative

e taking part in legal, official industrial action for 12 weeks or less, for example going on strike
e asking for a legal right, for example to be paid the National Minimum Wage

e doing jury service

e being involved in whistleblowing

e being forced to retire (known as ‘compulsory retirement’)

e taking action, or proposing to take action, over a health and safety issue

An employee does not need 2 years' service to claim automatically unfair dismissal.

Unfair dismissal because of a health and safety issue

An employer must not cause someone ‘detriment’ if they:

e reasonably believe being at work or doing certain tasks would put them in serious and imminent danger
e take reasonable steps over a health and safety issue, for example complaining about unsafe working conditions
e inform their employer about a health and safety issue in an appropriate way

Detriment means you experience one or both of the following:

e being treated worse than before
e having their situation made worse

Examples of detriment could be:

Page 5

335


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 31.acas_guide_for_dismissals.pdf

e their employer reduces their hours

e they experience bullying

e they experience harassment

e their employer turns down their training requests without good reason
e they are overlooked for promotions or development opportunities

If an employee is dismissed and one of these health and safety issues is the main reason, it might be classed as ‘automatically unfair’.

Unfair dismissal because of industrial action

Employees cannot be dismissed for taking part in industrial action if:

e it's called as a result of a properly organised ballot

e it's about a dispute between them and their employer (for example, about terms and conditions)

e the employer receives a legally required, detailed notice about the industrial action at least 7 days before it begins
e they take part in the action at any time within the 12 weeks from when it began

Non-union members have the same rights as union members not to be dismissed if they take part in legal, official industrial action.

After 12 weeks, employees could be dismissed for taking part in industrial action if the employer has tried to settle the dispute. For
example, the employer may have asked Acas to help find a solution.

Constructive dismissal

If an employee feels they have no choice but to resign because of something very serious their employer has done, they might be able
to claim for ‘constructive dismissal’.

The legal term is 'constructive unfair dismissal’.

Find out more about constructive dismissal

 

Making a claim to an employment tribunal

If the employee has tried to appeal and wants to take it further, they may want to make a claim to an employment tribunal.
An employee usually has the right to make an unfair dismissal claim to an employment tribunal if:

e they have 'employee' employment status
e they've worked for their employer for 2 years

 

If they've been dismissed for an ‘automatically unfair’ reason it does not matter how long they've worked for their employer.
If someone thinks they've been discriminated against

If someone thinks they've been unfairly dismissed because of race, sex or another ‘protected characteristic’, this could be
discrimination. They could make a claim to an employment tribunal for both discrimination and unfair dismissal.

For the discrimination claim, they do not need to have worked for their employer for 2 years.

Find out more about discrimination and the law

When to make a claim

There are strict time limits for making a claim to an employment tribunal. Someone has 3 months minus 1 day from the date their
employment ended.

In almost all cases, the date someone's employment ends is either:

e the last day of their notice period
e the day they were dismissed if the employer did not give notice

Find out more about:

e making a claim to an employment tribunal

 

e employment tribunal time limits

 

Wrongful dismissal

A ‘wrongful dismissal’ is when an employer has breached an employee's contract. It's usually to do with notice or notice pay.
Examples of wrongful dismissal can include:

e dismissing an employee without giving them a notice period or notice pay
e not giving someone the full notice period they're entitled to

If an employee wants to make a claim for wrongful dismissal, it does not matter how long they've worked for their employer.

Contact the Acas helpline

If you have any questions about unfair dismissal, you can contact the Acas helpline.

5. Constructive dismissal

If an employee feels they have no choice but to resign because of something their employer has done, they might be able to claim for
‘constructive dismissal’.

The legal term is 'constructive unfair dismissal’.

What constructive dismissal is

An employee can make a constructive dismissal claim if they resign because they think their employer has seriously breached their
employment contract.

Examples could include:

e regularly not being paid the agreed amount without a good reason
e being bullied or discriminated against
e raising a grievance that the employer refuses to look into

Page 7

337


--- New Page 8 ---
Page number: 8
Title of ebook of origin: 31.acas_guide_for_dismissals.pdf

e making unreasonable changes to working patterns or place of work without agreement

It could be because of one serious incident or a series of things.

If you're in this situation

Resigning is a big step to take, and a constructive dismissal claim can be difficult to win at an employment tribunal.
You can raise a problem informally by talking to your employer.

If you've already tried to resolve things informally you can raise a grievance. This is where you make a formal complaint to your
employer.

If you're going to resign, you should get legal advice first.

Settlement agreements

A settlement agreement is sometimes used to end an employment relationship in a way the employer and employee both agree with.
If you sign a settlement agreement, you cannot make a constructive dismissal claim to an employment tribunal.

Find out more about settlement agreements

 

If you resign

In your resignation letter you should explain clearly your reasons for leaving.
If there's been a serious breach of contract you may want to leave your job straight away instead of working your notice period.

Doing this could be a breach of your employment contract but it can be justified sometimes. You should get legal advice.

Making a constructive dismissal claim

You usually have the right to make a constructive dismissal claim to an employment tribunal if:

e you have 'employee' employment status
e you've worked for your employer for 2 years

 

There are strict time limits for making a claim to an employment tribunal. In most cases, you have 3 months minus 1 day from either:

e the last day of your notice period
e the day you resigned, if you did not give your employer notice

Investigations at work

1. Step 1: Deciding to investigate

When there is a possible work disciplinary or grievance issue, the employer should do an ‘investigation’. This is where they find out all
they reasonably can about the issue.

An investigation is to:

e see if there is a case to answer

e make sure everyone is treated fairly

e gather evidence from all sides

e help the employer to see what should happen next

At any stage the employer can still look at whether:

e the formal procedure needs to carry on
e the issue can be resolved informally instead

Following a fair procedure

To protect everyone involved in a disciplinary or grievance case, the employer must make sure they follow a fair procedure. The
investigation is an important part of this.

If the employer does not carry out a reasonable investigation, any decisions they make in the disciplinary or grievance case are likely
to be unfair. This could risk legal action.

Investigations are covered by the Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures, which is the minimum an
organisation must follow. Your organisation might have its own policy or procedure.

 

If a disciplinary or grievance case reaches an employment tribunal, judges will look at whether the employer has followed the Acas
Code of Practice in a fair way.

Training for employers and managers

You can get Acas training on conducting investigations and following a fair disciplinary or grievance procedure.

 

2. Step 2: Preparing to investigate

If the employer has decided to investigate a disciplinary or grievance issue, they should start as soon as possible.

Page 1

339


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

This is to make sure they're treating the employee fairly. For example, people might remember a situation more clearly the sooner
they're asked about it.

Who can carry out the investigation

Where possible, the employer should get somebody who's not involved in the case to carry out the investigation, for example another
manager or someone from HR.

This is to keep things as fair as possible. In smaller organisations, the employer might have to do it themselves.

Where possible, the person investigating should also have had training. Acas offers training courses in handling disciplinary and
grievance procedures, including courses on conducting investigations.

In a disciplinary case
In a disciplinary case, the employer should think about who will handle matters if further action is needed.

Where possible, a different person should handle each step of the disciplinary procedure that's needed:

e the investigation
e the disciplinary hearing and outcome
e the appeal hearing (if an appeal is raised)

 

Where possible, the employer should assign a more senior person to handle the disciplinary hearing and outcome than the person
assigned to the investigation.

In a grievance case

For a grievance investigation, it is usually best for the person hearing the grievance to investigate the issue.

You can find more details on choosing who to carry out the investigation in the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations.

 

Making an investigation plan

The employer and the person investigating, if there is one, should start by making an investigation plan.
This can include:

e what needs to be investigated

e who is carrying out the investigation

e 'witnesses' — anyone who needs to be spoken with to find out about the issue

e any sources of evidence, for example work records, emails or CCTV recordings

e any time limits, for example CCTV footage being deleted or staff going on leave

e timeframes

e policies or organisation guidelines to follow

e whether the person investigating is expected to give recommendations at the end of the investigation
e setting out the importance of confidentiality

e any other relevant points or information

A clear plan can help to:

Page 2

348


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

e make the investigation as quick and easy as possible
e make clear exactly what needs to be done

e make sure the process is full and fair

e avoid negative effects on staff or the business

Employers and investigators can:

e find more details on making an investigation plan in the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations
e download and use the Acas template for an investigation plan

 

 

Telling the employee

The employer or person investigating should tell the employee with the disciplinary or grievance issue as soon as they decide to open
an investigation.

This is unless the employer thinks there is a risk that the employee might tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. In this case, the
employer should wait until there is less risk of this.

When the employer tells the employee they are opening an investigation, it’s a good idea for them to explain:

e why they're carrying out an investigation

e who will be carrying it out

e what they're going to do

e that they'll need to talk to any witnesses

e how long it could take

e what will happen next, for example a meeting
e that everything will be kept confidential

Employers can use the Acas letter templates for:

e disciplinary cases — informing an employee they are the subject of an investigation
e grievance or disciplinary cases — inviting an employee to an investigation meeting

An investigation can be stressful for the employee in either disciplinary or grievance cases. It's important for employers to consider the
wellbeing and mental health of their employees and offer support where needed.

Deciding whether to suspend an employee

If there's a serious issue or situation, an employer might consider suspending someone while they investigate.
An employer should consider each situation carefully. Suspension will only be needed in some situations.
If an employer feels they need to suspend someone, it's important to consider:

e alternative options to suspension
e the wellbeing of the person they're thinking of suspending — being suspended can be stressful and affect someone's mental
health

Find out more about suspension during an investigation

Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

3. Step 3: Carrying out an investigation

In a disciplinary or grievance investigation, the person investigating should do their best to:

e be fair and objective

e follow any policies or guidelines your organisation might have

e get as much information on the case as is reasonable

e not try to prove guilt, but get balanced evidence from both sides
e keep the case confidential

In a disciplinary procedure, the person investigating should be finding out if there is an issue that needs to be addressed, not trying to
prove guilt.

How long an investigation needs to take

While an investigation should be completed as quickly as possible, it always needs to be thorough and fair.
Some investigations might take longer depending on the case and how many people need to give information.

For example, a simple case might only take a day to gather enough information, whereas a more complicated case could take several
weeks.

Your organisation might have timescales for investigations written in their policy. Otherwise, the employer or person investigating
should set a reasonable timescale and tell the employee.

If it's found that more time is needed during the investigation, this should be allowed for. Any delays should be explained to anyone
involved and written in the investigation report.

Getting physical evidence

The person investigating should get all the information they reasonably can and need for the case.
They should work out what physical evidence is needed based on:

e what's laid out in the investigation plan
e what sources of information they can use
e any time limits, for example records getting deleted

More evidence might come to light as the investigation goes on, so the person investigating should allow for this.
Types of physical evidence could include:

e emails

e paperwork

e receipts

e computer records
e phone records

e CCTV recordings
e attendance records

Page 4

342


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

The person investigating must consider the ways they can get information and:

e follow the law — for example, on data protection or employment contracts
e respect the employee's right to privacy

You can find out more on:

e data protection on the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) website

 

e gathering evidence in the right way in the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations

 

The person investigating should keep a written record of how and why they got any evidence.

Holding investigation meetings

In both disciplinary and grievance investigations, the person investigating might also need to get information from:

e the employee
e 'witnesses' — other employees involved
e other witnesses, for example clients or customers

If you need to invite someone to an investigation meeting, you should:

e let them know in writing — for example, a letter or email
e confirm the date, time and location
e give them reasonable notice

The right to be accompanied

"The right to be accompanied’ means that by law, an employee or worker can bring a ‘companion’ (relevant person):

e to any meetings — in a grievance procedure
e to a meeting or hearing that will give or confirm a formal warning or other disciplinary action — in a disciplinary procedure

In a disciplinary investigation meeting, there is no legal right to be accompanied but it's good practice for employers to allow it.
If there's the right to be accompanied

If the employee or worker has the right to be accompanied, they must choose their companion from one of the following:

e someone they work with
e a workplace trade union representative who's certified or trained in acting as a companion
e an official employed by a trade union

Under discrimination law, employers must make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees. This might mean allowing someone
else to attend, for example a support worker or someone with knowledge of the disability and its effects.

Employers can, but do not have to, allow companions who do not fall within the above categories. For example, some employment
contracts might allow for a professional support body, partner or legal representative.

Find out more about the right to be accompanied in the Acas guide to discipline and grievances at work.

 

If an employee cannot attend an investigation meeting

Page 5

343


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

If an employee needs to go to an investigation meeting but they do not attend, the person investigating should rearrange the meeting.
The employer or person investigating should see if it would help to make other arrangements.

For example, if the employee is off with stress and is worried about coming to the workplace, they could hold the meeting somewhere
else.

If the employee is too sick, or continues to be not able or not willing to attend, the person investigating will need to look at all other
evidence and make a reasonable decision.

They could also look at:

e the seriousness of the disciplinary or grievance issue

e any rules your organisation has about not attending investigation meetings

e how your organisation dealt with similar cases in the past

e getting a medical opinion on whether the employee is fit to attend the meeting — with the employee's permission

The employer might decide they need to carry on with the investigation without the employee. If they do, they should tell the employee.

The employer must carry out the investigation in as full and fair a way as possible.

Looking after employees’ wellbeing and mental health

Being under investigation can be very stressful, so it's important that employers consider the wellbeing and mental health of their
employees.

Looking out for employees' wellbeing and offering support can help prevent:

e absence
e mental health problems arising
e existing mental health problems getting worse

For example, as well as regular communication, the employer could arrange any meetings in a more private and comfortable location if
this would help an employee.

4. Step 4: If there are witnesses
Witnesses can give important evidence that might help decide the outcome of a disciplinary or grievance case.

If there's any witnesses with information about the discipline or grievance issue, the person investigating can ask them to write it down
in a witness statement’.

The person investigating can also have a meeting with a witness to ask them what they know or saw. Someone should take notes
during the meeting. At the end of the meeting, the witness should sign the notes and these can also form a witness statement.

Page 6

344


--- New Page 7 ---
Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

Taking a witness statement

The person investigating might decide a witness can give a statement without having a meeting. For example, if the witness:

e is not an employee, for example a customer or client
e only needs to give very simple information
e is ill and cannot come to an investigation meeting

The person investigating should ask the witness to write:

e answers to specific questions, where necessary

e their name and, where applicable, job title

e the date, place and time of any relevant issues

e what they saw, heard or know

e the reason why they were able to see, hear or know about the issues
e the date and time of writing their statement

e their signature

The witness should have reasonable time to give the statement.

Talking to a large number of witnesses

If a large number of people witnessed the same incident, the person investigating should:

e talk to some of the witnesses
e check whether they're broadly saying the same thing

The person investigating does not have to talk to all witnesses, unless either of the following apply:

e they feel they're not getting enough information
e there are significant differences in what the witnesses say

Taking records

The person investigating can make audio recordings of interviews or assign a person to take notes, depending on:

e what is most appropriate or possible
e what the organisation's policy or rules allow
e if the person being interviewed agrees

Find out more on recording investigation meetings in the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations.

 

Sharing information and confidentiality

When getting information from a witness, it's a good idea to get their consent to be able to share it if necessary. For example, in case
other people working on the investigation need to look at the information.

The employee under a disciplinary investigation or who has raised a grievance case should be given a copy of any written evidence,
including witness statements.

If someone believes they've been named in a report, they have the right to see any parts that:

Page 7

345


--- New Page 8 ---
Page number: 8
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

e have information about them
e depended on information they gave

They should not be allowed to see private information about other people.

The employer should keep investigation reports for a while, in case there are any questions in the future. How long they keep reports
might be set out in a workplace policy.

If the report includes people's details, the employer should store it securely and only allow access when necessary. Anyone who has
access needs to follow data protection law (UK GDPR).

The report should be securely disposed of once it's no longer needed or is out of date. For example, it could be shredded.

Find out more about data protection on the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) website

 

More advice on carrying out investigations

Read the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations for more on:

 

e interviewing witnesses
e if a witness refuses to give a statement

5. Step 5: After an investigation

If the employer or person investigating feels they need more information, they can go back and investigate again.
They should:

e try to do this in reasonable time
e tell the employee about any delays completing the investigation

Making an investigation report

When there's enough information and the investigation is finished, the employer should have a written report. The employer should
share this report with the employee.

For more help writing investigation reports, you can use:

e the Acas guide to conducting workplace investigations
e our template for investigation reports

 

 

If the employer had a person carrying out the investigation for them, that person can give recommendations for next steps, if this was
agreed in the investigation plan.

Giving recommendations

If the person investigating is to give recommendations at the end of the investigation, they should recommend one of the following:

e formal action
e informal action
e no further action

Page 8

346


--- New Page 9 ---
Page number: 9
Title of ebook of origin: 32.acas_investigations_at_work.pdf

Formal action

Formal action could be:

e to initiate a disciplinary hearing
e changes to an organisation's policy or procedure
e further investigation into other matters that were found

Informal action

Informal action could be:

e training or coaching for parties involved

e counselling for parties involved

e mediation for parties involved

e notification that further similar action might end in disciplinary action

No further action
The outcome of the investigation might be that no further action is needed.

However, the person investigating might still suggest anything that could help the organisation and the people involved, for example:

e counselling
e mediation
e another form of support

Carrying on with the disciplinary or grievance procedure

Now they have more information, the employer should check again if the issue can be resolved informally.

After an investigation, the employer might find there's no evidence to carry on with the disciplinary or grievance procedure. In this case,
they should end the procedure and tell the employee in question there'll be no further action.

The employer might find there's an issue that cannot be resolved informally. In this case they should follow the next steps in the
disciplinary or grievance procedure.

e the disciplinary hearing

Whistleblowing at work

1. The law

Whistleblowing is the action someone takes to report wrongdoing at work that affects others. For example, it could affect the general
public.

Legally this is known as 'making a disclosure in the public interest’.

The action of whistleblowing is sometimes called ‘blowing the whistle’.

Who is protected by law

By law, most people are protected if they make a qualifying disclosure. This includes:

e workers

e employees

e agency workers

e apprentices

e NHS practitioners

e student nurses

e student midwives

¢ police

e office holders

e self-employed doctors, dentists, ophthalmologists and pharmacists working in the NHS

Protection starts from the beginning of employment.
People are still protected even if they no longer work for the employer they're making a disclosure about.

For example, you would still be protected if you believe your previous employer gave an inaccurate job reference because you made a
disclosure when working for them.

Who is not protected by law

People are not usually protected in law if they're:

e genuinely self-employed

e avolunteer with no enforceable employment contract

e anon-executive director

e amember of the armed forces

e asolicitor or barrister learning about an issue covered by professional privilege

e acrown employee dealing with national security — for example, people who work for MI5, MI6 or GCHQ

Page 1

348


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 33.acas_whistleblowing_at_work.pdf

An employer might have a policy that says someone who is not protected by law can still make a disclosure to them. This is usually
because the employer wants to try and resolve problems directly. In these circumstances the person must follow the process in that
policy to make a disclosure.

What the law protects whistleblowers from

By law (the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998), whistleblowers are protected from:

e unfair dismissal — if someone is dismissed for whistleblowing, it will be treated as an automatic unfair dismissal
e detriment

Detriment means someone experiences one or both of the following because they made a disclosure:

e being treated worse than before
e having their situation made worse

Examples of detriment could be:

e their employer reduces their hours

e they experience bullying

e they experience harassment

e their employer turns down their training requests without good reason

If you're legally classed as a worker you cannot claim unfair dismissal. However, you might be able to argue that you being dismissed
was a detriment. This is a complicated area of employment law. If you want to take further action you should get legal advice.

How whistleblowers can claim protection

To claim protection, whistleblowers must show they:

e made a qualifying disclosure
e were dismissed or suffered a detriment as a result of making the disclosure

Find out:

e what someone can make a disclosure about
e how to make a whistleblowing disclosure

 

 

Employment tribunal time limit

You would usually have 3 months from the date of the unfair dismissal or detriment to make a claim to an employment tribunal.

Find out more about making a claim to an employment tribunal

 

2. What someone can whistleblow about

By law, there are several issues you can whistleblow about. These are called ‘qualifying disclosures’.
Qualifying disclosures include:

e acriminal offence — for example, if an employer has been trying to bribe people

Page 2

349


--- New Page 3 ---
Page number: 3
Title of ebook of origin: 33.acas_whistleblowing_at_work.pdf

e the breach of a legal obligation by an organisation — for example, if an employer has neglected their duty of care towards
children in a care home

e amiscarriage of justice — for example, if a member of staff has been fired for something that turned out to be a computer error

e someone's health and safety being in danger — for example, if an employer has forced staff to serve food they know has been
contaminated

e damage to the environment — for example, if an employer has been regularly polluting local rivers

You can also whistleblow about someone trying to cover up information about any of these issues.

You can make a qualifying disclosure about an issue that's happened at any time. This includes if it's likely to happen in the future. It
can also be about something that takes place overseas.

You can report one or more qualifying disclosures.

When a qualifying disclosure is protected

By law, you'll be protected as a whistleblower if you can show it's reasonable for you to believe that what you disclose:

e fits into one of the categories of a qualifying disclosure
e is in the public interest

In the public interest means it has to also affect others. For example other workers, customers or the general public. A problem or
grievance that is personal to only you is unlikely to count as being in the public interest.

Something is more likely to be in the public interest:

e the more serious the issue is

e if you're reporting something that was done deliberately

e if the issue involves a large, influential or well-known employer
e if there are a large number of people affected by the concerns

When you will not be protected

You will not be protected when making a qualifying disclosure if you:

e commit a criminal offence by disclosing the information — for example hacking into computer files
e breach legal professional privilege — for example if you're a legal adviser and learn about something when giving legal advice

In Scotland, legal professional privilege is sometimes called 'confidentiality as between client and professional legal adviser’.

Resolving a personal problem at work

If your concern is a personal problem only and not in the public interest, it will not be covered by whistleblowing law. In these cases
you might be able to resolve the problem another way.

Find out more about how to raise a problem at work

 

Whistleblowing about health and safety breaches

By law (Employment Rights Act 1996), people legally classed as employees or workers are protected if they whistleblow about health

 

and safety.

3. How to make a disclosure

By law (the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998), you can make a whistleblowing disclosure to one of the following:

e your employer

e alegal adviser

e government ministers — this only applies if you work for a statutory body

e another person who is responsible for the wrongdoing

e aprescribed person or body

e any other person or body if there's a good reason to, or if it's related to an ‘exceptionally serious failure’ — for example, the
police or media

You must also make sure your disclosure is made with 'reasonable belief’ and is:

e a qualifying disclosure
e in the public interest

Find out more about what you can whistleblow about

 

Deciding who to make a disclosure to

When making a disclosure, it's good practice to consider the list in order. But there might be cases when you do not want to go to your
employer first.

You will have to meet more requirements if you make a disclosure to someone further down the list. The only exception to this is legal
advisers, who you can speak to at any time.

For example, if you had a health and safety concern, you could make a disclosure to your employer. If the problem is not resolved, you
could then make the same disclosure to the Health and Safety Executive which is a prescribed body.

You might have to give reasons for who you made the disclosure to if the case reaches an employment tribunal.
You can skip people in the list if you think it's not appropriate to disclose to them. But you should consider every option first.

For example, other employees made disclosures to your employer. As a result, they were threatened by managers who they exposed
in the disclosures. You might decide you have no choice but to skip disclosing to your employer.

Your employer

You should consider making the disclosure to your employer first. In most cases this will mean your concerns are dealt with quickly
and by the best person.

You should make it as clear as possible to your employer that you're making a disclosure. You could do this by:

e following the process in your organisation's whistleblowing policy, if there is one
e writing a letter to the most appropriate person in your organisation stating that you're making a disclosure — this might be a line
manager or someone named in your organisation's whistleblowing policy

Your disclosure does not need to be in writing. For example, you could make a disclosure to your employer in a private meeting.
However it's better to put it in writing so you have evidence that you made the disclosure. This could be a letter or an email.

Another person who is responsible for the wrongdoing

You can make a disclosure to another person other than your employer. You must reasonably believe that the wrongdoing relates to
their conduct.

For example, you've been working with a contractor company who you believe is responsible for a health and safety breach. If you
wanted to whistleblow, you could make the disclosure to them instead of your employer.

When you make the disclosure, you must reasonably believe that the person is responsible for the wrongdoing.
Even though you did not make the disclosure to your employer, you would still be protected by whistleblowing law if they:

e dismissed you because you had made the disclosure
e subjected you to detriment because you had made the disclosure

Find out more about the law on whistleblowing

 

A legal adviser

Your disclosure will be protected if you make it to a legal adviser while you're getting legal advice.

A legal adviser will not be protected if they make a disclosure about something they have learnt when giving legal advice.

A prescribed person or body

In some cases you might need to make a disclosure to an official person or body who has responsibility for your concerns. For
example:

e acommissioner

e an auditor

e aregulator

e a government authority

Some of these official bodies are known as a ‘prescribed person or body’. It's easier to be protected as a whistleblower if you raise a
concern with them.

You must make sure that you have picked the correct prescribed person or body to get the most protection. For example, you can
disclose breaches of health and safety regulations to the Health and Safety Executive or an appropriate local authority.

It's also important to follow the instructions given by the prescribed person or body on how to make a disclosure. For example, they
could ask you to fill out a form or call a specific number.

Find out more about the list of prescribed people and bodies on GOV.UK

 

A government minister

A disclosure you make to a government minister will be protected if you work for a:

e government-appointment organisation
e non-departmental public body

Page 5

352


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 33.acas_whistleblowing_at_work.pdf

You can do this either directly or through departmental officials.
Any other person or body related to an exceptionally serious failure

In very rare circumstances you might want to make a disclosure to another person or body about a failure which is exceptionally
serious.

There's no legal definition of what an exceptionally serious failure is. It would be up to a court or employment tribunal to decide whether
it was reasonable for you to make the disclosure.

If you think your situation falls under this, you should consider:

e getting legal advice
e contacting Protect — a UK whistleblowing charity which offers free legal advice

How you can make a disclosure

You should put your disclosure in writing. This could be in an email or a letter.
Some prescribed persons or bodies will also have a number you can call to make a disclosure.
In your disclosure you could include:

e the background and reason behind the concern
e whether you've already raised the concern with anyone else and their response
e any relevant dates

You could also include any relevant evidence, for example documents, photographs, videos or samples. However it's important to
remember that it's not your responsibility to gather evidence. If you take documents or pass them to someone outside your
organisation, you might be in breach of your contract or other laws.

Raising a grievance

It's usually not good practice to make a qualifying disclosure through a grievance to your employer. This is because grievance
procedures are not designed to address these sorts of concerns. You might also lose some confidentiality if you raise your concern this
way.

However, a grievance can be a qualifying disclosure if it contains an appropriate disclosure of information. If you're raising a grievance
you should state that your grievance includes a disclosure.

If you cannot disclose to anyone on the list

If you feel that you cannot make a disclosure to any of the above people or bodies, you should consider:

e getting legal advice

e contacting Protect
e talking to your MP or MSP — they might be able to give advice on who to raise your concern with

4. Responding to a disclosure

As an employer, whistleblowing can help you:

e identify risks and potential wrongdoing
e take action on issues within your organisation

There are several things you should do if an employee or worker makes a whistleblowing disclosure.

Handling a disclosure might seem complicated and take a lot of time. But it can help resolve problems early and stop them from getting
worse.

Follow the right process

It's important to make sure that you:

e handle any whistleblowing complaint fairly and consistently
e follow any process your organisation has for whistleblowing
e keep the identity of the whistleblower confidential

If your organisation has a whistleblowing policy

If you have a whistleblowing policy, you should make sure:

e it's followed whenever a whistleblowing complaint is made

e that staff know about the policy and any procedure to follow

e that all line managers and HR staff are fully trained and up to date with the latest procedures
e you regularly review your processes to check they are effective

If there is no whistleblowing policy

If your organisation does not have a whistleblowing policy you should put one in place as soon as possible.

If you wait until a whistleblowing complaint is made, you might not be as prepared as you could be to handle it. In some cases you
might also miss the opportunity to deal with the situation.

Creating a policy could help you:

e better recognise whistleblowing disclosures

e handle them in a fairer and more consistent way

e identify the ways staff can raise concerns safely outside of their line managers
e reassure your staff that you will listen to and protect whistleblowers

If your organisation has handled a disclosure effectively in the past, you could use that to:

e help decide how to manage any disclosures in the future
e help create a whistleblowing policy

Find out more about having a whistleblowing policy

 

If someone raises a grievance

If someone raises a grievance, you should follow the correct grievance procedure.
If you think a grievance might contain a whistleblowing disclosure, you should check with the person who raised it.

If they are making a disclosure as well as raising a grievance, you might need to follow both the grievance procedure and
whistleblowing procedure.

Someone might try to make a disclosure but raise a grievance by mistake. If this happens, you should check there is nothing in their
complaint they want to address through a grievance procedure. If there is not, you should confirm this in writing, and explain the
grievance procedure has ended and been replaced by your whistleblowing procedure.

Find out more about a formal grievance procedure

 

If the concern is a personal problem

You might find your employee or worker's concern is a personal problem and does not fall within whistleblowing law. You should still try
and find a way to resolve it.

Before dealing with the problem another way, make sure the concern is not whistleblowing.

If you think the concern is not a whistleblowing disclosure, explain this to the person who raised it. This is so they can make their
disclosure to someone else if they still think it is whistleblowing.

Find out more about dealing with a problem raised by an employee

 

Take the disclosure seriously

Always take whistleblowing disclosures seriously.
If you have a policy, follow the correct procedures and:

e listen to any concerns that your staff have raised

e consider what evidence might be available to support the concern

e reassure the whistleblower that you will keep their identity confidential

e reassure the whistleblower they will not suffer any detriment for raising concerns

e try and answer any questions the whistleblower has and explain why you cannot answer them if not
e keep the whistleblower informed about the progress of any investigation into their disclosure

e provide feedback to the whistleblower after any investigation, explaining if action has been taken

You should also train managers on whistleblowing procedures and how to respond to disclosures.
Make sure the whistleblower does not experience detriment

You must not cause an employee ‘detriment’ if they make a disclosure. Detriment means someone experiences one or both of the
following because they made a disclosure:

e being treated worse than before
e having their situation made worse

Page 8

355


--- New Page 9 ---
Page number: 9
Title of ebook of origin: 33.acas_whistleblowing_at_work.pdf

Examples of detriment could be:

e reducing their hours

e causing them to experience bullying

e causing them to experience harassment

e turning down their training requests without good reason

Vicarious liability

If someone is bullied or harassed by others at work, it might be treated as if carried out by:

e the employer
e the person who carried out the bullying or harassment
e both the employer and the person

This could make you responsible for their actions. This is known as ‘vicarious liability’.

It could also be vicarious liability if someone is bullied or harassed by a person who does not work with them. For example, a family
member of the employer or a contractor.

Find out more about handling a bullying or harassment complaint at work

 

Non-disclosure agreements

As an employer, you might use a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to stop someone who works for you from sharing information.
By law, having a non-disclosure agreement in place cannot stop someone from whistleblowing.

Find out more about non-disclosure agreements

 

Get more advice and support

If you have any questions about whistleblowing you can contact:

e the Acas helpline — for more advice on whistleblowing and resolving problems at work

e Protect — a UK whistleblowing charity which offers free legal advice and supports employers to develop best practice
whistleblowing arrangements

e the National Guardian's Office — for advice on speaking up in the NHS

Acas also offers tailored support for employers to address specific challenges in an organisation.

5. Having a policy

It's a good idea for your organisation to have a policy that covers whistleblowing.
A policy can help show:

e staff the most effective way to raise their concerns when making a disclosure
e how managers should respond

As an employer you should support everyone to follow the whistleblowing policy. You should:

Page 9

356


--- New Page 10 ---
Page number: 10
Title of ebook of origin: 33.acas_whistleblowing_at_work.pdf

e share the policy across the whole organisation

e regularly review it

e use it as the basis for any whistleblowing training for managers
e show it to and discuss it with staff regularly

e include it in any employee induction process

If your organisation has any recognised trade unions you should work with them when developing and reviewing any policy. You
should also check if your organisation has a joint agreement with the trade unions that requires you to do this.

It's also important to make sure your organisation has a culture where people:

e trust their management
e feel safe and encouraged to speak to them about serious concerns

What a whistleblowing policy should include

A whistleblowing policy should cover:

e what whistleblowing is and how it differs from a grievance

e how it can affect employees and managers

e who the point of contact is in the organisation for whistleblowing queries

e how an employee should raise a whistleblowing disclosure

e astatement making clear the organisation wants to encourage all staff to make disclosures to them when they have concerns
e how the organisation will not tolerate whistleblowers experiencing detriment because they raised a concern

e how the organisation will investigate and respond to disclosures

e what whistleblowing support is available to staff

e how the organisation is open and trained to deal with whistleblowing

If you need support creating a whistleblowing policy, it's a good idea to get legal advice.

7 Anti-Patterns of Terraform: Why Not to Skip Modularity

Terraform's power lies in its ability to manage infrastructure as code. However, neglecting
modularity can lead to spaghetti code and maintenance headaches. Here's why a non-
modular approach can be detrimental, explained with relatable analogies:

1. The Monolithic Monster: One Terraform File to Rule Them All

¢ Analogy: Imagine building a skyscraper with a single blueprint. Changes in
One section affect the entire structure.
¢ Terraform Antidote: Break down infrastructure into smaller, reusable modules
representing specific functionalities. This promotes maintainability and easier
updates. (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)
2. The Chained Reactions: Domino Effect of Terraform Code

¢ Analogy: Picture a row of dominoes. Pushing one topples all. A change in
one interdependent resource can trigger unintended consequences
throughout the infrastructure.

¢ Terraform Antidote: Define clear dependencies between resources using
depends_on meta-arguments. This isolates changes and prevents
cascading failures.
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/

dependencies)
3. The Code Cobweb: Tangled Dependencies in Terraform

¢ Analogy: Imagine a tangled web of cobwebs. Tracing connections and
making modifications becomes a nightmare. Intertwined resources in
Terraform code create similar complexity.
¢ Terraform Antidote: Use well-defined modules with clear inputs and outputs.
This promotes loose coupling and simplifies dependency management.
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs )
4. The Copy-Paste Catastrophe: Duplicating Terraform Code

¢ Analogy: Imagine replicating the same paragraph throughout a book. Edits
become tedious and error-prone. Copying Terraform code for similar
resources leads to redundancy and maintenance difficulties.
¢ Terraform Antidote: Leverage Terraform modules for reusable configurations.
This eliminates duplication and simplifies updates across the infrastructure.
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)
5. The Hardcoded Horror: Embedding Sensitive Data in Terraform

¢ Analogy: Imagine writing your password on every login page. It's risky and
impractical. Hardcoding secrets like API keys directly in Terraform code
poses security vulnerabilities.

¢ Terraform Antidote: Utilize Terraform Cloud Workspaces and state
management with backend stores like Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. This
secures sensitive information and facilitates collaboration.
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces)

358

Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 34.seven_anti_patterns_of_terraform__why_not_to_skip_modularity.pdf

6. The Remote State Swamp: Centralized State Management Woes

¢ Analogy: Imagine everyone in a city sharing a single mailbox. Chaos ensues.
Storing Terraform state remotely in a single location creates a bottleneck and
potential data loss risks.
¢ Terraform Antidote: Consider backend options like Terraform Cloud or remote
state with S3 bucket versioning. This distributes state management and
improves reliability. (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)
7. The Testing Tightrope: Fragile Infrastructure Testing

¢ Analogy: Imagine testing a complex machine by poking individual
components. It's inefficient and misses interactions. Testing monolithic
Terraform code can be cumbersome and miss edge cases.

¢ Terraform Antidote: Embrace infrastructure as code testing tools like Terratest
or Kitchen. These tools facilitate automated and modular testing of Terraform
configurations. (You can find more information on Terratest at
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest and Kitchen Cl at
https://www.americastestkitchen.com/)

 

By adopting a modular approach with these considerations in mind, you can build resilient,
maintainable, and secure infrastructure with Terraform. Remember, clear separation of
concerns and well-defined dependencies are key to Terraform mastery

Best Practices for Structuring Terraform
Projects with Multiple VPCs

Introduction

Imagine orchestrating a vast symphony, akin to managing multiple Virtual Private Clouds
(VPCs) across AWS regions. This scenario requires a harmonious and structured
approach, much like conducting a musical performance with different sections. This guide
explores the recommended modular approach for managing Terraform code, reflecting the
complexity and coordination of a symphony.

Clarity and Organization

Analogy: Think of the orderliness of a library, facilitating easy location of genres or
authors, contrasted with disarray.

Solution & Reference: Implement a filing system for your Terraform code, similar to a
library's organization. This ensures project clarity and order. Marcel Zehner provides
detailed insights at https://marcelzehner.ch/2019/05/25/terraform-using-multiple-files-for-
configurations-and-variables/.

Reusability and Modularity

Analogy: Envision a kitchen's organization, where ingredients are stored in clear, reusable
containers for efficiency.

Solution & Reference: Utilize reusable Terraform modules for infrastructure patterns, akin
to a well-stocked kitchen. This promotes efficiency and consistency. More on this approach
can be found in the Modern Technologist Guide at
https://moderntechnologist.com/provisioning-vpcs-using-terraform-vpc-module-step-by-
step-guide-for-common-use-cases/.

Reduced Complexity

Analogy: Compare the coherence of a well-structured essay to the confusion of a text
wall.

Solution & Reference: Organize your Terraform into focused files, paralleling an essay's
structure. This facilitates easier updates and comprehension. Insights can be gained from
https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/multiple-plan-apply-stages-terraform/20572.

 

Improved Team Collaboration

Analogy: Reflect on the efficiency of a relay race, with each participant contributing to the
final outcome.

368


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 35.best_practices_for_structuring_terraform_projects.pdf

Solution & Reference: Distribute Terraform tasks among team members, mirroring a relay
race's teamwork. Effective strategies for this are outlined at FreeCodeCamp:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-basic-terraform-syntax-in-20-minutes/.

Better State Management

Analogy: Similar to individual accounts for distinct financial goals, separate state files offer
clearer oversight.

Solution & Reference: Apply distinct state files for different environments, akin to using
separate accounts for financial management. Charity Majors discusses this in depth at
https://charity.wtf/2016/03/30/terraform-vpc-and-why-you-want-a-tfstate-file-per-env/.

 

Conclusion

Adopting a modular approach for Terraform, especially in multi-VPC AWS region projects,
is akin to orchestrating a grand musical performance or managing a well-structured library.
By implementing best practices, your infrastructure becomes as orderly, scalable, and
maintainable as possible, ensuring smoother operations and enhanced collaboration.

These methodologies are not just about maintaining order; they empower your team to
build and manage infrastructure with the clarity, precision, and harmony of a well-
conducted symphony.

-some users want to stick to passwords at all cost (even though ssh keys are prefered): so these users will have their account and secure passwords generated for them
-some others that are making use of ssh keys do take for ever to generate them so those interested wont have to stress about this anymore.
For example, when you take Amazon EC2 instances, both private and public keys are generated for the users so none of them has to stress about generating anything.It is all about streamlining things here and easing things for end users. However, if some users want to generate their own set of keys, no problem but you can be sure that most of them will be happy having the heavy lifting done on their behalf.

I'm not sure where that information came from, maybe there's been some crossed wires - we don't need to generate passwords in the code as we'll just supply those as vaulted vars in the ansible. We would never generate keys for people as the private key should realistically never leave the machine it is generate on. So we do need the users to generate their own keys as it is the public part they need to send to us.
What amazon do when setting up EC2 instances is an exceptional case, and I know you can supply your own public key rather than have them generate one
Happy to get on a call and explain/get you started on the ansible

Lawyers suspect Arnold Clark hackers have now leaked 45GB of personal data on dark
web

Lawyers assisting victims of the recent Arnold Clark cyber hack believe that an additional 30GB of personal data has been
leaked on the dark web.

Car Dealer reported earlier this year that bya

gang of criminal hackers.

Keller Postman — a top firm of London lawyers — has since launched a to help victims of the recent
breach claim compensation.

Speaking exclusively to Car Dealer, the law firm revealed it now believes as much as 45GB of personal data has been leaked on to
the dark web.

Lawyer Bill Singer, an associate with Keller Postman, said the amount was still a tiny percentage of the total data, which is

alleged to have been seized from Arnold Clark by hackers’ collective Play.
‘This is certainly something that bears mentioning,’ he said.
‘There has been a huge amount of interest in the media — and rightfully so — about the first post of 15GB and how it includes

extensive personal data like passports and National Insurance numbers, but there has since been a second post of 30GB of data

to the dark web which has not attracted as much coverage.’

When the breach initially took place on December 23, Arnold Clark claimed that there was ‘no evidence of customer

information being compromised’.

However, the dealer group later said that names, dates of birth, vehicle information, contact details and National Insurance

numbers had been stolen by hackers.
Since then, the most profitable car dealer group in the UK has been informing customers who have been affected.

However, rather than doing this all at once, it has contacted customers at different stages, making it difficult for Keller Postman

to know exactly how many people have been affected.

Singer said an ‘educated guess’ placed the number of victims in the tens of thousands or even above 100,000, and predicted that

it would take months for everyone who wants to make a claim to be notified by the company and come forward.

From there, it could take some time for a resolution to be found, although an out-of-court settlement could be reached before the

case has to be heard by a judge.
Dealer groups: ‘Soft target’

The attack on Arnold Clark is the latest in a long line of cyber attacks involving major dealer groups in recent years.

Last year, Pendragon was subject to a similar attack by hackers demanding payment of $60m.

In February, Robin Luscombe told the Car Dealer Podcast that dealers were ‘defenceless’ against ‘an industry of fraudsters
and scammers’.

However, Singer believes that the industry could be doing more to protect its customers’ data and questioned whether

businesses were ‘soft targets’ for illegal groups.

‘This is the latest in a long line of attacks on car dealership groups and they are not doing it because it is unprofitable to them,’
he told Car Dealer.

He added: ‘Dealerships are being subject to successful cyber attacks where huge amounts of data gets stolen year after year. It’s

usually phishing attacks into ransomware, leading to loss of data and bribes being demanded, like in the case of Arnold Clark.

‘This is the fifth attack on a car dealership group in the past three years and despite that it would appear to be business as usual

for some companies.’

Since the attack, Arnold Clark has publicly announced that it is rebuilding its systems in a safe manner and it says it takes its

duty to protect customer data seriously.

Car Dealer has contacted Arnold Clark for comment.

ABOUT ¥ GROUP ACTIONS v- HAS YOUR DATA BEEN BREACHED? v

At KP Law, we believe that a mammoth data breach event has happened, yet the full eee see eee keene

extent of how this breach affects Arnold Clark customers may take months to become
clear. Nevertheless, over the last few weeks we have started to see a significant rise in
fraud reports being made following the data theft and dark web posts.

 

To date, the process of notifying customers has taken months, and many Arnold Clark Recent Posts

customers still have not received notification of a data breach. As we publish this article,

we have seen no evidence that Arnold Clark has begun notifying those customer's whose Keller Postman UK merges with Lanier,
data has recently been published on the dark web. This lack of communication from Longstaff, Hedar & Roberts to form
Arnold Clark leaves these customers exposed to fraud. We highly recommend anyone specialist collective redress law firm KP
who has been a customer of Arnold Clark over the last 10 years - and perhaps even Law Limited

before that - to take immediate steps to protect themselves. Find out how to do this

here.

We also believe that failures to adopt standard security measures may have made this
attack easier. As such, we have launched a group action to help affected customers in
England & Wales claim compensation. We currently represent in excess of 7,500
customers and are helping them to seek information and redress.

Some organisations use self-destructing emails to automatically delete communications,
either after a certain amount of time or when they request it. We do not condone this
practice, especially in data breach cases where notification is widely used to prove an
individual's involvement in a breach and is thus vital evidence when making a claim. While
we cannot be sure if Arnold Clark has set its emails to self-destruct, we have seen this
happen in other cases. As such, we advise anyone who receives a data breach notification
to keep a copy just in case.

(?) How did the Arnold Clark data hack happen?

Arnold Clark experienced a cyber security incident on 23rd December 2022. This is
reported to have been carried out by the Play ransomware cartel. On 28 January 2023,
Arnold Clark released a statement about the attack. In this, the company appears to admit
that, while its IT systems are capable of being set up so that they are not vulnerable to
external attacks, work to achieve this started after the hack. Did Arnold Clark unwittingly
admit that poor data security made this hack possible?

A failure to adopt standard security measures often makes such attacks possible. If
Arnold Clark did not have adequate protections in place, it must be held responsible for
any loss or distress experienced by its customers because of this breach.

Why did Arnold Clark delay telling customers
about the breach?

It is not yet clear why Arnold Clark did not notify its customers “without undue delay”,
which it should have done. As far as our data protection solicitors can tell, there is no
good reason for this delay. By not letting customers know about the risk immediately,
Arnold Clark left them at a very high risk of further cyberattacks, fraud and identity
theft.

attack. Our external security network consultants alerted us to unusual activity on our
network, and we immediately took steps to minimize the impact of the attack by removing all
external connections to our network to protect our customer data, third-party partners and
our systems.

‘While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of
our investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to
steal copies of some data that we hold. Due to the type of cyber attack that we have been
subjected to, it is extremely difficult to accurately identify what has been stolen; however, our
teams are working with our external advisors to understand the exact nature and extent of
that data.

‘While this crime and theft of data has been targeted towards Arnold Clark, we recognise the
impact this could have on our partners and customers. We take their safety and the safety of
their data very seriously, therefore while further analysis is ongoing, we are taking the
following steps now:

e We are setting up a dedicated call/help centre with our partners Experian to help those
affected, or potentially affected, with more information.

e We are writing to all affected and potentially affected customers and will continue that
communication as our investigation progresses.

e We will provide regular cyber security updates on our websites.

Identity fraud victims Suzanne and David McDermott in Alloway last week

Car sales giant Arnold Clark is facing multi-million-pound group action claims from
thousands of customers following a data breach, we can reveal.

The firm suffered a cyber attack just before Christmas and customers’ personal
information has since been published on the dark web.

At the time, bosses insisted that information was safe but later conceded personal
data had been compromised.

392

Title of ebook of origin: 41.thousand_launch_multi_million_pounds_action_over_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

Now a number of legal firms have launched schemes to help victims.

Data protection laws state that people can claim compensation from any
organisation that breaches those laws, including for any damage or distress caused.

Solicitors Thompsons told The Sunday Post it had been approached by more than
5,000 people who have received a letter from Arnold Clark advising them that their
personal data had been compromised.

Patrick McGuire, a partner at the firm, said: “I think this is the tip of the iceberg. The
most financially sensitive data has been posted on the dark web and certainly
includes data that would allow criminals to steal people’s identities and open
fraudulent bank accounts. Our clients are understandably very worried.”

Solicitors Jones Whyte, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, said it had also been
contacted by more than 1,000 people who may have been affected and that this
number was “continuing to rise by the day”.

Associate Dominic Ritchie, who heads up the data breach claim for the firm, said:
“We are in the process of building a strong case and will be looking for significant
compensation from Arnold Clark for our clients.”

Customers were emailed in late January about the UK-wide hack that happened on
December 23. The company said it closed down its entire computer network on
Christmas Eve.

The details held by the firm are believed to include copies of passports and drivers’
licences. Names, dates of birth, vehicle details, contact details and National
Insurance numbers could also have been taken.

Arnold Clark, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, has almost 200 dealerships
across Scotland and England. It has not said how many customers have been
contacted. Those affected have been offered a two-year subscription to an identity-
fraud-checking service.

The company said it had taken several steps to protect partners and customers
following the cyber attack, including setting up a call centre with its credit reporting
agency partners Experian.

“Upon advice from our cyber security team, we understand that some personal data
has been extracted by the hackers who carried out the cyber attack,” the company
told customers.

“We take the protection of your personal data extremely seriously, and we want to
assure you we are doing everything we can to minimise any risk to you from this

incident.”

Laura McGee, head of personal injury at legal firm NewLaw Scotland, said: “We
have set up cases for each of our clients and claims have been intimated to Arnold
Clark. They have, in turn, instructed their own solicitors to investigate the breach and
the damage it has caused. It is hoped that Arnold Clark will adequately compensate
those affected. However if matters cannot be resolved it is likely that group
proceedings will be brought in court to seek justice for the distress, anxiety and
financial losses suffered by the victims.”

McGee added: “Unfortunately, | anticipate there could be thousands of victims in
Scotland.”

London-based Keller Postman, which has launched a “no win, no fee” scheme for
claimants, said it had been contacted by more than 7,500 potential victims across
the UK, including a number from Scotland. Bill Singer, an associate at the firm, said:
“We have established that more than half a terabyte of Arnold Clark customer data
has now been exposed on the dark web — as a car dealership, this means highly
sensitive records such as addresses, contact information, payment information,
drivers’ licences and passports are available online.

“Our clients are already reporting a range of fraudulent activity stemming from this
breach, including current account banking fraud, cloned debit cards, blocked
transactions, identity theft, repeated credit checks triggered by unknown fraudsters,
phishing emails and scam instant messages.”

Companies caught up in data breaches can also be hit with large fines by the
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). It fined British Airways a record £20 million
after the personal data of more than 400,000 customers and staff was stolen in
2020.

The ICO said: “Arnold Clark made us aware of an incident and we are making
inquiries.”

Police Scotland said inquiries into the data breach were ongoing.

Arnold Clark said: “As soon as we knew who had been affected or potentially
affected, we notified them and advised them on how to protect themselves against
fraudulent activity, including providing two years’ free Identity Plus from Experian.

“Since the incident occurred, we have also engaged on a regular basis with the
police and ICO.”

David and Suzanne McDermott

A couple who have been the victims of identity fraud believe they were targeted by
crooks in the wake of the Arnold Clark data breach.

David and Suzanne McDermott, from Alloway, South Ayrshire, were shocked when
they started receiving late payment reminders in February from communications
company O2, claiming they hadn't paid bills totalling more than £2,000 for items
such as an iPad, an iPhone and associated mobile phone contracts.

The letters came shortly after the couple had received emails from Arnold Clark
informing them that their personal details may have been compromised in the data
breach that happened just before Christmas.

“We have never had an account with 02, so we couldn’t understand what this was all
about,” said McDermott, a 51-year-old dad of three.

“Then we started getting demands from debt collectors, but we knew nothing about
these alleged debts and associated defaults. It has been a nightmare.”

The McDermotts subsequently discovered their credit ratings had been significantly
downgraded as a result and their credit card spending limits slashed — in one case,
from £10,000 to just £300.

“We couldn't understand how this could have happened, then we remembered the
emails from Arnold Clark that we received around the same time as this all started,
informing us that our details were at risk, including bank information,” he added.

“Both my wife and | had vehicles with Arnold Clark previously and we believe that it
is no coincidence that, soon after we were told about this data breach, our details

397


--- New Page 7 ---
Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 41.thousand_launch_multi_million_pounds_action_over_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

were being used by fraudsters.”

McDermott, an aerospace engineer, said that, because of the impact on his credit
rating, he was forced to pay a higher interest rate to buy a new car and worried that
this could also affect work he undertakes for the Ministry of Defence.

The couple reported the incidents to O2, who opened a fraud case, and they also
contacted Police Scotland. “The police were sympathetic but said nothing could be
done because we hadn’t had any money physically stolen from us at that stage,”
David said.

When The Sunday Post contacted 02, the company moved swiftly to cancel the
bogus accounts and said it would have the McDermotts’ credit records amended.

O2 said: “They will no longer receive letters requesting any payments.”

Police Scotland confirmed it had been contacted by the couple but declined to
comment on any possible connection with the Arnold Clark data breach.

It said: “On March 5, 2023, we received a report relating to identity fraud. Suitable
advice was given.”

FAN... could face paying out millions to customers after personal
data was stolen in a cyber attack.

We told how the car retailer was targeted by hackers in a large-scale data
breach on December 23 last year.

included bank account details, home addresses, copies of passports
emails and national insurance numbers.

 

Under data protection laws, customers affected by poor cyber security
can claim compensation.

Solicitors Thompsons said it has been approached by more than 5,000
customers affected by the data breach.

Patrick McGuire, a partner at the firm, said: "I think that this is the tip of
the iceberg.

identities and open fraudulent bank accounts. Our clients are
understandably very worried."

The amount of compensation affected customers will receive depends on
the injury that the person suffers.

Mr McGuire added: "Some will suffer distress, which is bad enough. Their
claims may be valued at a few thousand pounds. Some of our clients have
suffered mental trauma and require medical treatment.

"Their claims will be worth a lot more. There may then be the people who
have fraudulent accounts opened in their names who may also suffer
financial loss and damage to their credit ratings."

"| would advise anyone affected to regularly check their credit file and
contact a solicitor to discuss what remedies are open to them against
Arnold Clark."

Meanwhile, Glasgow-based solicitors Jones Whyte said data breaches can
have a "devastating" impact on those affected.

Head of Group Action, Dominic Ritchie, said: "Organisations have a legal
duty to securely store and process the information they hold on you,
unfortunately, often negligent practices and poor cyber security can
result in these details being disclosed.

"This can have a devastating effect on the victim when their personal
information has been exposed. We believe that on this occasion Arnold
Clark has fallen short and the affected customers are entitled to financial
compensation for the loss and distress caused."

Arnold Clark said it takes data security "very seriously" and has advised
customers on how to protect themselves against fraudulent activity.

A spokesperson said: "While this crime and theft of data has been inflicted
on Arnold Clark, along with many other organisations this year, we
recognise the impact this can have on our partners and customers.

"We take the safety of their data very seriously, and while undergoing
investigations, we took several proactive steps to ensure the best possible
protection for them.

"As soon as we knew who had been affected or potentially affected, we
notified them and advised them on how to protect themselves against
fraudulent activity, including providing 2 years’ free Identity Plus from
Experian.

Housands of people whose personal data was efiltrated

and publicly leaked by the Play ransomware gang following a
cyber attack on the systems of nationwide car dealer
network Arnold Clark in 2022 are now coming forward to
participate in what may become one of the largest group

action law suits yet seen in the KI

He incident began on 23 December 2022 _, and its initial
impact saw Arnold Clark dealers forced to resort to pen and
paper to record transactions, while hundreds of people who

had been hoping to collect their new cars were left

temporarily disappointed.

The Glasgow-based firm, which is one of the UK’s largest
and longest-established family-owned car dealers, initially
said that its customers’ data was safe.

However, on 22 January 2023, the Mail on
Sunday revealed that this was not the case after a 15GB
tranche of data was leaked on the dark web by Play.

This data included customer photo identification, passport
data, banking data, dates of birth and home addresses,
among other things.

Shortly afterwards, Arnold Clark acknowledged that it had
been the victim of data exfiltration, and at the end of January
2023, the organisation began the process of sending
notifications to its customers in staggered batches.

A few weeks later, in mid-February, a further 30GB of data
was posted, followed by the full data dump, totaling almost
470GB, at the end of March.

The action is being spearheaded by Keller Postman, a law

413


--- New Page 15 ---
Page number: 15
Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

firm that specialises in helping cyber incident victims get

redress — although other actions are in progress.

Connor Hewitt, who works in the cyber security sector, is
among those to have joined Keller Postman’s group action

as a Client.

Hewitt bought a car from Arnold Clark a few years ago and
as part of the sale provided extensive personally identifiable
information (PII) to the car dealership to enable it to conduct
due diligence and credit checks. He was informed that his
data had been leaked in mid-February, a few weeks after the
Mail on Sunday broke the story.

“| remember getting the notification — | was in the gym and |
remember the email popping up,” said Hewitt. “It basically
said we believe your data was included in a data breach.”

Hewitt was only mildly concerned at this stage, as the Mail’s
story generated some discussion within a work-based group
chat of which he is a member. The group shares breach
information to help him and his colleagues have more
informed conversations about cyber security with their

customers.

“Obviously that article came out and the first thing that came
into my head was, ‘I bought a car from them, | wonder if my
information is part of that breach.’ And then...| got the email
to say my information was part of that,” he said.

Hewitt says he has seen multiple fraud attempts being made
against him since then. “It’s not been too bad because | can
spot them quite easily based on the work | do — | do phishing

training all the time with customers,” he said.

“There have been spikes in...the likes of Instagram, direct
messages with links, spikes in Facebook friend requests —
again, slightly dodgy ones. There have been 30, maybe
pushing 40, credit checks done against me. I’ve had text
messages off companies trying to say, ‘You've got parcels
being delivered, please check this parcel”, and all that kind of
stuff. Sometimes that happens when you have ordered

something, as well.”

Many of these fraud attempts were extremely crude and
easily spotted, but many have been quite sophisticated, and
Hewitt said he was keenly aware that thousands of less
technology-savvy people caught up in the incident have not
been so lucky.

Indeed, Arnold Clark-linked frauds are now popping up all
over the UK, said Keller Postman associate solicitor Bill
Singer.

“Numerous clients have uncovered evidence of identity theft,
for example, unauthorised credit checks, sometimes dozens
a day. Other clients have actually reported fraud going
through,” said Singer.

“Huge numbers of them are experiencing an elevated level
of fraud attempts, a whole variety of phishing, social media
messages, text messages. Lots have had cold calls as well —
for example, bogus calls from their bank’s fraud department.
They are seeing a wide variety of cyber criminal activity.”

Singer said it was not possible to put a figure on what the
average loss per claimant might be, but in instances where
frauds have been successful, they have ranged in value from
Direct Debits for a few pounds being set up on victims’ bank
accounts, to attempts to obtain high value items and

services, many of which have been successful.

One claimant, somewhat ironically, found that their identity
had been stolen when a letter arrived at their house from a

416


--- New Page 18 ---
Page number: 18
Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

Volkswagen dealer, congratulating them on the purchase of
a £38,000 Golf, which was most assuredly not parked on
their driveway.

“Whether the fraud is small or large it has the same
consequences,” said Singer. “You still need to get your
money back. You still need to spend extra time protecting
yourself against future frauds. You might have an impacted
credit score — | have clients who have been refused credit on

new cars due to all of these identity theft attempts.”

Those affected are being urged to come forward to join more
than 10,000 people who have already signed up as potential
claimants. More details can be found on Keller Postman’s
website.

Singer told Computer Weekly the case against Arnold Clark
is still in the evidence-gathering phase prior to potential court
proceedings, but the solicitors have alleged liability and put
forward their claim to Arnold Clark. They are currently

waiting on its response.

Keller Postman and its clients are also awaiting the outcome

of the Information Commissioner's Office’s (ICO’s)

417


--- New Page 19 ---
Page number: 19
Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

investigation into whether or not Arnold Clark has breached
any of its statutory obligations under the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

“We will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the ICO
investigation. We [also] Know the ICO is investigating at least
one complaint from Arnold Clark customers who have been
dissatisfied with the [response to the] data breach,” said
Singer.

“The ICO has very heavy fining powers [and] we would
expect a broad fine if any breaches are upheld, but what
they can’t do is award any compensation to individual

customers who complain.”

For Hewitt, the ideal outcome would be for Arnold Clark to
admit and accept liability over the breach, but also to fairly
compensate those affected.

“Although I’m in a position where | can see the threats as
they are...there will be people who will fall for phishing as
people do. It can be scary for a lot of people who will see
them and not really understand what’s happening,” he said.

Singer added: “The whole essence of the case is that Arnold

Clark could and should have done more.”

Computer Weekly contacted Arnold Clark’s press office for
comment on the ongoing investigation, but the organisation

had not responded at the time of publication.

Arnold Clark Data Breach

Cyber attacks and successful data breaches have
become more and more commonplace over the
years. Even large companies have found themselves
under attack, sometimes leading to millions of
people losing their information and resulting in large
compensation payouts.

As for Arnold Clark, their failure to protect their
customer data has resulted in over a million people
losing many details, some of which have been
rumoured to be financial and personal details.

Have you been an Arnold Clark customer in the last
three years? If so, we advise you to check if you
have been affected by the hacking incident in late
2022. You could also be owed compensation. Click

the link and we'll check if you qualify for up to

Why are people making
compensation claims against
Arnold Clark?

Arnold Clark is a popular car dealership business in
the UK. On December 23rd 2022, hackers bypassed
the company’s security systems and stole the
personal information of over 1.1 million customers. At
first, Arnold Clark claims that they had been advised
that no personal information had been accessed via
the leak and continued as normal.

However, in the following weeks, cyber hackers
contacted Arnold Clark with threats to release the
information they had stolen if they did not pay a
ransom. Arnold Clark did not give in to the demands,

423


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

and soon after, the following information was spread
across the dark web:

e Names

e Addresses

e Phone Numbers

e Email Addresses

e Vehicle Details

e Bank Details (Sort code and account number)

 

Questions began to arise as to why it was that the
information was able to be accessed in the first
place.

What makes me eligible for an Arnold Clark Data Breach
Compensation claim?

You may think that you need to have lost out financially because of the breach in order to make a
claim, but this isn’t the case. For many people that having their privacy violated in ways such as

424


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

this, this can be highly distressing and thus constitute a reason to claim for damages. Arnold Clark
had the legal duty to make sure that no unauthorised third parties had access to private customer
information held by them.

Finding out if you qualify is easy, and takes less than a minute of your time. All you need to do is
click the button and fill in a few easy details. We will introduce you to legal specialists who will get
in contact with you to explore your claim potential and discuss the best way forward.

We will help you get the best possible representation. You don’t have to worry about paying
anything up front to make a claim, as all of the lawyers we introduce you to work on a no-win, no-
fee basis.

On the 28th of January, Arnold Clark released a statement: tT

“On the evening of 23 December 2022, Arnold Clark Automobiles was a victim of a cyber attack. Our
external security network consultants alerted us to unusual activity on our network, and we
immediately took steps to minimise the impact of the attack by removing all external connections to
our network to protect our customer data, third-party partners and our systems.

“While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of our
investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to steal copies of
some data that we hold. Due to the type of cyber attack that we have been subjected to, it is
extremely difficult to accurately identify what has been stolen; however, our teams are working with
our external advisors to understand the exact nature and extent of that data.

“While this crime and theft of data has been targeted towards Arnold Clark, we recognise the impact
this could have on our partners and customers. We take their safety and the safety of their data very

425


--- New Page 7 ---
Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

seriously, therefore while further analysis is ongoing, we are taking the following steps now:

e We are setting up a dedicated call/help centre with our partners Experian to help those affected, or
potentially affected, with more information.

e We are writing to all affected and potentially affected customers and will continue that
communication as our investigation progresses.

e We will provide regular cyber security updates on our websites.

e We will offer our affected and potentially affected customers 24 months’ fraud/credit protection
with Experian free of charge.
During this incident, we have been in constant communication with the regulatory authorities and
have sought useful guidance from the police, and we will continue to do so to help other companies
learn from our experience and be better prepared for possible situations such as this.

As a result of this incident, we have taken the decision to rebuild our networks in a new segregated
environment, which has meant that our operational systems are not yet fully functional, so we
apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers.

If you need to contact us about this incident, you can do so by contacting Arnold Clark Customer
Services (https://www.arnoldclark.com/contact/customer-services).“

Two elements within the statement have raised alarm bells. By admitting that they did not
segregate their network, they also confirm they were lax in their efforts to maintain an acceptable
level of standard in security systems. Also, should they have not been at fault at all, they would
have no reason to lose further capital by offering such a long-lasting premium service for free.

As a result, plenty of affected customers have been looking to claim compensation against the

Customer details exposed following
Arnold Clark data breach

Car dealer Arnold Clark have contacted customers to inform them of
the details of a data breach following a cyber security incident at the
end of 2022.

In a letter to affected customers, Arnold Clark confirmed that they were subject
to a cyber-attack on 23 December 2022, involving the personal data which was
stored on their network.

The attack saw an unauthorised third-party gain access to data including:

e Names

¢ Contact details

e Dates of birth

e Vehicle details

e ID documents (such as passports and drivers’ licences)
e National insurance numbers

e Bank account details

Arnold Clark's cyber security team have advised that this data was extracted by
the hackers responsible for the attack.

This is supported by recent reports which have provided further context to the
attack. The Mail on Sunday recently reported that an individual claiming

association with the ransomware cartel Play has posted a 15GB tranche of

434


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 44.customer_details_exposed_following_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

customer data from the incident on to the dark web.

Arnold Clark have previously commented on the breach, issuing a statement to
Automotive Management. However, the company declined to speak on the

ransom demand.

“We take the security and safety of our customer data very seriously and
accurate identification of any potential compromise of that data remains our
primary focus." The statement read.

“Once we have a full picture of all the data that is potentially compromised, we

will be contacting our customers to make them aware."

If you have been contacted by Arnold Clark and have been informed that your
data has been compromised in the breach, you may be able to make a

compensation claim.

At Hayes Connor, our specialist data breach solicitors are currently advising
Arnold Clark customers on their rights for making a claim for compensation. We
are also ready to provide expert advice and guidance to anyone else who has
been affected.

To find out more about whether you will be in a position to make a claim and
how to get started, please get in touch.

What to do if you are concerned about
the Arnold Clark data breach

If your personal data has been compromised following the cyber-attack on
Arnold Clark, the company should have taken the steps to get in touch with you.
That being said, we know all too well that mistakes can be made. If you are yet

breached, the first step to take will be to get in touch with them as soon as
possible.

Following any sort of data breach, you should always be vigilant when receiving
unexpected communications, especially where they appear to be from someone
claiming to represent Arnold Clark. There is a chance that these could be
sophisticated ‘phishing attacks’ which are designed to extract further personal
information from you.

There are several ways to reduce the risk of cybercriminals using your personal
data against you. To find out more about this, read our helpful guide on what to
do if your data has been stolen in a data breach.

 

If your data has been compromised in the Arnold Clark data breach, you may be
entitled to compensation. This is something the team at Hayes Connor can help
you with.

Arnold Clark data breach leads to
identity theft

By Naveen Goud

 

A few days ago, the servers of car dealer ‘Arnold Clark’ were breached by
hackers and the information of 1000sof motorists was stolen that can lead to
identity thefts and online frauds. The threat actors are adamant in their
demand for charging cryptocurrency in millions and are not ready to entertain

any negotiation of hackers.

As the company failed to pay them the demanded ransom, the cyber crooks
have leaked addresses, passports, and national insurance numbers and are
threatening to leak more sensitive information in the coming weeks, if the

victim cannot pay them the demanded ransom.

Play Ransomware gang is suspected to be behind the incident. But the news

is yet to be confirmed by the sources from the Britain’s biggest car dealers.
Cybersecurity Insiders has learnt from its resources that the threat actors
have so far leaked 15GB of information out of the 467GB that they siphoned

from the servers last month.

On Sunday, they leaked a portion of data onto the dark web that contained

438

Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 45.arnold_clark_data_breach_could_lead_to_identity_theft.pdf

bank statements details and the car registration number associated with the

car owner.

Security analysts state that such information can easily be misused, leading
to frauds and identity thefts where criminals pose as a person and commit

frauds without the permission of the victim.

NOTE- Play Ransomware aka PlayCrypt is a kind of file encrypting malware
that was first identified in June 2022. Last year, the said group of criminals
hacked into cloud service provider Rackspace, that happens to be the first
renowned victim in their list of targets. According to a research conducted by
Trend Micro, Play has some connection with Quantum Ransomware, a
malware linked to the Conti Ransomware gang that has an established
business of conducting online crime and has a team of research and
development, spammers, negotiators tied up with a legal firm and a call center

to conduct negotiations with representatives of victims.

About the Guide to the GDPR

The Guide to the UK GDPR is part of our Guide to Data Protection. It is for DPOs and others who have
day-to-day responsibility for data protection.

 

It explains the general data protection regime that applies to most UK businesses and organisations. It
covers the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018.

It explains each of the data protection principles, rights and obligations. It summarises the key points you
need to know, answers frequently asked questions, and contains practical checklists to help you comply.

Where relevant, this guide also links to more detailed guidance and other resources, including ICO guidance
and statutory ICO codes of practice. Links to relevant guidance published by the European Data Protection
Board (EDPB) are also included for reference purposes.

You may also find other sections of the Guide to Data Protection useful:

Key definitions

Who does the UK GDPR apply to?

e The UK GDPR applies to ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’.
e A controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
e A processor is responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.

e If you are a processor, the UK GDPR places specific legal obligations on you; for example, you are
required to maintain records of personal data and processing activities. You will have legal liability if you
are responsible for a breach.

@ However, if you are a controller, you are not relieved of your obligations where a processor is involved —
the UK GDPR places further obligations on you to ensure your contracts with processors comply with the
UK GDPR.

e@ The UK GDPR applies to processing carried out by organisations operating within the UK. It also applies
to organisations outside the UK that offer goods or services to individuals in the UK.

e@ The UK GDPR does not apply to certain activities including processing covered by the Law Enforcement
Directive, processing for national security purposes and processing carried out by individuals purely for
personal/household activities.

Controllers and processors

At a glance

e@ Understanding your role in relation to the personal data you are processing is crucial in ensuring
compliance with the UK GDPR and the fair treatment of individuals.

e Your obligations under the UK GDPR will vary depending on whether you are a controller, joint controller
or processor.

e The ICO has the power to take action against controllers and processors under the UK GDPR.
@ Individuals can bring claims for compensation and damages against both controllers and processors.

@ You should take the time to assess, and document, the status of each organisation you work with in
respect of all the personal data and processing activities you carry out.

@ Whether you are a controller or processor depends on a number of issues. The key question is - who
determines the purposes for which the data are processed and the means of processing?

® Organisations that determine the purposes and means of processing will be controllers regardless of how
they are described in any contract about processing services.

Checklists

The following checklists set out indicators as to whether you are a controller, a processor or a joint
controller. The more boxes you tick, the more likely you are to fall within the relevant category.

@ What are ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’?

@ How do you determine whether you are a controller or processor?
@ What does it mean if you are a controller?

@ What does it mean if you are a processor?

@ What does it mean if you are joint controllers?

@ In more detail

What are ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’?

Controllers are the main decision-makers — they exercise overall control over the purposes and means of
the processing of personal data.

If two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing of the same personal
data, they are joint controllers. However, they are not joint controllers if they are processing the same data
for different purposes.

Processors act on behalf of, and only on the instructions of, the relevant controller.

How do you determine whether you are a controller or processor?

You should be able to differentiate between controllers, joint controllers and processors so you understand
which UK GDPR obligations apply to which organisation.

To determine whether you are a controller or processor, you will need to consider your role and
responsibilities in relation to your data processing activities.

If you exercise overall control of the purpose and means of the processing of personal data - ie, you decide
what data to process and why - you are a controller.

If you don’t have any purpose of your own for processing the data and you only act on a client’s
instructions, you are likely to be a processor — even if you make some technical decisions about how you
process the data.

What does it mean if you are a controller?

Controllers shoulder the highest level of compliance responsibility - you must comply with, and
demonstrate compliance with, all the data protection principles as well as the other UK GDPR requirements.
You are also responsible for the compliance of your processor(s).

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and individuals may take action against a controller regarding
a breach of its obligations.

Controllers in the UK must pay the data protection fee, unless they are exempt.

What does it mean if you are a processor?

Processors do not have the same obligations as controllers under the UK GDPR and do not have to pay a
data protection fee. However, if you are a processor, you do have a number of direct obligations of your

452


--- New Page 14 ---
Page number: 14
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

own under the UK GDPR.

Both the ICO and individuals may take action against a processor regarding a breach of those obligations.

What does it mean if you are joint controllers?

Joint controllers must arrange between themselves who will take primary responsibility for complying with
UK GDPR obligations, and in particular transparency obligations and individuals’ rights. They should make
this information available to individuals.

However, all joint controllers remain responsible for compliance with the controller obligations under the
UK GDPR. Both the ICO and individuals may take action against any controller regarding a breach of those
obligations.

What is personal data?

At a glance

e@ Understanding whether you are processing personal data is critical to understanding whether the
UK GDPR applies to your activities.

e Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

@ What identifies an individual could be as simple as a name or a number or could include other identifiers
such as an IP address or a cookie identifier, or other factors.

e If it is possible to identify an individual directly from the information you are processing, then that
information may be personal data.

e@ If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether
the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing
together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify
that individual.

@ Even if an individual is identified or identifiable, directly or indirectly, from the data you are processing,
it is not personal data unless it ‘relates to’ the individual.

e@ When considering whether information ‘relates to’ an individual, you need to take into account a range
of factors, including the content of the information, the purpose or purposes for which you are
processing it and the likely impact or effect of that processing on the individual.

@ It is possible that the same information is personal data for one controller’s purposes but is not personal
data for the purposes of another controller.

@ Information which has had identifiers removed or replaced in order to pseudonymise the data is still
personal data for the purposes of UK GDPR.

@ Information which is truly anonymous is not covered by the UK GDPR.

e If information that seems to relate to a particular individual is inaccurate (ie it is factually incorrect or is
about a different individual), the information is still personal data, as it relates to that individual.

In brief

@ What is personal data?
@ What are identifiers and related factors?
® Can we identify an individual directly from the information we have?

®@ Can we identify an individual indirectly from the information we have (together with other available
information)?

@ What is the meaning of ‘relates to’?
@ What happens when different organisations process the same data for different purposes?

@ In more detail

What is personal data?

454


--- New Page 16 ---
Page number: 16
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

e The UK GDPR applies to the processing of personal data that is:
@ wholly or partly by automated means; or
@ the processing other than by automated means of personal data which forms part of, or is intended
to form part of, a filing system.
@ Personal data only includes information relating to natural persons who:
®@ can be identified or who are identifiable, directly from the information in question; or
@ who can be indirectly identified from that information in combination with other information.
e Personal data may also include special categories of personal data or criminal conviction and offences

data. These are considered to be more sensitive and you may only process them in more limited
circumstances.

e Pseudonymised data can help reduce privacy risks by making it more difficult to identify individuals, but
it is still personal data.

© If personal data can be truly anonymised then the anonymised data is not subject to the UK GDPR. It is
important to understand what personal data is in order to understand if the data has been anonymised.

e@ Information about a deceased person does not constitute personal data and therefore is not subject to
the UK GDPR.

@ Information about companies or public authorities is not personal data.

@ However, information about individuals acting as sole traders, employees, partners and company
directors where they are individually identifiable and the information relates to them as an individual
may constitute personal data.

What are identifiers and related factors?

@ An individual is ‘identified’ or ‘identifiable’ if you can distinguish them from other individuals.

@ A name is perhaps the most common means of identifying someone. However whether any potential
identifier actually identifies an individual depends on the context.

© A combination of identifiers may be needed to identify an individual.
e@ The UK GDPR provides a non-exhaustive list of identifiers, including:
® name;
@ identification number;
@ location data; and

@ an online identifier.

@ ‘Online identifiers’ includes IP addresses and cookie identifiers which may be personal data.

@ Other factors can identify an individual.

Can we identify an individual directly from the information we have?

e If, by looking solely at the information you are processing you can distinguish an individual from other
individuals, that individual will be identified (or identifiable).

@ You don’t have to know someone’s name for them to be directly identifiable, a combination of other
identifiers may be sufficient to identify the individual.

455

Page number: 17
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ If an individual is directly identifiable from the information, this may constitute personal data.

Can we identify an individual indirectly from the information we have (together with other
available information)?

@ It is important to be aware that information you hold may indirectly identify an individual and therefore
could constitute personal data.

e@ Even if you may need additional information to be able to identify someone, they may still be
identifiable.

e That additional information may be information you already hold, or it may be information that you need
to obtain from another source.

e@ In some circumstances there may be a slight hypothetical possibility that someone might be able to
reconstruct the data in such a way that identifies the individual. However, this is not necessarily
sufficient to make the individual identifiable in terms of UK GDPR. You must consider all the factors at
stake.

@ When considering whether individuals can be identified, you may have to assess the means that could
be used by an interested and sufficiently determined person.

@ You have a continuing obligation to consider whether the likelihood of identification has changed over
time (for example as a result of technological developments).

What is the meaning of ‘relates to’?

e@ Information must ‘relate to’ the identifiable individual to be personal data.
@ This means that it does more than simply identifying them — it must concern the individual in some way.
e@ To decide whether or not data relates to an individual, you may need to consider:
@ the content of the data - is it directly about the individual or their activities?;
@ the purpose you will process the data for; and
e@ the results of or effects on the individual from processing the data.
e Data can reference an identifiable individual and not be personal data about that individual, as the
information does not relate to them.

e@ There will be circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether data is personal data. If this
is the case, as a matter of good practice, you should treat the information with care, ensure that you
have a clear reason for processing the data and, in particular, ensure you hold and dispose of it securely.

@ Inaccurate information may still be personal data if it relates to an identifiable individual.

What happens when different organisations process the same data for different purposes?

@ It is possible that although data does not relate to an identifiable individual for one controller, in the
hands of another controller it does.

@ This is particularly the case where, for the purposes of one controller, the identity of the individuals is
irrelevant and the data therefore does not relate to them.

@ However, when used for a different purpose, or in conjunction with additional information available to
another controller, the data does relate to the identifiable individual.

456


--- New Page 18 ---
Page number: 18
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the purpose for which the controller is using the data in
order to decide whether it relates to an individual.

@ You should take care when you make an analysis of this nature.

What are the principles?

Article 5 of the UK GDPR sets out seven key principles which lie at the heart of the general data protection
regime.

Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be:

66

“(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (lawfulness,
fairness and transparency’);

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that
is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be
incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);

(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (‘data minimisation’);

(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);

458

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods
insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the
appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the
rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);

(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).”

Article 5(2) adds that:

“The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1
(accountability’).”

For more detail on each principle, please read the relevant page of this guide.

Why are the principles important?

The principles lie at the heart of the UK GDPR. They are set out right at the start of the legislation, and
inform everything that follows. They don’t give hard and fast rules, but rather embody the spirit of the
general data protection regime - and as such there are very limited exceptions.

Compliance with the spirit of these key principles is therefore a fundamental building block for good data
protection practice. It is also key to your compliance with the detailed provisions of the UK GDPR.

Failure to comply with the principles may leave you open to substantial fines. Article 83(5)(a) states that
infringements of the basic principles for processing personal data are subject to the highest tier of
administrative fines. This could mean a fine of up to £17.5 million, or 4% of your total worldwide annual
turnover, whichever is higher.

Accountability principle

The accountability principle requires you to take responsibility for what you do with personal data and how
you comply with the other principles.

You must have appropriate measures and records in place to be able to demonstrate your compliance.

For more information, see the accountability and governance section of this guide.

Integrity and confidentiality (security)

You must ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect the personal data you
hold.

This is the ‘integrity and confidentiality’ principle of the GDPR - also known as the security principle.

What is the storage limitation principle?

Article 5(1)(e) says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods
insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation
in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’)”

So, even if you collect and use personal data fairly and lawfully, you cannot keep it for longer than you
actually need it.

There are close links here with the data minimisation and accuracy principles.

The UK GDPR does not set specific time limits for different types of data. This is up to you, and will depend
on how long you need the data for your specified purposes.

Why is storage limitation important?

Ensuring that you erase or anonymise personal data when you no longer need it will reduce the risk that it
becomes irrelevant, excessive, inaccurate or out of date. Apart from helping you to comply with the data
minimisation and accuracy principles, this also reduces the risk that you will use such data in error — to the
detriment of all concerned.

Personal data held for too long will, by definition, be unnecessary. You are unlikely to have a lawful basis for
retention.

From a more practical perspective, it is inefficient to hold more personal data than you need, and there

464


--- New Page 26 ---
Page number: 26
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

may be unnecessary costs associated with storage and security.

Remember that you must also respond to subject access requests for any personal data you hold. This may
be more difficult if you are holding old data for longer than you need.

Good practice around storage limitation - with clear policies on retention periods and erasure - is also likely
to reduce the burden of dealing with queries about retention and individual requests for erasure.

Do we need a retention policy?

Retention policies or retention schedules list the types of record or information you hold, what you use it
for, and how long you intend to keep it. They help you establish and document standard retention periods
for different categories of personal data.

A retention schedule may form part of a broader ‘information asset register’ (IAR), or your general
processing documentation.

To comply with documentation requirements, you need to establish and document standard retention
periods for different categories of information you hold wherever possible. It is also advisable to have a
system for ensuring that your organisation keeps to these retention periods in practice, and for reviewing
retention at appropriate intervals. Your policy must also be flexible enough to allow for early deletion if
appropriate. For example, if you are not actually using a record, you should reconsider whether you need to
retain it.

 

If you are a small organisation undertaking occasional low-risk processing, you may not need a
documented retention policy.

However, if you don’t have a retention policy (or if it doesn’t cover all of the personal data you hold), you
must still regularly review the data you hold, and delete or anonymise anything you no longer need.

The National Archives (TNA) @ publishes practical guidance for public authorities on a range of records
management topics, including retention and disposal. This guidance can help you comply with the
storage limitation principle (even if you are not a public authority):

 

FOI Records Management Code - Guide 8: Disposal of records @

 

The Keeper of the Records of Scotland @ also publishes guidance on Scottish public authorities’ records
management obligations, including specific guidance on retention schedules @.

 

 

How should we set retention periods?

The UK GDPR does not dictate how long you should keep personal data. It is up to you to justify this, based
on your purposes for processing. You are in the best position to judge how long you need it.

You must also be able to justify why you need to keep personal data in a form that permits identification of

465


--- New Page 27 ---
Page number: 27
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

individuals. If you do not need to identify individuals, you should anonymise the data so that identification
is no longer possible.

For example:

e You should consider your stated purposes for processing the personal data. You can keep it as long as
one of those purposes still applies, but you should not keep data indefinitely ‘just in case’, or if there is
only a small possibility that you will use it.

Example

A bank holds personal data about its customers. This includes details of each customer’s address, date
of birth and mother’s maiden name. The bank uses this information as part of its security procedures.
It is appropriate for the bank to retain this data for as long as the customer has an account with the
bank. Even after the account has been closed, the bank may need to continue holding some of this
information for legal or operational reasons for a further set time.

Example

A bank may need to retain images from a CCTV system installed to prevent fraud at an ATM machine
for several weeks, since a suspicious transaction may not come to light until the victim gets their bank
statement. In contrast, a pub may only need to retain images from their CCTV system for a short
period because incidents will come to light very quickly. However, if a crime is reported to the police,
the pub will need to retain images until the police have time to collect them.

Example

A tracing agency holds personal data about a debtor so that it can find that individual on behalf of a
creditor. Once it has found the individual and reported to the creditor, there may be no need to retain
the information about the debtor - the agency should remove it from their systems unless there are
good reasons for keeping it. For example, if the agency has also been asked to collect the debt on
behalf of the creditor.

@ You should consider whether you need to keep a record of a relationship with the individual once that
relationship ends. You may not need to delete all personal data when the relationship ends. You may
need to keep some information so that you can confirm that the relationship existed — and that it has
ended - as well as some of its details.

466

Page number: 28
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

A business may need to keep some personal data about a previous customer so that they can deal with
any complaints the customer might make about the services they provided.

Example

An employer should review the personal data it holds about an employee when they leave the
organisation’s employment. It will need to retain enough data to enable the organisation to deal with,
for example, providing references or pension arrangements. However, it should delete personal data
that it is unlikely to need again from its records — such as the employee’s emergency contact details,
previous addresses, or death-in-service beneficiary details.

Example

A business receives a notice from a former customer requiring it to stop processing the customer’s
personal data for direct marketing. It is appropriate for the business to retain enough information about
the former customer for it to stop including that person in future direct marketing activities.

@ You should consider whether you need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims.
However, you could still delete information that could not possibly be relevant to such a claim. Unless
there is some other reason for keeping it, personal data should be deleted when such a claim could no
longer arise.

Example

An employer receives several applications for a job vacancy. Unless there is a clear business reason for
doing so, the employer should not keep recruitment records for unsuccessful applicants beyond the
statutory period in which a claim arising from the recruitment process may be brought.

e You should consider any legal or regulatory requirements. There are various legal requirements and
professional guidelines about keeping certain kinds of records — such as information needed for income
tax and audit purposes, or information on aspects of health and safety. If you keep personal data to
comply with a requirement like this, you will not be considered to have kept the information for longer

467


--- New Page 29 ---
Page number: 29
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

than necessary.

@ You should consider any relevant industry standards or guidelines. For example, credit reference
agencies keep consumer credit data for six years. Industry guidelines are a good starting point for
standard retention periods and are likely to take a considered approach. However, they do not guarantee
compliance. You must still be able to explain why those periods are justified, and keep them under
review.

You must remember to take a proportionate approach, balancing your needs with the impact of retention
on individuals’ privacy. Don’t forget that your retention of the data must also always be fair and lawful.

When should we review our retention?

You should review whether you still need personal data at the end of any standard retention period, and
erase or anonymise it unless there is a clear justification for keeping it for longer. Automated systems can
flag records for review, or delete information after a pre-determined period. This is particularly useful if you
hold many records of the same type.

It is also good practice to review your retention of personal data at regular intervals before this, especially
if the standard retention period is lengthy or there is potential for a significant impact on individuals.

If you don’t have a set retention period for the personal data, you must regularly review whether you still
need it.

However, there is no firm rule about how regular these reviews must be. Your resources may be a relevant
factor here, along with the privacy risk to individuals. The important thing to remember is that you must be
able to justify your retention and how often you review it.

You must also review whether you still need personal data if the individual asks you to. Individuals have the
absolute right to erasure of personal data that you no longer need for your specified purposes.

What should we do with personal data that we no longer need?

You can either erase (delete) it, or anonymise it.

You need to remember that there is a significant difference between permanently deleting personal data,
and taking it offline. If personal data is stored offline, this should reduce its availability and the risk of
misuse or mistake. However, you are still processing personal data. You should only store it offline (rather
than delete it) if you can still justify holding it. You must be prepared to respond to subject access requests
for personal data stored offline, and you must still comply with all the other principles and rights.

The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and we recognise it is not
always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. The key issue is to ensure you put the data beyond
use. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, you should also delete it from any
back-up of the information on that system.

Further reading

We produced detailed guidance on the issues surrounding deletion under the 1998 Act. This will be
updated for the UK GDPR in due course, but in the meantime still offers useful guidance on the

468


--- New Page 30 ---
Page number: 30
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

practical issues surrounding deletion:

Deleting personal data

 

Alternatively, you can anonymise the data so that it is no longer “in a form which permits identification of
data subjects”.

Personal data that has been pseudonymised — eg key-coded - will usually still permit identification.
Pseudonymisation can be a useful tool for compliance with other principles such as data minimisation and
security, but the storage limitation principle still applies.

How long can we keep personal data for archiving, research or statistical purposes?

You can keep personal data indefinitely if you are holding it only for:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;
e scientific or historical research purposes; or

e statistical purposes.

Although the general rule is that you cannot hold personal data indefinitely ‘just in case’ it might be useful
in future, there is an inbuilt exception if you are keeping it for these archiving, research or statistical
purposes.

You must have appropriate safeguards in place to protect individuals. For example, pseudonymisation may
be appropriate in some cases.

This must be your only purpose. If you justify indefinite retention on this basis, you cannot later use that
data for another purpose - in particular for any decisions affecting particular individuals. This does not
prevent other organisations from accessing public archives, but they must ensure their own collection and
use of the personal data complies with the principles.

How does this apply to data sharing?

If you share personal data with other organisations, you should agree between you what happens once you
no longer need to share the data. In some cases, it may be best to return the shared data to the
organisation that supplied it without keeping a copy. In other cases, all of the organisations involved should
delete their copies of the personal data.

469

Example

Personal data about the customers of Company A is shared with Company B, which is negotiating to
buy Company A’s business. The companies arrange for Company B to keep the information confidential,
and use it only in connection with the proposed transaction. The sale does not go ahead and Company
B returns the customer information to Company A without keeping a copy.

The organisations involved in an information-sharing initiative may each need to set their own retention
periods, because some may have good reasons to retain personal data for longer than others. However, if
you all only hold the data for the purposes of the data-sharing initiative and it is no longer needed for that
initiative, then all organisations with copies of the information should delete it.

What is the accuracy principle?

Article 5(1)(d) of the UK GDPR says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’)”

This is the second of three principles about data standards, along with data minimisation and storage
limitation.

personal data corrected.
In practice, this means that you must:

@ take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of any personal data;
® ensure that the source and status of personal data is clear;
@ carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of information; and

® consider whether it is necessary to periodically update the information.

When is personal data ‘accurate’ or ‘inaccurate’?

The UK GDPR does not define the word ‘accurate’. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 does say that
‘inaccurate’ means “incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact”. It will usually be obvious whether
personal data is accurate.

You must always be clear about what you intend the record of the personal data to show. What you use it
for may affect whether it is accurate or not. For example, just because personal data has changed doesn’t
mean that a historical record is inaccurate - but you must be clear that it is a historical record.

472

Page number: 34
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

If an individual moves house from London to Manchester a record saying that they currently live in
London will obviously be inaccurate. However a record saying that the individual once lived in London
remains accurate, even though they no longer live there.

Example

The Postcode Address File (PAF) contains UK property postal addresses. It is structured to reflect the
way the Royal Mail delivers post. So it is common for someone to have a postal address linked to a
town in one county (eg Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire) even if they actually live in another county (eg
Cheshire) and pay council tax to that council. The PAF file is not intended to accurately reflect county
boundaries.

What about records of mistakes?

There is often confusion about whether it is appropriate to keep records of things that happened which
should not have happened. Individuals understandably do not want their records to be tarnished by, for
example, a penalty or other charge that was later cancelled or refunded.

However, you may legitimately need your records to accurately reflect the order of events — in this
example, that a charge was imposed, but later cancelled or refunded. Keeping a record of the mistake and
its correction might also be in the individual’s best interests.

Example

A misdiagnosis of a medical condition continues to be held as part of a patient’s medical records even
after the diagnosis is corrected, because it is relevant for the purpose of explaining treatment given to
the patient, or for other health problems.

It is acceptable to keep records of mistakes, provided those records are not misleading about the facts. You
may need to add a note to make clear that a mistake was made.

Example

473


--- New Page 35 ---
Page number: 35
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

An individual finds that, because of an error, their account with their existing energy supplier has been
closed and an account opened with a new supplier. Understandably aggrieved, they believe the original
account should be reinstated and no record kept of the unauthorised transfer. Although this reaction is
understandable, if their existing supplier did close their account, and another supplier opened a new
account, then records reflecting what actually happened will be accurate. In such cases it makes sense
to ensure that the record clearly shows that an error occurred.

Example

An individual is dismissed for alleged misconduct. An Employment Tribunal finds that the dismissal was
unfair and the individual is reinstated. The individual demands that the employer deletes all references
to misconduct. However, the record of the dismissal is accurate. The Tribunal’s decision was that the
employee should not have been dismissed on those grounds. The employer should ensure its records
reflect this.

What about accuracy of opinions?

A record of an opinion is not necessarily inaccurate personal data just because the individual disagrees with
it, or it is later proved to be wrong. Opinions are, by their very nature, subjective and not intended to
record matters of fact.

However, in order to be accurate, your records must make clear that it is an opinion, and, where
appropriate, whose opinion it is. If it becomes clear that an opinion was based on inaccurate data, you
should also record this fact in order to ensure your records are not misleading.

Example

An area of particular sensitivity is medical opinion, where doctors routinely record their opinions about
possible diagnoses. It is often impossible to conclude with certainty, perhaps until time has passed or
tests have been done, whether a patient is suffering from a particular condition. An initial diagnosis
(which is an informed opinion) may prove to be incorrect after more extensive examination or further
tests. However, if the patient’s records reflect the doctor’s diagnosis at the time, the records are not
inaccurate, because they accurately reflect that doctor’s opinion at a particular time. Moreover, the
record of the doctor’s initial diagnosis may help those treating the patient later, and in data protection
terms is required in order to comply with the ‘adequacy’ element of the data minimisation principle.

If an individual challenges the accuracy of an opinion, it is good practice to add a note recording the
challenge and the reasons behind it.

How much weight is actually placed on an opinion is likely to depend on the experience and reliability of the

474


--- New Page 36 ---
Page number: 36
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

person whose opinion it is, and what they base their opinion on. An opinion formed during a brief meeting
will probably be given less weight than one derived from considerable dealings with the individual.
However, this is not really an issue of accuracy. Instead, you need to consider whether the personal data is
“adequate” for your purposes, in line with the data minimisation principle.

Note that some records that may appear to be opinions do not contain an opinion at all. For example, many
financial institutions use credit scores to help them decide whether to provide credit. A credit score is a
number that summarises the historical credit information on a credit report and provides a numerical
predictor of the risk involved in granting an individual credit. Credit scores are based on a statistical
analysis of individuals’ personal data, rather than on a subjective opinion about their creditworthiness.
However, you must ensure the accuracy (and adequacy) of the underlying data.

Does personal data always have to be up to date?

This depends on what you use the information for. If you use the information for a purpose that relies on it
remaining current, you should keep it up to date. For example, you should update your employee payroll
records when there is a pay rise. Similarly, you should update your records for customers’ changes of
address so that goods are delivered to the correct location.

In other cases, it will be equally obvious that you do not need to update information.

Example

An individual places a one-off order with an organisation. The organisation will probably have good
reason to retain a record of the order for a certain period for accounting reasons and because of
possible complaints. However, this does not mean that it has to regularly check that the customer is
still living at the same address.

You do not need to update personal data if this would defeat the purpose of the processing. For example, if
you hold personal data only for statistical, historical or other research reasons, updating the data might
defeat that purpose.

In some cases it is reasonable to rely on the individual to tell you when their personal data has changed,
such as when they change address or other contact details. It may be sensible to periodically ask
individuals to update their own details, but you do not need to take extreme measures to ensure your
records are up to date, unless there is a corresponding privacy risk which justifies this.

475


--- New Page 37 ---
Page number: 37
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

An organisation keeps addresses and contact details of previous customers for marketing purposes. It
does not have to use data matching or tracing services to ensure its records are up to date - and it
may actually be difficult to show that the processing involved in data matching or tracing for these
purposes is fair, lawful and transparent.

However, if an individual informs the organisation of a new address, it should update its records. And if a
mailing is returned with the message ‘not at this address’ marked on the envelope — or any other
information comes to light which suggests the address is no longer accurate — the organisation should
update its records to indicate that the address is no longer current.

What steps do we need to take to ensure accuracy?

Where you use your own resources to compile personal data about an individual, then you must make sure
the information is correct. You should take particular care if the information could have serious implications
for the individual. If, for example, you give an employee a pay increase on the basis of an annual increment
and a performance bonus, then there is no excuse for getting the new salary figure wrong in your payroll
records.

We recognise that it may be impractical to check the accuracy of personal data someone else provides. In
order to ensure that your records are not inaccurate or misleading in this case, you must:

@ accurately record the information provided;
® accurately record the source of the information;
@ take reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure the accuracy of the information; and

@ carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of the information.

What is a ‘reasonable step’ will depend on the circumstances and, in particular, the nature of the personal
data and what you will use it for. The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater
the effort you should put into ensuring its accuracy. So if you are using the data to make decisions that
may significantly affect the individual concerned or others, you need to put more effort into ensuring
accuracy. This may mean you have to get independent confirmation that the data is accurate. For example,
employers may need to check the precise details of job applicants’ education, qualifications and work
experience if it is essential for that particular role, when they would need to obtain authoritative
verification.

Example

An organisation recruiting a driver will want proof that the individuals they interview are entitled to
drive the type of vehicle involved. The fact that an applicant states in his work history that he worked

476


--- New Page 38 ---

as a Father Christmas in a department store 20 years ago does not need to be checked for this
particular job.

If your information source is someone you know to be reliable, or is a well-known organisation, it is usually
reasonable to assume that they have given you accurate information. However, in some circumstances you
need to double-check - for example if inaccurate information could have serious consequences, or if
common sense suggests there may be a mistake.

Example

A business that is closing down recommends a member of staff to another organisation. Assuming the
two employers know each other, it may be reasonable for the organisation to which the
recommendation is made to accept assurances about the individual’s work experience at face value.
However, if a particular skill or qualification is needed for the new job role, the organisation needs to
make appropriate checks.

Example

An individual sends an email to her mobile phone company requesting that it changes its records about
her willingness to receive marketing material. The company amends its records accordingly without
making any checks. However, when the customer emails again asking the company to send her bills to
a new address, they carry out additional security checks before making the requested change.

Even if you originally took all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of the data, if you later get any new
information which suggests it may be wrong or misleading, you should reconsider whether it is accurate
and take steps to erase, update or correct it in light of that new information as soon as possible.

What should we do if an individual challenges the accuracy of their personal data?

If this happens, you should consider whether the information is accurate and, if it is not, you should delete
or correct it.

Remember that individuals have the absolute right to have incorrect personal data rectified - see the right
to rectification for more information.

Individuals don’t have the right to erasure just because data is inaccurate. However, the accuracy principle
requires you to take all reasonable steps to erase or rectify inaccurate data without delay, and it may be
reasonable to erase the data in some cases. If an individual asks you to delete inaccurate data it is
therefore good practice to consider this request.

Data minimisation

At a glance

You must ensure the personal data you are processing is:

@ adequate -— sufficient to properly fulfil your stated purpose;
e@ relevant — has a rational link to that purpose; and

e limited to what is necessary - you do not hold more than you need for that purpose.

Checklist

Oo We only collect personal data we actually need for our specified purposes.
O We have sufficient personal data to properly fulfil those purposes.

O We periodically review the data we hold, and delete anything we don’t need.

In brief

@ How do we decide what is adequate, relevant and limited?
@ When could we be processing too much personal data?

What is the data minimisation principle?

Article 5(1)(c) says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (data minimisation)”

479


--- New Page 41 ---
Page number: 41
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

So you should identify the minimum amount of personal data you need to fulfil your purpose. You should
hold that much information, but no more.

This is the first of three principles about data standards, along with accuracy and storage limitation.

The accountability principle means that you need to be able to demonstrate that you have appropriate
processes to ensure that you only collect and hold the personal data you need.

Also bear in mind that the UK GDPR says individuals have the right to complete any incomplete data which
is inadequate for your purpose, under the right to rectification. They also have right to get you to delete
any data that is not necessary for your purpose, under the right to erasure (right to be forgotten).

How do we decide what is adequate, relevant and limited?

The UK GDPR does not define these terms. Clearly, though, this will depend on your specified purpose for
collecting and using the personal data. It may also differ from one individual to another.

So, to assess whether you are holding the right amount of personal data, you must first be clear about why
you need it.

For special category data or criminal offence data, it is particularly important to make sure you collect and
retain only the minimum amount of information.

You may need to consider this separately for each individual, or for each group of individuals sharing
relevant characteristics. You should in particular consider any specific factors that an individual brings to
your attention - for example, as part of an objection, request for rectification of incomplete data, or
request for erasure of unnecessary data.

You should periodically review your processing to check that the personal data you hold is still relevant and
adequate for your purposes, and delete anything you no longer need. This is closely linked with the storage
limitation principle.

When could we be processing too much personal data?

You should not have more personal data than you need to achieve your purpose. Nor should the data
include irrelevant details.

Example

A debt collection agency is engaged to find a particular debtor. It collects information on several people
with a similar name to the debtor. During the enquiry some of these people are discounted. The agency
should delete most of their personal data, keeping only the minimum data needed to form a basic
record of a person they have removed from their search. It is appropriate to keep this small amount of
information so that these people are not contacted again about debts which do not belong to them.

If you need to process particular information about certain individuals only, you should collect it just for

480


--- New Page 42 ---
Page number: 42
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

those individuals — the information is likely to be excessive and irrelevant in relation to other people.

Example

A recruitment agency places workers in a variety of jobs. It sends applicants a general questionnaire,
which includes specific questions about health conditions that are only relevant to particular manual
occupations. It would be irrelevant and excessive to obtain such information from an individual who
was applying for an office job.

You must not collect personal data on the off-chance that it might be useful in the future. However, you
may be able to hold information for a foreseeable event that may never occur if you can justify it.

Example

An employer holds details of the blood groups of some of its employees. These employees do
hazardous work and the information is needed in case of accident. The employer has in place safety
procedures to help prevent accidents so it may be that this data is never needed, but it still needs to
hold this information in case of emergency.

If the employer holds the blood groups of the rest of the workforce, though, such information is likely
to be irrelevant and excessive as they do not engage in the same hazardous work.

If you are holding more data than is actually necessary for your purpose, this is likely to be unlawful (as
most of the lawful bases have a necessity element) as well as a breach of the data minimisation principle.
Individuals will also have the right to erasure.

When could we be processing inadequate personal data?

If the processing you carry out is not helping you to achieve your purpose then the personal data you have
is probably inadequate. You should not process personal data if it is insufficient for its intended purpose.

In some circumstances you may need to collect more personal data than you had originally anticipated
using, so that you have enough information for the purpose in question.

Example

A group of individuals set up a club. At the outset the club has only a handful of members, who all
know each other, and the club’s activities are administered using only basic information about the
members’ names and email addresses. The club proves to be very popular and its membership grows

481


--- New Page 43 ---
Page number: 43
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

rapidly. It becomes necessary to collect additional information about members so that the club can
identify them properly, and so that it can keep track of their membership status, subscription payments
etc.

Data may also be inadequate if you are making decisions about someone based on an incomplete
understanding of the facts. In particular, if an individual asks you to supplement incomplete data under
their right to rectification, this could indicate that the data might be inadequate for your purpose.

Obviously it makes no business sense to have inadequate personal data — but you must be careful not to go
too far the other way and collect more than you need.

What about the adequacy and relevance of opinions?

A record of an opinion is not necessarily inadequate or irrelevant personal data just because the individual
disagrees with it or thinks it has not taken account of information they think is important.

However, in order to be adequate, your records should make clear that it is opinion rather than fact. The
record of the opinion (or of the context it is held in) should also contain enough information to enable a
reader to interpret it correctly. For example, it should state the date and the author’s name and position.

If an opinion is likely to be controversial or very sensitive, or if it will have a significant impact when used
or disclosed, it is even more important to state the circumstances or the evidence it is based on. If a record
contains an opinion that summarises more detailed records held elsewhere, you should make this clear.

Example

A GP's record may hold only a letter from a consultant and it will be the hospital file that contains
greater detail. In this case, the record of the consultant’s opinion should contain enough information to
enable detailed records to be traced.

For more information about the accuracy of opinions, see our guidance on the accuracy principle.

Article 5(1)(b) says:

66

484


--- New Page 46 ---
Page number: 46
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

“1. Personal data shall be:

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that
is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1),
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes.”

In practice, this means that you must:

e@ be clear from the outset why you are collecting personal data and what you intend to do with it;
® comply with your documentation obligations to specify your purposes;
@ comply with your transparency obligations to inform individuals about your purposes; and

@ ensure that if you plan to use or disclose personal data for any purpose that is additional to or different
from the originally specified purpose, the new use is fair, lawful and transparent.

Why do we need to specify our purposes?

This requirement aims to ensure that you are clear and open about your reasons for obtaining personal
data, and that what you do with the data is in line with the reasonable expectations of the individuals
concerned.

Specifying your purposes from the outset helps you to be accountable for your processing, and helps you
avoid ‘function creep’. It also helps individuals understand how you use their data, make decisions about
whether they are happy to share their details, and assert their rights over data where appropriate. It is
fundamental to building public trust in how you use personal data.

There are clear links with other principles — in particular, the fairness, lawfulness and transparency
principle. Being clear about why you are processing personal data will help you to ensure your processing is
fair, lawful and transparent. And if you use data for unfair, unlawful or ‘invisible’ reasons, it’s likely to be a
breach of both principles.

Specifying your purposes is necessary to comply with your accountability obligations.

How do we specify our purposes?

If you comply with your documentation and transparency obligations, you are likely to comply with the
requirement to specify your purposes without doing anything more:

e You need to specify your purpose or purposes for processing personal data within the documentation
you are required to keep as part of your records of processing (documentation) obligations under Article
30.

@ You also need to specify your purposes in your privacy information for individuals.

However, you should also remember that whatever you document, and whatever you tell people, this
cannot make fundamentally unfair processing fair and lawful.

485

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you are a small organisation and you are exempt from some documentation requirements, you may not
need to formally document all of your purposes to comply with the purpose limitation principle. Listing your
purposes in the privacy information you provide to individuals will be enough. However, it is still good
practice to document all of your purposes. For more information, read our documentation guidance.

 

If you have not provided privacy information because you are only using personal data for an obvious
purpose that individuals already know about, the “specified purpose” should be taken to be the obvious
purpose.

You should regularly review your processing, documentation and privacy information to check that your
purposes have not evolved over time beyond those you originally specified (‘function creep’).

Once we collect personal data for a specified purpose, can we use it for other purposes?

The UK GDPR does not ban this altogether, but there are restrictions. In essence, if your purposes change
over time or you want to use data for a new purpose which you did not originally anticipate, you can only
go ahead if:

@ the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose;

@ you get the individual’s specific consent for the new purpose; or

® you can point to a clear legal provision requiring or allowing the new processing in the public interest —

for example, a new function for a public authority.

All processing must also be lawful, so you do need a lawful basis. The original basis you used to collect the
data may not always be appropriate for your new use of that data.

If your new purpose is compatible, and your use of the data is necessary for that purpose, you can
generally be confident it will also be lawful. In most cases, the appropriate basis for your new use of the

for more information.

You need to make sure that you update your privacy information to ensure that your processing is
transparent.

What is a ‘compatible’ purpose?

The UK GDPR specifically says that the following purposes should be considered to be compatible purposes:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;
@ scientific or historical research purposes; and

e statistical purposes.

Please read our detailed guidance on the research provisions for more information.

 

Otherwise, you need to do a compatibility assessment to decide whether a new purpose is compatible with
your original purpose. The assessment should take into account:

486


--- New Page 48 ---
Page number: 48
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ any link between your original purpose and the new purpose;

@ the context in which you originally collected the personal data — in particular, your relationship with the
individual and what they would reasonably expect;

e the nature of the personal data - eg is it particularly sensitive;
@ the possible consequences for individuals of the new processing; and

@ whether there are appropriate safeguards - eg encryption or pseudonymisation.
This list is not exhaustive and what you need to look at depends on the particular circumstances.

We consider a compatibility assessment is likely to look at similar factors to a legitimate interests

help you assess compatibility.

As a general rule, if the new purpose is either very different from the original purpose, would be
unexpected, or would have an unjustified impact on the individual, it is likely to be incompatible with your
original purpose. In practice, you are likely to need to ask for specific consent to use or disclose data for
this type of purpose.

Example

A GP discloses his patient list to his wife, who runs a travel agency, so that she can offer special holiday
deals to patients needing recuperation. Disclosing the information for this purpose would be
incompatible with the purposes for which it was obtained.

What is the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle?

Article 5(1) of the UK GDPR says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (lawfulness,
fairness, transparency’)”

There are more detailed provisions on lawfulness and having a ‘lawful basis for processing’ set out in
Articles 6 to 10.

There are more detailed transparency obligations set out in Articles 13 and 14, as part of the ‘right to be
informed’.

The three elements of lawfulness, fairness and transparency overlap, but you must make sure you satisfy
all three. It’s not enough to show your processing is lawful if it is fundamentally unfair to or hidden from
the individuals concerned.

What is lawfulness?

For processing of personal data to be lawful, you need to identify specific grounds for the processing. This is
called a ‘lawful basis’ for processing, and there are six options which depend on your purpose and your
relationship with the individual. There are also specific additional conditions for processing some especially
sensitive types of data. For more information, see the lawful basis section of this guide.

 

If no lawful basis applies then your processing will be unlawful and in breach of this principle.

Lawfulness also means that you don’t do anything with the personal data which is unlawful in a more
general sense. This includes statute and common law obligations, whether criminal or civil. If processing
involves committing a criminal offence, it will obviously be unlawful. However, processing may also be
unlawful if it results in:

@ a breach of a duty of confidence;

® your organisation exceeding its legal powers or exercising those powers improperly;

@ an infringement of copyright;

@ a breach of an enforceable contractual agreement;

@ a breach of industry-specific legislation or regulations; or

@ a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998.

498


--- New Page 52 ---
Page number: 52
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

These are just examples, and this list is not exhaustive. You may need to take your own legal advice on
other relevant legal requirements.

Although processing personal data in breach of copyright or industry regulations (for example) will involve
unlawful processing in breach of this principle, this does not mean that the ICO can pursue allegations
which are primarily about breaches of copyright, financial regulations or other laws outside our remit and
expertise as data protection regulator. In this situation there are likely to be other legal or regulatory routes
of redress where the issues can be considered in a more appropriate forum.

If you have processed personal data unlawfully, the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to erase that data
or restrict your processing of it.

What is fairness?

Processing of personal data must always be fair as well as lawful. If any aspect of your processing is unfair
you will be in breach of this principle - even if you can show that you have a lawful basis for the
processing.

In general, fairness means that you should only handle personal data in ways that people would reasonably
expect and not use it in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on them. You need to stop and think not
just about how you can use personal data, but also about whether you should.

Assessing whether you are processing information fairly depends partly on how you obtain it. In particular,
if anyone is deceived or misled when the personal data is obtained, then this is unlikely to be fair.

In order to assess whether or not you are processing personal data fairly, you must consider more
generally how it affects the interests of the people concerned — as a group and individually. If you have
obtained and used the information fairly in relation to most of the people it relates to but unfairly in relation
to one individual, there will still be a breach of this principle.

Personal data may sometimes be used in a way that negatively affects an individual without this necessarily
being unfair. What matters is whether or not such detriment is justified.

Example

Where personal data is collected to assess tax liability or to impose a fine for breaking the speed limit,
the information is being used in a way that may cause detriment to the individuals concerned, but the
proper use of personal data for these purposes will not be unfair.

You should also ensure that you treat individuals fairly when they seek to exercise their rights over their
data. This ties in with your obligation to facilitate the exercise of individuals’ rights. Read our guidance on
rights for more information.

What is transparency?

Transparency is fundamentally linked to fairness. Transparent processing is about being clear, open and

491


--- New Page 53 ---
Page number: 53
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

honest with people from the start about who you are, and how and why you use their personal data.

Transparency is always important, but especially in situations where individuals have a choice about
whether they wish to enter into a relationship with you. If individuals know at the outset what you will use
their information for, they will be able to make an informed decision about whether to enter into a
relationship, or perhaps to try to renegotiate the terms of that relationship.

Transparency is important even when you have no direct relationship with the individual and collect their
personal data from another source. In some cases, it can be even more important - as individuals may
have no idea that you are collecting and using their personal data, and this affects their ability to assert
their rights over their data. This is sometimes known as ‘invisible processing’.

You must ensure that you tell individuals about your processing in a way that is easily accessible and easy
to understand. You must use clear and plain language.

Lawful basis for processing

At a glance

@ You must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data.

e@ There are six available lawful bases for processing. No single basis is ‘better’ or more important than the
others — which basis is most appropriate to use will depend on your purpose and relationship with the
individual.

e Most lawful bases require that processing is ‘necessary’ for a specific purpose. If you can reasonably
achieve the same purpose without the processing, you won’t have a lawful basis.

e You must determine your lawful basis before you begin processing, and you should document it. We
have an interactive tool to help you.

@ Take care to get it right first time - you should not swap to a different lawful basis at a later date without
good reason. In particular, you cannot usually swap from consent to a different basis.

@ Your privacy notice should include your lawful basis for processing as well as the purposes of the
processing.

e If your purposes change, you need to consider whether you need a new lawful basis.

e If you are processing special category data you need to identify both a lawful basis for general

What are the lawful bases for processing?

The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the UK GDPR. At least one of these must apply
whenever you process personal data:

(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific
purpose.

(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they
have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.

(c) Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual
obligations).

(d) Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone's life.

(e) Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your
official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.

(f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate
interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which
overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to
perform your official tasks.)

For more detail on each lawful basis, read the specific page of this guide.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

When is processing ‘necessary’?

Many of the lawful bases for processing depend on the processing being “necessary”. This does not mean
that processing has to be absolutely essential. However, it must be more than just useful, and more than
just standard practice. It must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving a specific purpose. The
lawful basis will not apply if you can reasonably achieve the purpose by some other less intrusive means, or
by processing less data.

It is not enough to argue that processing is necessary because you have chosen to operate your business in
a particular way. The question is whether the processing is objectively necessary for the stated purpose,
not whether it is a necessary part of your chosen methods.

Why is the lawful basis for processing important?

The first principle requires that you process all personal data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. If
no lawful basis applies to your processing, your processing will be unlawful and in breach of the first
principle.

Individuals also have the right to erase personal data which has been processed unlawfully.

The individual’s right to be informed under Article 13 and 14 requires you to provide people with
information about your lawful basis for processing. This means you need to include these details in your
privacy notice.

The lawful basis for your processing can also affect which rights are available to individuals. For example,
some rights will not apply:

 

Right to Right to Right to
erasure portability object
x
Consent but right to

withdraw consent

Contract x
Legal obligation x x x
Vital interests x x
Public task x x
Legitimate x
Interests

However, an individual always has the right to object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing,
whatever lawful basis applies.

The remaining rights are not always absolute, and there are other rights which may be affected in other
ways. For example, your lawful basis may affect how provisions relating to automated decisions and

495

profiling apply, and if you are relying on legitimate interests you need more detail in your privacy notice.
Please read the section of this Guide on individuals’ rights for full details.

subject) @

How do we decide which lawful basis applies?

This depends on your specific purposes and the context of the processing. You should think about why you
want to process the data, and consider which lawful basis best fits the circumstances. You can use our
interactive guidance tool to help you.

 

You might consider that more than one basis applies, in which case you should identify and document all of
them from the start.

You must not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. No one basis should be seen as always better, safer or
more important than the others, and there is no hierarchy in the order of the list in the UK GDPR.

Several of the lawful bases relate to a particular specified purpose - a legal obligation, performing a
contract with the individual, protecting someone’s vital interests, or performing your public tasks. If you are
processing for these purposes then the appropriate lawful basis may well be obvious, so it is helpful to
consider these first.

In other cases you are likely to have a choice between using legitimate interests or consent. You need to
give some thought to the wider context, including:

@ Who does the processing benefit?

@ Would individuals expect this processing to take place?

@ What is your relationship with the individual?

@ Are you in a position of power over them?

@ What is the impact of the processing on the individual?

@ Are they vulnerable?

e Are some of the individuals concerned likely to object?

e Are you able to stop the processing at any time on request?
You may prefer to consider legitimate interests as your lawful basis if you wish to keep control over the
processing and take responsibility for demonstrating that it is in line with people’s reasonable expectations
and wouldn't have an unwarranted impact on them. On the other hand, if you prefer to give individuals full

control over and responsibility for their data (including the ability to change their mind as to whether it can
continue to be processed), you may want to consider relying on individuals’ consent.

We have produced the lawful basis interactive guidance tool, to give more tailored guidance on which
lawful basis is likely to be most appropriate for your processing activities.

 

Is this different for public authorities?

The basic approach is the same. You should think about your purposes, and choose whichever basis fits

The public task basis is more likely to be relevant to much of what you do. If you are a public authority and
can demonstrate that the processing is to perform your tasks as set down in UK law, then you are able to
use the public task basis. But if it is for another purpose, you can still consider another basis.

In particular, you may still be able to consider consent or legitimate interests in some cases, depending on
the nature of the processing and your relationship with the individual. There is no absolute ban on public
authorities using consent or legitimate interests as their lawful basis, although there are some limitations.
For more information, see the specific guidance page on each lawful basis.

The Data Protection Act 2018 says that ‘public authority’ here means a public authority under the Freedom
of Information Act or Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act - with the exception of parish and community
councils.

Example

A university that wants to process personal data may consider a variety of lawful bases depending on
what it wants to do with the data.

Universities are classified as public authorities, so the public task basis is likely to apply to much of
their processing, depending on the detail of their constitutions and legal powers. If the processing is
separate from their tasks as a public authority, then the university may instead wish to consider
whether consent or legitimate interests are appropriate in the particular circumstances. For example, a
University might rely on public task for processing personal data for teaching and research purposes;
but a mixture of legitimate interests and consent for alumni relations and fundraising purposes.

The university however needs to consider its basis carefully —- it is the controller’s responsibility to be
able to demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the particular processing purpose.

You must determine your lawful basis before starting to process personal data. It’s important to get this
right first time. If you find at a later date that your chosen basis was actually inappropriate, it will be
difficult to simply swap to a different one. Even if a different basis could have applied from the start,
retrospectively switching lawful basis is likely to be inherently unfair to the individual and lead to breaches
of accountability and transparency requirements.

Example

A company decided to process on the basis of consent, and obtained consent from individuals. An
individual subsequently decided to withdraw their consent to the processing of their data, as is their
right. However, the company wanted to keep processing the data so decided to continue the processing
on the basis of legitimate interests.

Even if it could have originally relied on legitimate interests, the company cannot do so at a later date -
it cannot switch basis when it realised that the original chosen basis was inappropriate (in this case,
because it did not want to offer the individual genuine ongoing control). It should have made clear to
the individual from the start that it was processing on the basis of legitimate interests. Leading the
individual to believe they had a choice is inherently unfair if that choice will be irrelevant. The company
must therefore stop processing when the individual withdraws consent.

It is therefore important to thoroughly assess upfront which basis is appropriate and document this. It may
be possible that more than one basis applies to the processing because you have more than one purpose,
and if this is the case then you should make this clear from the start.

If there is a genuine change in circumstances or you have a new and unanticipated purpose which means
there is a good reason to review your lawful basis and make a change, you need to inform the individual
and document the change.

What happens if we have a new purpose?

If your purposes change over time or you have a new purpose which you did not originally anticipate, you
need to comply with the purpose limitation principle. In summary, you can only go ahead if:

@ the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose;

@ you get the individual’s specific consent for the new purpose; or

® you can point to a clear legal provision requiring or allowing the new processing in the public interest —

for example, a new function for a public authority.

For more information on compatibility, see our purpose limitation guidance.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

All processing must be lawful, so you also need to identify a lawful basis. The original basis you used to
collect the data may not always be appropriate for your new use of the data.

In most cases, the appropriate basis for your new use of the data is likely to be fairly obvious. For example,
if you are getting specific consent for the new purpose, your lawful basis will be consent. If you are relying
on a legal provision requiring the new processing in the public interest, your lawful basis will be legal
obligation. If you are relying on a legal provision allowing the new use of data in the public interest, your
lawful basis will be public task.

Where the purpose for your new processing activity is compatible with the original purpose for the
processing, you are likely to be able to rely on “legitimate interests” as the lawful basis for the new
processing, provided your use of the personal data is necessary for that purpose.

We consider a compatibility assessment is likely to look at similar factors to a legitimate interests

help you assess compatibility.This will also help demonstrate your lawful basis at the same time.

If your new processing is for research purposes, you do not need to carry out a compatibility assessment,
and in most circumstances you can be confident that your lawful basis is likely to be either public task or

However, if you originally collected the data on the basis of consent, you should get fresh consent which
specifically covers the new purpose (unless you are relying on a clear legal provision specifically permitting
your reuse of the data). This is because consent means giving individuals real choice and control over how
their data is used. This means that consent must always be specific and informed. People can only give
valid consent when they know and understand what you are going to do with their data. If you do get
specific consent for the new purpose, you do not need to show it is compatible.

If you are processing special category data, you will also need to ensure that you can identify an
appropriate condition which applies to your new processing.

How should we document our lawful basis?

The principle of accountability requires you to be able to demonstrate that you are complying with the

UK GDPR, and have appropriate policies and processes. This means that you need to be able to show that
you have properly considered which lawful basis applies to each processing purpose and can justify your
decision.

You need therefore to keep a record of which basis you are relying on for each processing purpose, and a
justification for why you believe it applies. There is no standard form for this, as long as you ensure that
what you record is sufficient to demonstrate that a lawful basis applies. This will help you comply with
accountability obligations, and will also help you when writing your privacy notices.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you can demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the particular

What do we need to tell people?

You need to include information about your lawful basis (or bases, if more than one applies) in your privacy
notice. Under the transparency provisions of the UK GDPR, the information you need to give people
includes:

@ your intended purposes for processing the personal data; and

e the lawful basis for the processing.

This applies whether you collect the personal data directly from the individual or you collect their data from
another source.

What about special category data?

If you are processing special category data, you need to identify both a lawful basis for processing and a
special category condition for processing in compliance with Article 9. You should document both your
lawful basis for processing and your special category condition so that you can demonstrate compliance and
accountability.

What about criminal offence data?

If you are processing data about criminal convictions, criminal offences or related security measures, you
need both a lawful basis for processing, and either ‘official authority’ or a separate condition for processing
this data in compliance with Article 10. You should document both your lawful basis for processing and your
criminal offence data condition so that you can demonstrate compliance and accountability.

Criminal offence data

At a glance

@ The UK GDPR gives extra protection to the personal data of offenders or suspected offenders in the
context of criminal activity, allegations, investigations, and proceedings.

e If you have official authority, you can process personal data about criminal convictions and offences,
because you are processing the data in an official capacity.

@ If you do not have official authority, you can only process criminal offence data if you can identify a
specific condition for processing in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.

@ You cannot keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions, unless you do so in an official
capacity.

@ You must determine your condition for processing criminal offence data, or identify your official authority
for the processing, before you begin the processing, and you should document this.

e You must still have a lawful basis for your processing under Article 6.

@ In many cases, you also need an ‘appropriate policy document @” in place in order to meet a UK
Schedule 1 condition for processing in the DPA 2018.

® You need to complete a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for any type of processing which is
likely to be high risk. You must therefore be aware of the risks of processing the criminal offence data.

@ In more detail

What is criminal offence data?

The UK GDPR gives extra protection to “personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or
related security measures”. We refer to this as criminal offence data.

This covers a wide range of information about offenders or suspected offenders in the context of:

® criminal activity;

@ allegations;

@ investigations; and
® proceedings.

It includes not just data which is obviously about a specific criminal conviction or trial, but may also include
personal data about:

503


--- New Page 65 ---
Page number: 65
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® unproven allegations; and

@ e information relating to the absence of convictions.
It also covers a wide range of related security measures, including

® personal data about penalties;

@ conditions or restrictions placed on an individual as part of the criminal justice process; or

e civil measures which may lead to a criminal penalty if not adhered to.

It does not cover information about other individuals, including victims and witnesses of crime. However,

information about victims and witnesses is likely to be sensitive, and controllers should take particular care
when processing it.

What are the rules for criminal offence data?

You must always ensure that your processing is generally lawful, fair and transparent and complies with all
the other principles and requirements of the UK GDPR. To ensure that your processing is lawful, you need
to identify an Article 6 basis for processing.

In addition, you can only process criminal offence data if the processing is either:

®@ under the control of official authority; or

® authorised by domestic law. This means you need to meet one of the conditions in Schedule 1 @ of the
DPA 2018.

You may only keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions if this register is “under the control of
official authority”.

Public bodies, or private bodies who are given public sector tasks, may have “official authority” to process
criminal offence data. This official authority may derive from either common law or statute. If you area
public body, you must identify the specific law that gives you official authority to process criminal offence
data.

If you do not have official authority for the processing, it must be authorised by domestic law. This
authorisation in law is set out in the conditions listed in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018 @.

 

You must also identify whether you need an “appropriate policy document” under the DPA 2018. Our
template appropriate policy document @ shows the kind of information this should contain.

 

You must do a DPIA for any type of processing that is likely to be high risk. This means that you are more
likely to need to do a DPIA for processing criminal offence data. For further information, please see our

You should also consider how the risks associated with criminal offence data affect your other obligations -
in particular, obligations around data minimisation, security, transparency, and DPOs.

In brief

@ What is special category data?

@ What are the rules for special category data?

@ What are the conditions for processing special category data?
@ What are the substantial public interest conditions?

@ In more detail

What is special category data?

The UK GDPR defines special category data as:

® personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;

® personal data revealing political opinions;

@ personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;
® personal data revealing trade union membership;

e genetic data;

e biometric data (where used for identification purposes);

@ data concerning health;

e data concerning a person’s sex life; and

e data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.

This does not include personal data about criminal allegations, proceedings or convictions, as separate rules

Special category data includes personal data revealing or concerning the above types of data. Therefore,
if you have inferred or guessed details about someone which fall into one of the above categories, this data
may count as special category data. It depends on how certain that inference is, and whether you are
deliberately drawing that inference.

What are the rules for special category data?

You must always ensure that your processing is generally lawful, fair and transparent and complies with all
the other principles and requirements of the UK GDPR. To ensure that your processing is lawful, you need
to identify an Article 6 basis for processing.

In addition, you can only process special category data if you can meet one of the specific conditions in
Article 9 of the UK GDPR. You need to consider the purposes of your processing and identify which of these
conditions are relevant.

508

Page number: 70
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Five of the conditions for processing are provided solely in Article 9 of the UK GDPR. The other five require
authorisation or a basis in UK law, which means you need to meet additional conditions set out in the DPA
2018.

You must also identify whether you need an ‘appropriate policy document’ under the DPA 2018. Our
template appropriate policy document @ shows the kind of information this should contain.

 

You must do a DPIA for any type of processing that is likely to be high risk. This means that you are more
likely to need to do a DPIA for processing special category data. For further information, please see our

If you process special category data you must keep records, including documenting the categories of data.
You may also need to consider how the risks associated with special category data affect your other
obligations — in particular, obligations around data minimisation, security, transparency, DPOs and rights
related to automated decision-making.

What are the conditions for processing special category data?

Article 9 lists the conditions for processing special category data:

(a) Explicit consent

(b) Employment, social security and social protection (if authorised by law)
(c) Vital interests

(d) Not-for-profit bodies

(e) Made public by the data subject

(f) Legal claims or judicial acts

(g) Reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law)

(h) Health or social care (with a basis in law)

(i) Public health (with a basis in law)

(j) Archiving, research and statistics (with a basis in law)

If you are relying on conditions (b), (h), (i) or (j), you also need to meet the associated condition in UK
law, set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018 CG.

 

If you are relying on the substantial public interest condition in Article 9(2)(g), you also need to meet one
of 23 specific substantial public interest conditions set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.

What are the substantial public interest conditions?

The 23 substantial public interest conditions are set out in paragraphs 6 to 28 of Schedule 1 of the DPA
2018:

6. Statutory and government purposes

7. Administration of justice and parliamentary purposes
8. Equality of opportunity or treatment

9. Racial and ethnic diversity at senior levels

10. Preventing or detecting unlawful acts

11. Protecting the public

12. Regulatory requirements

26. Publication of legal judgments

27. Anti-doping in sport

28. Standards of behaviour in sport

You should identify which of these conditions appears to most closely reflect your purpose. Our detailed
guidance gives you some further advice on how the conditions generally work, but you always need to refer
to the detailed provisions of each condition @ in the legislation itself to make sure you can demonstrate it
applies.

 

For some of these conditions, the substantial public interest element is built in. For others, you need to be
able to demonstrate that your specific processing is “necessary for reasons of substantial public interest”,
on a case-by-case basis.

The public interest covers a wide range of values and principles relating to the public good, or what is in the
best interests of society. It needs to be real and of substance. Given the inherent risks of special category
data, it is not enough to make a vague or generic public interest argument. You should be able to make
specific arguments about the concrete wider benefits of your processing.

For some of the conditions, you also need to justify why you cannot give individuals a choice and get
explicit consent for your processing. In most cases, you must have an ‘appropriate policy document @” in
place.

Legitimate interests

At a glance

e Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always
be the most appropriate.

e It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect
and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.

e@ If you choose to rely on legitimate interests, you are taking on extra responsibility for considering and
protecting people’s rights and interests.

e@ Public authorities can only rely on legitimate interests if they are processing for a legitimate reason
other than performing their tasks as a public authority.

e There are three elements to the legitimate interests basis. It helps to think of this as a three-part test.
You need to:

@ identify a legitimate interest;
e show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and
@ balance it against the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms.
e The legitimate interests can be your own interests or the interests of third parties. They can include
commercial interests, individual interests or broader societal benefits.

e The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably achieve the same result in another less
intrusive way, legitimate interests will not apply.

e@ You must balance your interests against the individual’s. If they would not reasonably expect the
processing, or if it would cause unjustified harm, their interests are likely to override your legitimate
interests.

@ Keep a record of your legitimate interests assessment (LIA) to help you demonstrate compliance if
required.

@ You must include details of your legitimate interests in your privacy information.

Checklists

In brief

@ What is the ‘legitimate interests' basis?

@ When can we rely on legitimate interests?

@ How can we apply legitimate interests in practice?
@ What else do we need to consider?

e@ In detail

What is the ‘legitimate interests’ basis?

Article 6(1)(f) gives you a lawful basis for processing where:

“processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
third party except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data
subject is a child.”

This can be broken down into a three-part test:

1. Purpose test: are you pursuing a legitimate interest?

2. Necessity test: is the processing necessary for that purpose?

3. Balancing test: do the individual’s interests override the legitimate interest?

A wide range of interests may be legitimate interests. They can be your own interests or the interests of
third parties, and commercial interests as well as wider societal benefits. They may be compelling or trivial,
but trivial interests may be more easily overridden in the balancing test.

The UK GDPR specifically mentions use of client or employee data, marketing, fraud prevention, intra-group
transfers, or IT security as potential legitimate interests, but this is not an exhaustive list. It also says that
you have a legitimate interest in disclosing information about possible criminal acts or security threats to
the authorities.

‘Necessary’ means that the processing must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving your
purpose. You cannot rely on legitimate interests if there is another reasonable and less intrusive way to
achieve the same result.

You must balance your interests against the individual’s interests. In particular, if they would not reasonably
expect you to use data in that way, or it would cause them unwarranted harm, their interests are likely to
override yours. However, your interests do not always have to align with the individual’s interests. If there
is a conflict, your interests can still prevail as long as there is a clear justification for the impact on the
individual.

When can we rely on legitimate interests?

Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis, but you cannot assume it will always be appropriate
for all of your processing.

If you choose to rely on legitimate interests, you take on extra responsibility for ensuring people’s rights
and interests are fully considered and protected.

Legitimate interests is most likely to be an appropriate basis where you use data in ways that people would
reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact. Where there is an impact on individuals, it may
still apply if you can show there is an even more compelling benefit to the processing and the impact is
justified.

You can rely on legitimate interests for marketing activities if you can show that how you use people’s data
is proportionate, has a minimal privacy impact, and people would not be surprised or likely to object - but

electronic marketing.

You can consider legitimate interests for processing children’s data, but you must take extra care to make
sure their interests are protected. See our detailed guidance on children and the UK GDPR.

 

You may be able to rely on legitimate interests in order to lawfully disclose personal data to a third party.
You should consider why they want the information, whether they actually need it, and what they will do
with it. You need to demonstrate that the disclosure is justified, but it will be their responsibility to
determine their lawful basis for their own processing.

You should avoid using legitimate interests if you are using personal data in ways people do not understand
and would not reasonably expect, or if you think some people would object if you explained it to them. You

514

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

should also avoid this basis for processing that could cause harm, unless you are confident there is
nevertheless a compelling reason to go ahead which justifies the impact.

If you are a public authority, you cannot rely on legitimate interests for any processing you do to perform
your tasks as a public authority. However, if you have other legitimate purposes outside the scope of your
tasks as a public authority, you can consider legitimate interests where appropriate. This will be particularly
relevant for public authorities with commercial interests.

See our guidance page on the lawful basis for more information on the alternatives to legitimate interests,
and how to decide which basis to choose.

 

How can we apply legitimate interests in practice?

If you want to rely on legitimate interests, you can use the three-part test to assess whether it applies. We
refer to this as a legitimate interests assessment (LIA) and you should do it before you start the
processing.

An LIA is a type of light-touch risk assessment based on the specific context and circumstances. It will help
you ensure that your processing is lawful. Recording your LIA will also help you demonstrate compliance in
line with your accountability obligations under Articles 5(2) and 24. In some cases an LIA will be quite
short, but in others there will be more to consider.

First, identify the legitimate interest(s). Consider:

@ Why do you want to process the data - what are you trying to achieve?
@ Who benefits from the processing? In what way?

e Are there any wider public benefits to the processing?

@ How important are those benefits?

@ What would the impact be if you couldn’t go ahead?

@ Would your use of the data be unethical or unlawful in any way?
Second, apply the necessity test. Consider:

® Does this processing actually help to further that interest?

@ Is it a reasonable way to go about it?

e@ Is there another less intrusive way to achieve the same result?
Third, do a balancing test. Consider the impact of your processing and whether this overrides the interest
you have identified. You might find it helpful to think about the following:

@ What is the nature of your relationship with the individual?

@ Is any of the data particularly sensitive or private?

@ Would people expect you to use their data in this way?

@ Are you happy to explain it to them?

@ Are some people likely to object or find it intrusive?

@ What is the possible impact on the individual?

515


--- New Page 77 ---
Page number: 77
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ How big an impact might it have on them?

e Are you processing children’s data?

@ Are any of the individuals vulnerable in any other way?
@ Can you adopt any safeguards to minimise the impact?

® Can you offer an opt-out?

You then need to make a decision about whether you still think legitimate interests is an appropriate basis.
There’s no foolproof formula for the outcome of the balancing test — but you must be confident that your
legitimate interests are not overridden by the risks you have identified.

Keep a record of your LIA and the outcome. There is no standard format for this, but it’s important to
record your thinking to help show you have proper decision-making processes in place and to justify the
outcome.

Keep your LIA under review and refresh it if there is a significant change in the purpose, nature or context
of the processing.

If you are not sure about the outcome of the balancing test, it may be safer to look for another lawful
basis. Legitimate interests will not often be the most appropriate basis for processing which is unexpected
or high risk.

If your LIA identifies significant risks, consider whether you need to do a DPIA to assess the risk and

What else do we need to consider?

You must tell people in your privacy information that you are relying on legitimate interests, and explain
what these interests are.

If you want to process the personal data for a new purpose, you may be able to continue processing under
legitimate interests as long as your new purpose is compatible with your original purpose. We would still
recommend that you conduct a new LIA, as this will help you demonstrate compatibility.

If you rely on legitimate interests, the right to data portability does not apply.

If you are relying on legitimate interests for direct marketing, the right to object is absolute and you must
stop processing when someone objects. For other purposes, you must stop unless you can show that your
legitimate interests are compelling enough to override the individual’s rights. See our guidance on
individual rights for more on this.

Our legitimate interests assessment (LIA) template @ is designed to help you to decide whether or not the
legitimate interests basis is likely to apply to your processing.

We have produced the lawful basis interactive guidance tool, to give tailored guidance on which lawful
basis is likely to be most appropriate for your processing activities.

 

In more detail - European Data Protection Board

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party (WP29),
includes representatives from the data protection authorities of each EU member state. It adopts
guidelines for complying with the requirements of the UK GDPR. EDPB guidelines will no longer be
directly relevant to the UK regime and will not be binding under the UK regime. However, they may still
provide helpful guidance on certain issues.

Opinion 06/2014 (9 April 2014) gives detailed guidance on the key elements of the similar legitimate
interests provisions under the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.

Public task

At a glance

@ You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process personal data:

@ ‘in the exercise of official authority’. This covers public functions and powers that are set out in law;
or

@ to perform a specific task in the public interest that is set out in law.
e It is most relevant to public authorities, but it can apply to any organisation that exercises official
authority or carries out tasks in the public interest.

e You do not need a specific statutory power to process personal data, but your underlying task, function
or power must have a clear basis in law.

e The processing must be necessary. If you could reasonably perform your tasks or exercise your powers
in a less intrusive way, this lawful basis does not apply.

e Document your decision to rely on this basis to help you demonstrate compliance if required. You should
be able to specify the relevant task, function or power, and identify its statutory or common law basis.

In brief

@ What is the ‘public task’ basis?

@ What does ‘laid down by law’ mean?
@ Who can rely on this basis?

@ When can we rely on this basis?

@ What else should we consider?

What is the ‘public task’ basis?

Article 6(1)(e) gives you a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller”

This can apply if you are either:

® carrying out a specific task in the public interest which is laid down by law; or

® exercising official authority (for example, a public body’s tasks, functions, duties or powers) which is laid
down by law.

518


--- New Page 80 ---
Page number: 80
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you can show you are exercising official authority, including use of discretionary powers, there is no
additional public interest test. However, you must be able to demonstrate that the processing is ‘necessary’
for that purpose.

‘Necessary’ means that the processing must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving your
purpose. You do not have a lawful basis for processing if there is another reasonable and less intrusive way
to achieve the same result.

In this guide we use the term ‘public task’ to help describe and label this lawful basis. However, this is not a
term used in the UK GDPR itself. Your focus should be on demonstrating either that you are carrying out a
task in the public interest, or that you are exercising official authority.

In particular, there is no direct link to the concept of ‘public task’ in the Re-use of Public Sector Information
Regulations 2015 (RPSI). There is some overlap, as a public sector body’s core role and functions for RPSI
purposes may be a useful starting point in demonstrating official authority for these purposes. However,

context of RPSI.

What does ‘laid down by law’ mean?

Article 6(3) requires that the relevant task or authority must be laid down by domestic law. This will most
often be a statutory function. However, Recital 41 clarifies that this does not have to be an explicit statutory
provision, as long as the application of the law is clear and foreseeable. This means that it includes clear
common law tasks, functions or powers as well as those set out in statute or statutory guidance.

You do not need specific legal authority for the particular processing activity. The point is that your overall
purpose must be to perform a public interest task or exercise official authority, and that overall task or
authority has a sufficiently clear basis in law.

Who can rely on this basis?

Any controller who is exercising official authority or carrying out a specific task in the public interest. The
focus is on the nature of the function, not the nature of the organisation.

Example

Private water companies are likely to be able to rely on the public task basis even if they do not fall
within the definition of a public authority in the Data Protection Act 2018. This is because they are
considered to be carrying out functions of public administration and they exercise special legal powers
to carry out utility services in the public interest. See our guidance on Public authorities under the EIR
for more details.

 

However, if you are a private sector organisation you are likely to be able to consider the legitimate
interests basis as an alternative.

519


--- New Page 81 ---
Page number: 81
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

See the main lawful basis page of this guide for more on how to choose the most appropriate basis.

When can we rely on this basis?

Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) says that the public task basis will cover processing
necessary for:

@ the administration of justice;

® parliamentary functions;

e statutory functions;

® governmental functions; or

@ activities that support or promote democratic engagement.

However, this is not intended as an exhaustive list. If you have other official non-statutory functions or

public interest tasks you can still rely on the public task basis, as long as the underlying legal basis for that
function or task is clear and foreseeable.

For accountability purposes, you should be able to specify the relevant task, function or power, and identify
its basis in common law or statute. You should also ensure that you can demonstrate there is no other
reasonable and less intrusive means to achieve your purpose.

You may share personal information with another controller or individual in the lawful exercise of any of
your public tasks, functions or powers, if it is a clear and foreseeable use of the information. In order to do
so, you should be able to identify the relevant legal basis you are subject to.

However, you cannot rely on another controller’s public tasks, functions or powers as the lawful basis for
your processing, including disclosing personal data to them, as this is not a clear and foreseeable use of the
information.

Example

A government agency has statutory powers to conduct research about the online shopping habits of
consumers. The agency asks retailers to share the personal data of a random sample of their
customers to enable it to carry out this function. It explains that it will process the data under ‘public
task’ once it receives the information.

As the retailers are not subject to the agency’s statutory function, they cannot share the information on
the basis of the agency’s public task. However, they may consider disclosing the information under
another lawful basis, eg legitimate interests.

What else should we consider?

Individuals’ rights to erasure and data portability do not apply if you are processing on the basis of public

520


--- New Page 82 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

task. However, individuals do have a right to object. See our guidance on individual rights for more
information.

You should consider an alternative lawful basis if you are not confident that processing is necessary for a
relevant task, function or power which is clearly set out in law.

If you are a public authority (as defined in the Data Protection Act 2018), your ability to rely on consent or
legitimate interests as an alternative basis is more limited, but they may be available in some
circumstances. In particular, legitimate interests is still available for processing which falls outside your
tasks as a public authority. Other lawful bases may also be relevant. See our guidance on the other lawful
bases for more information.

Remember that the UK GDPR specifically says that further processing for certain purposes should be
considered to be compatible with your original purpose. This means that if you originally processed the
personal data for a relevant task or function, you do not need a separate lawful basis for any further
processing for:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;

e scientific research purposes; or

e statistical purposes.

If you are processing special category data, you also need to identify an additional condition for processing
this type of data. The Data Protection Act 2018 includes specific conditions for parliamentary, statutory or

governmental functions in the substantial public interest. Read the special category data page of this guide
for our latest guidance on these provisions.

To help you meet your accountability and transparency obligations, remember to:

@ document your decision that the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest
or exercise your official authority;

@ identify the relevant task or authority and its basis in common law or statute; and
@ include basic information about your purposes and lawful basis in your privacy notice.

Vital interests

At a glance

@ You are likely to be able to rely on vital interests as your lawful basis if you need to process the personal
data to protect someone’s life.

@ The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably protect the person’s vital interests in another
less intrusive way, this basis will not apply.

@ You cannot rely on vital interests for health data or other special category data if the individual is
capable of giving consent, even if they refuse their consent.

e@ You should consider whether you are likely to rely on this basis, and if so document the circumstances
where it will be relevant and ensure you can justify your reasoning.

In brief

@ What does the UK GDPR say?
@ What are ‘vital interests’?
@ When is the vital interests basis likely to apply?

@ What else should we consider?

What does the UK GDPR say?

Article 6(1)(d) provides a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
person”.

Recital 46 provides some further guidance:

66

“The processing of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an
interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing
of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only
where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis...”

What are ‘vital interests’?

523


--- New Page 85 ---
Page number: 85
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

It’s clear from Recital 46 that vital interests are intended to cover only interests that are essential for
someone's life. So this lawful basis is very limited in its scope, and generally only applies to matters of life
and death.

When is the vital interests basis likely to apply?

It is likely to be particularly relevant for emergency medical care, when you need to process personal data
for medical purposes but the individual is incapable of giving consent to the processing.

Example

An individual is admitted to the A & E department of a hospital with life-threatening injuries following a
serious road accident. The disclosure to the hospital of the individual’s medical history is necessary in
order to protect his/her vital interests.

It is less likely to be appropriate for medical care that is planned in advance. Another lawful basis such as
public task or legitimate interests is likely to be more appropriate in this case.

Processing of one individual’s personal data to protect the vital interests of others is likely to happen more
rarely. It may be relevant, for example, if it is necessary to process a parent’s personal data to protect the
vital interests of a child.

Vital interests is also less likely to be the appropriate basis for processing on a larger scale. Recital 46 does
suggest that vital interests might apply where you are processing on humanitarian grounds such as
monitoring epidemics, or where there is a natural or man-made disaster causing a humanitarian
emergency.

However, if you are processing one person’s personal data to protect someone else’s life, Recital 46 also
indicates that you should generally try to use an alternative lawful basis, unless none is obviously available.
For example, in many cases you could consider legitimate interests, which will give you a framework to
balance the rights and interests of the data subject(s) with the vital interests of the person or people you
are trying to protect.

What else should we consider?

In most cases the protection of vital interests is likely to arise in the context of health data. This is one of
the special categories of data, which means you will also need to identify a condition for processing special
category data under Article 9.

There is a specific condition at Article 9(2)(c) for processing special category data where necessary to
protect someone’s vital interests. However, this only applies if the data subject is physically or legally
incapable of giving consent. This means explicit consent is more appropriate in many cases, and you cannot
in practice rely on vital interests for special category data (including health data) if the data subject refuses
consent, unless they are not competent to do so.

Legal obligation

or statutory obligation.

@ This does not apply to contractual obligations.

e The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably comply without processing the personal data,
this basis does not apply.

In brief

@ When is the lawful basis for legal obligations likely to apply?

@ What else should we consider?

What does the UK GDPR say?

Article 6(1)(c) provides a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.”

When is the lawful basis for legal obligations likely to apply?

In short, when you are obliged to process the personal data to comply with the law.

Article 6(3) requires that the legal obligation must be laid down by UK or EU law. Recital 41 confirms that
this does not have to be an explicit statutory obligation, as long as the application of the law is foreseeable
to those individuals subject to it. So it includes clear common law obligations.

This does not mean that there must be a legal obligation specifically requiring the specific processing
activity. The point is that your overall purpose must be to comply with a legal obligation which has a
sufficiently clear basis in either common law or statute.

You should be able to identify the obligation in question, either by reference to the specific legal provision

526


--- New Page 88 ---
Page number: 88
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

or else by pointing to an appropriate source of advice or guidance that sets it out clearly. For example, you
can refer to a government website or to industry guidance that explains generally applicable legal
obligations.

Example

An employer needs to process personal data to comply with its legal obligation to disclose employee
salary details to HMRC.

The employer can point to the HMRC website where the requirements are set out to demonstrate this
obligation. In this situation it is not necessary to cite each specific piece of legislation.

Example

A financial institution relies on the legal obligation imposed by the Part 7 of Proceeds of Crime Act 2002
to process personal data in order submit a Suspicious Activity Report to the National Crime Agency
when it Knows or suspects that a person is engaged in, or attempting, money laundering.

Example

A court order may require you to process personal data for a particular purpose and this also qualifies
as a legal obligation.

Regulatory requirements also qualify as a legal obligation for these purposes where there is a statutory
basis underpinning the regulatory regime and which requires regulated organisations to comply.

527


--- New Page 89 ---
Page number: 89
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has powers under The Enterprise Act 2002 to make
orders to remedy adverse effects on competition, some of which may require the processing of
personal data.

A retail energy supplier passes customer data to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to comply
with the CMA’s Energy Market Investigation (Database) Order 2016. The supplier may rely on legal
obligation as the lawful basis for this processing.

A contractual obligation does not comprise a legal obligation in this context. You cannot contract out of the
requirement for a lawful basis. However, you can look for a different lawful basis. If the contract is with the
individual you can consider the lawful basis for contracts. For contracts with other parties, you may want to
consider legitimate interests.

When is processing ‘necessary’ for compliance?

Although the processing need not be essential for you to comply with the legal obligation, it must be a
reasonable and proportionate way of achieving compliance. You cannot rely on this lawful basis if you have
discretion over whether to process the personal data, or if there is another reasonable way to comply.

It is likely to be clear from the law in question whether the processing is actually necessary for compliance.

What else should we consider?

If you are processing on the basis of legal obligation, the individual has no right to erasure, right to data
portability, or right to object. Read our guidance on individual rights for more information.

Remember to:

@ document your decision that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation;
e identify an appropriate source for the obligation in question; and

@ include information about your purposes and lawful basis in your privacy notice.

Contract

At a glance

@ You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process someone’s personal data:
@ to deliver a contractual service to them; or
@ because they have asked you to do something before entering into a contract (eg provide a quote).
e The processing must be necessary. If you could reasonably do what they want by processing less data,
or using their data in a less intrusive way, this basis will not apply.

@ You should document your decision to rely on this lawful basis and ensure that you can justify your
reasoning.

In brief

@ When is the lawful basis for contracts likely to apply?
@ When is processing ‘necessary’ for a contract?

@ What else should we consider?

When is the lawful basis for contracts likely to apply?

You have a lawful basis for processing if:
@ you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data to comply with your
obligations under the contract.

@ you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data so that they can
comply with specific counter-obligations under the contract (eg you are processing payment details).

@ you haven't yet got a contract with the individual, but they have asked you to do something as a first
step (eg provide a quote) and you need to process their personal data to do what they ask. This applies
even if they don’t actually go on to enter into a contract with you, as long as the processing was in the
context of a potential contract with that individual.

Example

An individual shopping around for car insurance requests a quotation. The insurer needs to process
certain data in order to prepare the quotation, such as the make and age of the car.

It does not apply if you need to process one person's details but the contract is with someone else.

It does not apply if you collect and reuse your customer’s data for your own business purposes, even if this
is permitted under your standard contractual terms and is part of your funding model.

530


--- New Page 92 ---
Page number: 92
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

It does not apply if you take pre-contractual steps on your own initiative, to meet other obligations, or at
the request of a third party.

Note that, in this context, a contract does not have to be a formal signed document, or even written down,
as long as there is an agreement which meets the requirements of contract law. Broadly speaking, this
means that the terms have been offered and accepted, you both intend them to be legally binding, and
there is an element of exchange (usually an exchange of goods or services for money, but this can be
anything of value). However, this is not a full explanation of contract law, and if in doubt you should seek
your own legal advice.

When is processing ‘necessary’ for a contract?

‘Necessary’ does not mean that the processing must be absolutely essential or ‘the only way’ to perform
the contract or take relevant pre-contractual steps. However, it must be more than just useful, and more
than just part of your standard terms. It must be a targeted and proportionate step which is integral to
delivering the contractual service or taking the requested action. This lawful basis does not apply if there
are other reasonable and less intrusive ways to deliver the contractual service or take the steps requested.

The processing must be necessary to perform the contract with this particular person. If the processing is
instead necessary to maintain your business model more generally, or is included in your terms for other
business purposes beyond delivering the contractual service, this lawful basis will not apply and you should
consider another lawful basis, such as legitimate interests.

Example

When a data subject makes an online purchase, a controller processes the address of the individual in
order to deliver the goods. This is necessary in order to perform the contract.

However, the profiling of an individual’s interests and preferences based on items purchased is not
necessary for the performance of the contract and the controller cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) as the
lawful basis for this processing. Even if this type of targeted advertising is a useful part of your
customer relationship and is a necessary part of your business model, it is not necessary to perform
the contract itself.

This does not mean that processing which is not necessary for the contract is automatically unlawful, but
rather that you need to look for a different lawful basis (and other safeguards such as the right to object
may come into play).

What else should we consider?

If the processing is necessary for a contract with the individual, processing is lawful on this basis and you
do not need to get separate consent.

If processing of special category data is necessary for the contract, you also need to identify a separate

Consent

At a glance

e The UK GDPR sets a high standard for consent. But you often won’t need consent. If consent is difficult,
look for a different lawful basis.

® Consent means offering individuals real choice and control. Genuine consent should put individuals in
charge, build trust and engagement, and enhance your reputation.

e@ Check your consent practices and your existing consents. Refresh your consents if they don’t meet the
UK GDPR standard.

@ Consent requires a positive opt-in. Don’t use pre-ticked boxes or any other method of default consent.
e Explicit consent requires a very clear and specific statement of consent.
@ Keep your consent requests separate from other terms and conditions.

@ Be specific and ‘granular’ so that you get separate consent for separate things. Vague or blanket consent
is not enough.

@ Be clear and concise.

@ Name any third party controllers who will rely on the consent.

e Make it easy for people to withdraw consent and tell them how.

@ Keep evidence of consent - who, when, how, and what you told people.
@ Keep consent under review, and refresh it if anything changes.

@ Avoid making consent to processing a precondition of a service.

e Public authorities and employers will need to take extra care to show that consent is freely given, and
should avoid over-reliance on consent.

@ How should we obtain, record and manage consent?

e@ In detail

Why is consent important?

The UK GDPR sets a high standard for consent, which must be unambiguous and involve a clear affirmative
action (an opt-in).

It specifically bans pre-ticked opt-in boxes. It also requires distinct (‘granular’) consent options for distinct
processing operations. Consent should be separate from other terms and conditions and should not
generally be a precondition of signing up to a service.

You must keep clear records to demonstrate consent.

The UK GDPR gives a specific right to withdraw consent. You need to tell people about their right to
withdraw, and offer them easy ways to withdraw consent at any time.

Public authorities, employers and other organisations in a position of power may find it more difficult to
show valid freely given consent.

You need to review existing consents and your consent mechanisms to check they meet the UK GDPR
standard. If they do, there is no need to obtain fresh consent.

Consent is one lawful basis for processing, and explicit consent can also legitimise use of special category
data. Consent may also be relevant where the individual has exercised their right to restriction, and explicit
consent can legitimise automated decision-making and overseas transfers of data.

Genuine consent should put individuals in control, build trust and engagement, and enhance your
reputation.

Relying on inappropriate or invalid consent could destroy trust and harm your reputation - and may leave
you open to large fines.

When is consent appropriate?

Consent is one lawful basis for processing, but there are alternatives. Consent is not inherently better or
more important than these alternatives. If consent is difficult, you should consider using an alternative.

Consent is appropriate if you can offer people real choice and control over how you use their data, and
want to build their trust and engagement. But if you cannot offer a genuine choice, consent is not
appropriate. If you would still process the personal data without consent, asking for consent is misleading
and inherently unfair.

If you make consent a precondition of a service, it is unlikely to be the most appropriate lawful basis.

Public authorities, employers and other organisations in a position of power over individuals should avoid
relying on consent unless they are confident they can demonstrate it is freely given.

What is valid consent?

535


--- New Page 97 ---
Page number: 97
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Consent must be freely given; this means giving people genuine ongoing choice and control over how you
use their data.

Consent should be obvious and require a positive action to opt in. Consent requests must be prominent,
unbundled from other terms and conditions, concise and easy to understand, and user-friendly.

Consent must specifically cover the controller’s name, the purposes of the processing and the types of
processing activity.

Explicit consent must be expressly confirmed in words, rather than by any other positive action.
There is no set time limit for consent. How long it lasts will depend on the context. You should review and

refresh consent as appropriate.

How should we obtain, record and manage consent?

Make your consent request prominent, concise, separate from other terms and conditions, and easy to
understand. Include:

e@ the name of your organisation;

@ the name of any third party controllers who will rely on the consent;
@ why you want the data;

@ what you will do with it; and

@ that individuals can withdraw consent at any time.

You must ask people to actively opt in. Don’t use pre-ticked boxes, opt-out boxes or other default settings.
Wherever possible, give separate (‘granular’) options to consent to different purposes and different types of
processing.

Keep records to evidence consent — who consented, when, how, and what they were told.

Make it easy for people to withdraw consent at any time they choose. Consider using preference-
management tools.

Keep consents under review and refresh them if anything changes. Build regular consent reviews into your
business processes.

e@ In detail

What is automated individual decision-making and profiling?

Automated individual decision-making is a decision made by automated means without any human
involvement.

Examples of this include:

® an online decision to award a loan; and

® a recruitment aptitude test which uses pre-programmed algorithms and criteria.
Automated individual decision-making does not have to involve profiling, although it often will do.

The UK GDPR says that profiling is:

541


--- New Page 103 ---
Page number: 103
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

“Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.”

[Article 4(4)]

Organisations obtain personal information about individuals from a variety of different sources. Internet
searches, buying habits, lifestyle and behaviour data gathered from mobile phones, social networks, video
surveillance systems and the Internet of Things are examples of the types of data organisations might
collect.

Information is analysed to classify people into different groups or sectors, using algorithms and machine-
learning. This analysis identifies links between different behaviours and characteristics to create profiles for

artificial intelligence, machine learning and data protection.

 

Based on the traits of others who appear similar, organisations use profiling to:

e@ find something out about individuals’ preferences;
@ predict their behaviour; and/or

@ make decisions about them.

This can be very useful for organisations and individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education,
financial services and marketing.

Automated individual decision-making and profiling can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions. But
if they are used irresponsibly there are significant risks for individuals. The UK GDPR provisions are
designed to address these risks.

What does the UK GDPR say about automated individual decision-making and profiling?

The UK GDPR restricts you from making solely automated decisions, including those based on profiling, that
have a legal or similarly significant effect on individuals.

66

“The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated
processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly
significantly affects him or her.”

[Article 22(1)]

542


--- New Page 104 ---
Page number: 104
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

For something to be solely automated there must be no human involvement in the decision-making
process.

The restriction only covers solely automated individual decision-making that produces legal or similarly
significant effects. These types of effect are not defined in the UK GDPR, but the decision must have a
serious impact on an individual to be caught by this provision.

A legal effect is something that affects someone's legal rights. Similarly significant effects are more difficult
to define but would include, for example, automatic refusal of an online credit application, and e-recruiting
practices without human intervention.

When can we carry out this type of processing?

Solely automated individual decision-making - including profiling - with legal or similarly significant effects
is restricted, although this restriction can be lifted in certain circumstances.

You can only carry out solely automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects if the
decision is:

@ necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between an organisation and the individual;
e authorised by law (for example, for the purposes of fraud or tax evasion); or

@ based on the individual’s explicit consent.

If you’re using special category personal data you can only carry out processing described in Article 22(1)
if:

@ you have the individual’s explicit consent; or

@ the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.

What else do we need to consider?

Because this type of processing is considered to be high-risk the UK GDPR requires you to carry out a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to show that you have identified and assessed what those risks are
and how you will address them.

As well as restricting the circumstances in which you can carry out solely automated individual decision-
making (as described in Article 22(1)) the UK GDPR also:

@ requires you to give individuals specific information about the processing;
e@ obliges you to take steps to prevent errors, bias and discrimination; and

@ gives individuals rights to challenge and request a review of the decision.

These provisions are designed to increase individuals’ understanding of how you might be using their
personal data.

You must:

@ provide meaningful information about the logic involved in the decision-making process, as well as the
significance and the envisaged consequences for the individual;

543


--- New Page 105 ---
Page number: 105
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures;
@ ensure that individuals can:
@ obtain human intervention;
® express their point of view; and
@ obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it;
© put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place, so that you can correct inaccuracies and
minimise the risk of errors;

@ secure personal data in a way that is proportionate to the risk to the interests and rights of the
individual, and that prevents discriminatory effects.

What if Article 22 doesn’t apply to our processing?

Article 22 applies to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling, with legal or similarly
significant effects.

If your processing does not match this definition then you can continue to carry out profiling and
automated decision-making.

But you must still comply with the UK GDPR principles.

You must identify and record your lawful basis for the processing.

 

Individuals have a right to object to profiling in certain circumstances. You must bring details of this right
specifically to their attention.

What is the right to object?

Article 21 of the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data at
any time. This effectively allows individuals to stop or prevent you from processing their personal data.

An objection may be in relation to all of the personal data you hold about an individual or only to certain

information. It may also only relate to a particular purpose you are processing the data for.

When does the right to object apply?

The right to object only applies in certain circumstances. Whether it applies depends on your purposes for
processing and your lawful basis for processing.

Individuals have the absolute right to object to the processing of their personal data if it is for direct
marketing purposes.

Individuals can also object if the processing is for:

@ a task carried out in the public interest;
e@ the exercise of official authority vested in you; or

® your legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
In these circumstances the right to object is not absolute.

If you are processing data for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, the right to object is
more limited.

These various grounds are discussed further below.

547


--- New Page 109 ---
Page number: 109
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Direct marketing

An individual can object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing at any time. This
includes any profiling of data that is related to direct marketing.

This is an absolute right and there are no exemptions or grounds for you to refuse. Therefore, when you
receive an objection to processing for direct marketing, you must not process the individual’s data for this
purpose.

However, this does not automatically mean that you need to erase the individual’s personal data, and in
most cases it will be preferable to suppress their details. Suppression involves retaining just enough
information about them to ensure that their preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in
future.

Processing based upon public task or legitimate interests

An individual can also object where you are relying on one of the following lawful bases:

@ ‘public task’ (for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest),
e ‘public task’ (for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or
e legitimate interests.

An individual must give specific reasons why they are objecting to the processing of their data. These
reasons should be based upon their particular situation.

In these circumstances this is not an absolute right, and you can refuse to comply if:

@ you can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests,
rights and freedoms of the individual; or

@ the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

If you are deciding whether you have compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests of an
individual, you should consider the reasons why they have objected to the processing of their data. In
particular, if an individual objects on the grounds that the processing is causing them substantial damage or
distress (eg the processing is causing them financial loss), the grounds for their objection will have more
weight. In making a decision on this, you need to balance the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms
with your own legitimate grounds. During this process you should remember that the responsibility is for
you to be able to demonstrate that your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

If you are satisfied that you do not need to comply with the request you should let the individual know. You
should explain your decision, and inform them of their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another
supervisory authority; and their ability to seek to enforce their rights through a judicial remedy.

Research purposes

Where you are processing personal data for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, the right
to object is more restricted.

Article 21(6) states:

548


--- New Page 110 ---
Page number: 110
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes
pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her personal situation, shall
have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.’

Effectively this means that if you are processing data for these purposes and have appropriate safeguards
in place (eg data minimisation and pseudonymisation where possible) the individual only has a right to
object if your lawful basis for processing is:

@ public task (on the basis that it is necessary for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or

e legitimate interests.

The individual does not have a right to object if your lawful basis for processing is public task because it is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in you).

This may cause difficulties if you are relying on the public task lawful basis for processing. It may not
always be clear whether you are carrying out the processing solely as a task in the public interest, or in the
exercise of official authority. Indeed, it may be difficult to differentiate between the two.

As such, it is good practice that if you are relying upon the public task lawful basis and receive an
objection, you should consider the objection on its own merits and go on to consider the steps outlined in
the next paragraph, rather than refusing it outright. If you do intend to refuse an objection on the basis
that you are carrying out research or statistical work solely for the performance of a public task carried out
in the public interest you should be clear in your privacy notice that you are only carrying out this
processing on this basis.

If you do receive an objection you may be able to continue processing, if you can demonstrate that you
have a compelling legitimate reason or the processing is necessary for legal claims. You need to go through
the steps outlined in the previous section to demonstrate this.

As noted above, if you are satisfied that you do not need to comply with the request you should let the
individual know. You should provide an explanation for your decision, and inform them of their right to

make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority, as well as their ability to seek to enforce
their rights through a judicial remedy.

Do we need to tell individuals about the right to object?

The UK GDPR is clear that you must inform individuals of their right to object at the latest at the time of
your first communication with them where:

® you process personal data for direct marketing purposes, or

e your lawful basis for processing is:

549


--- New Page 111 ---
Page number: 111
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ public task (for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest),
@ public task (for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or
e legitimate interests.

If one of these conditions applies, you should explicitly bring the right to object to the individual’s attention.
You should present this information clearly and separately from any other information.

If you are processing personal data for research or statistical purposes you should include information
about the right to object (along with information about the other rights of the individual) in your privacy
notice.

Do we always need to erase personal data to comply with an objection?

Where you have received an objection to the processing of personal data and you have no grounds to
refuse, you need to stop or not begin processing the data.

This may mean that you need to erase personal data as the definition of processing under the UK GDPR is
broad, and includes storing data. However, as noted above, this will not always be the most appropriate
action to take.

Erasure may not be appropriate if you process the data for other purposes as you need to retain the data
for those purposes. For example, when an individual objects to the processing of their data for direct
marketing, you can place their details onto a suppression list to ensure that you continue to comply with
their objection. However, you need to ensure that the data is clearly marked so that it is not processed for
purposes the individual has objected to.

Can we refuse to comply with an objection for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partly). Not all of the
exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it applies

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or

@ excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to object. For example an individual makes
a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation; or

558


--- New Page 112 ---
Page number: 112
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or

@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

551


--- New Page 113 ---
Page number: 113
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with an objection?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.
You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
e their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise an objection?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid objection. Therefore, an objection to processing can be
made verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have to be to
a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase ‘objection to processing’ or Article 21 of the UK GDPR - as
long as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal objection. However, you
have a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made an objection to you and to handle it
accordingly. Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals
may need specific training to identify an objection.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the objections you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the
objection. We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal objections.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with an objection.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

552


--- New Page 114 ---
Page number: 114
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must comply with an objection without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the
request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

® any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or
@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

553


--- New Page 115 ---
Page number: 115
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the objection you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You need to let the individual know as soon as possible that you need more information from them to
confirm their identity before responding to their objection. The period for responding to the objection
begins when you receive the additional information.

Right to data portability

At a glance

@ The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own
purposes across different services.

@ It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a
safe and secure way, without affecting its usability.

@ Doing this enables individuals to take advantage of applications and services that can use this data to
find them a better deal or help them understand their spending habits.

@ The right only applies to information an individual has provided to a controller.

@ Some organisations in the UK already offer data portability through midata and similar initiatives which
allow individuals to view, access and use their personal consumption and transaction data in a way that
is portable and safe.

What is the right to data portability?

The right to data portability gives individuals the right to receive personal data they have provided to a
controller in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. It also gives them the right to
request that a controller transmits this data directly to another controller.

When does the right apply?

The right to data portability only applies when:

e your lawful basis for processing this information is consent or for the performance of a contract; and

® you are carrying out the processing by automated means (ie excluding paper files).

What does the right apply to?

Information is only within the scope of the right to data portability if it is personal data of the individual
that they have provided to you.

What does ‘provided to a controller’ mean?

Sometimes the personal data an individual has provided to you will be easy to identify (eg their mailing
address, username, age). However, the meaning of data ‘provided to’ you is not limited to this. It is also
personal data resulting from observation of an individual’s activities (eg where using a device or service).

This may include:

e history of website usage or search activities;
e traffic and location data; or

e ‘raw’ data processed by connected objects such as smart meters and wearable devices.

It does not include any additional data that you have created based on the data an individual has provided
to you. For example, if you use the data they have provided to create a user profile then this data would
not be in scope of data portability.

You should however note that if this ‘inferred’ or ‘derived’ data is personal data, you still need to provide it
to an individual if they make a subject access request. Bearing this in mind, if it is clear that the individual
is seeking access to the inferred/derived data, as part of a wider portability request, it would be good
practice to include this data in your response.

Does the right apply to anonymous or pseudonymous data?

The right to data portability only applies to personal data. This means that it does not apply to genuinely
anonymous data. However, pseudonymous data that can be clearly linked back to an individual (eg where
that individual provides the respective identifier) is within scope of the right.

What happens if the personal data includes information about others?

If the requested information includes information about others (eg third party data) you need to consider
whether transmitting that data would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of those third parties.

Generally speaking, providing third party data to the individual making the portability request should not be
a problem, assuming that the requestor provided this data to you within their information in the first place.
However, you should always consider whether there will be an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of
third parties, in particular when you are transmitting data directly to another controller.

If the requested data has been provided to you by multiple data subjects (eg a joint bank account) you
need to be satisfied that all parties agree to the portability request. This means that you may have to seek
agreement from all the parties involved.

What is an individual entitled to?

557


--- New Page 119 ---
Page number: 119
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The right to data portability entitles an individual to:

® receive a copy of their personal data; and/or

@ have their personal data transmitted from one controller to another controller.

Individuals have the right to receive their personal data and store it for further personal use. This allows
the individual to manage and reuse their personal data. For example, an individual wants to retrieve their
contact list from a webmail application to build a wedding list or to store their data in a personal data store.

You can achieve this by either:

@ directly transmitting the requested data to the individual; or

@ providing access to an automated tool that allows the individual to extract the requested data
themselves.

This does not create an obligation for you to allow individuals more general and routine access to your
systems -— only for the extraction of their data following a portability request.

You may have a preferred method of providing the information requested depending on the amount and
complexity of the data requested. In either case, you need to ensure that the method is secure.

What are the limits when transmitting personal data to another controller?

Individuals have the right to ask you to transmit their personal data directly to another controller without
hindrance. If it is technically feasible, you should do this.

You should consider the technical feasibility of a transmission on a request by request basis. The right to
data portability does not create an obligation for you to adopt or maintain processing systems which are
technically compatible with those of other organisations (UK GDPR Recital 68). However, you should take a
reasonable approach, and this should not generally create a barrier to transmission.

Without hindrance means that you should not put in place any legal, technical or financial obstacles
which slow down or prevent the transmission of the personal data to the individual, or to another
organisation.

However, there may be legitimate reasons why you cannot undertake the transmission. For example, if the
transmission would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. It is however your responsibility to
justify why these reasons are legitimate and why they are not a ‘hindrance’ to the transmission.

Do we have responsibility for the personal data we transmit to others?

If you provide information directly to an individual or to another organisation in response to a data
portability request, you are not responsible for any subsequent processing carried out by the individual or
the other organisation. However, you are responsible for the transmission of the data and need to take
appropriate measures to ensure that it is transmitted securely and to the right destination.

If you provide data to an individual, it is possible that they will store the information in a system with less
security than your own. Therefore, you should make individuals aware of this so that they can take steps to
protect the information they have received.

558


--- New Page 120 ---
Page number: 120
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You also need to ensure that you comply with the other provisions in the UK GDPR. For example, whilst
there is no specific obligation under the right to data portability to check and verify the quality of the data
you transmit, you should already have taken reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of this data in order
to comply with the requirements of the accuracy principle of the UK GDPR.

How should we provide the data?

You should provide the personal data in a format that is:

e@ structured;
® commonly used; and

@ machine-readable.

Although these terms are not defined in the UK GDPR these three characteristics can help you decide
whether the format you intend to use is appropriate.

You can also find relevant information in the ‘Open Data Handbook’, published by Open Knowledge
International. The handbook is a guide to ‘open data’, information that is free to access and can be re-used
for any purpose - particularly information held by the public sector. The handbook contains a number of
definitions that are relevant to the right to data portability, and this guidance includes some of these below.

What does ‘structured’ mean?

Structured data allows for easier transfer and increased usability.

The Open Data Handbook defines ‘structured data’ as:

66

‘data where the structural relation between elements is explicit in the way the data is stored ona
computer disk.’

This means that software must be able to extract specific elements of the data. An example of a structured
format is a spreadsheet, where the data is organised into rows and columns, ie it is ‘structured’. In practice,
some of the personal data you process will already be in structured form.

In many cases, if a format is structured it is also machine-readable.

What does ‘commonly used’ mean?

This simply means that the format you choose must be widely-used and well-established.

However, just because a format is ‘commonly used’ does not mean it is appropriate for data portability. You
have to consider whether it is ‘structured’, and ‘machine-readable’ as well. Although you may be using
common software applications, which save data in commonly-used formats, these may not be sufficient to
meet the requirements of data portability.

559


--- New Page 121 ---
Page number: 121
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What does ‘machine-readable’ mean?

The Open Data Handbook states that ‘machine readable’ data is:

66

‘Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer.’

Furthermore, Regulation 2 of the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 defines ‘machine-
readable format’ as:

66

‘A file format structured so that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific
data, including individual statements of fact, and their internal structure.’

Machine-readable data can be made directly available to applications that request that data over the web.
This is undertaken by means of an application programming interface (“API”).

If you are able to implement such a system then you can facilitate data exchanges with individuals and
respond to data portability requests in an easy manner.

Should we use an ‘interoperable’ format?

Although you are not required to use an interoperable format, this is encouraged by the UK GDPR, which
seeks to promote the concept of interoperability. Recital 68 says:

66

‘Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability.’

Interoperability allows different systems to share information and resources. An ‘interoperable format’ is a
type of format that allows data to be exchanged between different systems and be understandable to both.

At the same time, you are not expected to maintain systems that are technically compatible with those of
other organisations. Data portability is intended to produce interoperable systems, not compatible ones.

What formats can we use?

You may already be using an appropriate format within your networks and systems, and/or you may be
required to use a particular format due to the particular industry or sector you are part of. Provided it
meets the requirements of being structured, commonly-used and machine readable then it could be
appropriate for a data portability request.

568


--- New Page 122 ---
Page number: 122
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The UK GDPR does not require you to use open formats internally. Your processing systems may indeed use
proprietary formats which individuals may not be able to access if you provide data to them in these
formats. In these cases you need to perform some additional processing on the personal data in order to
put it into the type of format required by the UK GDPR.

Where no specific format is in common use within your industry or sector, you should provide personal data
using open formats such as CSV, XML and JSON. You may also find that these formats are the easiest for
you to use when answering data portability requests.

For further information on CSV, XML and JSON, please see below.

What is CSV?

CSV stands for ‘Comma Separated Values’. It is defined by the Open Data Handbook as:

66

‘a standard format for spreadsheet data. Data is represented in a plain text file, with each data row on
a new line and commas separating the values on each row. As a very simple open format it is easy to
consume and is widely used for publishing open data.’

CSV is used to exchange data and is widely supported by software applications. Although CSV is not
standardised it is nevertheless structured, commonly used and machine-readable and is therefore an
appropriate format for you to use when responding to a data portability request.

What is XML?

XML stands for ‘Extensible Markup Language’. It is defined by the Open Data Handbook as:

66

‘a simple and powerful standard for representing structured data.’

It is a file format that is intended to be both human readable and machine-readable. Unlike CSV, XML is
defined by a set of open standards maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C’”). It is widely
used for documents, but can also be used to represent data structures such as those used in web services.

This means XML can be processed by APIs, facilitating data exchange. For example, you may develop or
implement an API to exchange personal data in XML format with another organisation. In the context of
data portability, this can allow you to transmit personal data to an individual’s personal data store, or to
another organisation if the individual has asked you to do so.

What is JSON?

JSON stands for ‘JavaScript Object Notation’. The Open Data Handbook defines JSON as:

561


--- New Page 123 ---
Page number: 123
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘a simple but powerful format for data. It can describe complex data structures, is highly machine-
readable as well as reasonably human-readable, and is independent of platform and programming
language, and is therefore a popular format for data interchange between programs and systems.’

It is a file format based on the JavaScript language that many web sites use and is used as a data
interchange format. As with XML, it can be read by humans or machines. It is also a standardised open
format maintained by the W3C.

Are these the only formats we can use?

CSV, XML and JSON are three examples of structured, commonly used and machine-readable formats that
are appropriate for data portability. However, this does not mean you are obliged to use them. Other
formats exist that also meet the requirements of data portability.

Example

The RDF or ‘Resource Description Framework’ format is also a structured, commonly-used, machine-
readable format. It is an open standard published by the W3C and is intended to provide
interoperability between applications exchanging information.

You should however consider the nature of the portability request. If the individual cannot make use of the
format, even if it is structured, commonly-used and machine-readable then the data will be of no use to
them.

What responsibilities do we have when we receive personal data because of a data portability
request?

When you receive personal data that has been transmitted as part of a data portability request, you need
to process this data in line with data protection requirements.

In deciding whether to accept and retain personal data, you should consider whether the data is relevant
and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which you will process it. You also need to consider
whether the data contains any third party information.

As anew controller, you need to ensure that you have an appropriate lawful basis for processing any third
party data and that this processing does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of those third parties.
If you have received personal data which you have no reason to keep, you should delete it as soon as
possible. When you accept and retain data, it becomes your responsibility to ensure that you comply with
the requirements of the UK GDPR.

In particular, if you receive third party data you should not use this for your own purposes. You should keep
the third party data under the sole control of the individual who has made the portability request, and only
used for their own purposes.

563

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

An individual enters into a contract with a controller for the provision of a service. The controller relies
on Article 6(1)(b) to process the individual’s personal data. The controller receives information from a
data portability request that includes information about third parties. The controller has a legitimate
interest to process the third party data under Article 6(1)(f) so that it can provide this service to the
individual. However, it should not then use this data to send direct marketing to the third parties.

When can we refuse to comply with a request for data portability?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for data portability (wholly or partly). Not
all of the exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or
® excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to data portability. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

564


--- New Page 126 ---
Page number: 126
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for data portability?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the
request.

You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and

@ their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

565


--- New Page 127 ---
Page number: 127
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how individuals should make data portability requests. Therefore, requests
could be made verbally or in writing. They can also be made to any part of your organisation and do not
have to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase 'request for data portability’ or a reference to ‘Article 20 of
the UK GDPR’, as long as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid request. However, you have a
legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need
specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

In practice, you may already have processes in place to enable your staff to recognise subject access
requests, such as training or established procedures. You could consider adapting them to ensure your staff
also recognise data portability requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for data portability.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

You must comply with a request for data portability without undue delay and at the latest within one month
of receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

@ any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You need to let the individual know as soon as possible that you need more information from them to
confirm their identity before responding to their request. The period for responding to the request begins
when you receive the additional information.

What is the right to restrict processing?

Article 18 of the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to restrict the processing of their personal data in
certain circumstances. This means that an individual can limit the way that an organisation uses their data.
This is an alternative to requesting the erasure of their data.

Individuals have the right to restrict the processing of their personal data where they have a particular
reason for wanting the restriction. This may be because they have issues with the content of the
information you hold or how you have processed their data. In most cases you will not be required to
restrict an individual’s personal data indefinitely, but will need to have the restriction in place for a certain
period of time.

When does the right to restrict processing apply?

Individuals have the right to request you restrict the processing of their personal data in the following
circumstances:

@ the individual contests the accuracy of their personal data and you are verifying the accuracy of the
data;

e@ the data has been unlawfully processed (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the first principle
of the UK GDPR) and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead;

@ you no longer need the personal data but the individual needs you to keep it in order to establish,
exercise or defend a legal claim; or

@ the individual has objected to you processing their data under Article 21(1), and you are considering
whether your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

Although this is distinct from the right to rectification and the right to object, there are close links between

5708


--- New Page 132 ---
Page number: 132
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

those rights and the right to restrict processing:
e if an individual has challenged the accuracy of their data and asked for you to rectify it (Article 16), they
also have a right to request you restrict processing while you consider their rectification request; or
e if an individual exercises their right to object under Article 21(1), they also have a right to request you

restrict processing while you consider their objection request.

Therefore, as a matter of good practice you should automatically restrict the processing whilst you are
considering its accuracy or the legitimate grounds for processing the personal data in question.

How do we restrict processing?

You need to have processes in place that enable you to restrict personal data if required. It is important to
note that the definition of processing includes a broad range of operations including collection, structuring,
dissemination and erasure of data. Therefore, you should use methods of restriction that are appropriate
for the type of processing you are carrying out.

The UK GDPR suggests a number of different methods that could be used to restrict data, such as:

@ temporarily moving the data to another processing system;

@ making the data unavailable to users; or

@ temporarily removing published data from a website.

It is particularly important that you consider how you store personal data that you no longer need to

process but the individual has requested you restrict (effectively requesting that you do not erase the
data).

If you are using an automated filing system, you need to use technical measures to ensure that any further
processing cannot take place and that the data cannot be changed whilst the restriction is in place. You
should also note on your system that the processing of this data has been restricted.

Can we do anything with restricted data?

You must not process the restricted data in any way except to store it unless:

@ you have the individual’s consent;
e it is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
e it is for the protection of the rights of another person (natural or legal); or

e it is for reasons of important public interest.

Do we have to tell other organisations about the restriction of personal data?

Yes. If you have disclosed the personal data in question to others, you must contact each recipient and
inform them of the restriction of the personal data - unless this proves impossible or involves
disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individual about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,

571


--- New Page 133 ---
Page number: 133
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

When can we lift the restriction?

In many cases the restriction of processing is only temporary, specifically when the restriction is on the
grounds that:
@ the individual has disputed the accuracy of the personal data and you are investigating this; or

e@ the individual has objected to you processing their data on the basis that it is necessary for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the purposes of your legitimate interests, and
you are considering whether your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

Once you have made a decision on the accuracy of the data, or whether your legitimate grounds override
those of the individual, you may decide to lift the restriction.

If you do this, you must inform the individual before you lift the restriction.

As noted above, these two conditions are linked to the right to rectification (Article 16) and the right to
object (Article 21). This means that if you are informing the individual that you are lifting the restriction (on
the grounds that you are satisfied that the data is accurate, or that your legitimate grounds override theirs)
you should also inform them of the reasons for your refusal to act upon their rights under Articles 16 or 21.
You will also need to inform them of their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory
authority; and their ability to seek a judicial remedy.

Can we refuse to comply with a request for restriction?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for restriction (wholly or partly). Not all of
the exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:
e manifestly unfounded; or
° excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or

excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to restriction. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other

572


--- New Page 134 ---
Page number: 134
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
e the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

573


--- New Page 135 ---
Page number: 135
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for restriction?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.
You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
@ their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request
for restriction verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have
to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase 'request for restriction’ or Article 18 of the UK GDPR, as long
as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal request. However, you have
a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need
specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for restriction.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

574


--- New Page 136 ---
Page number: 136
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must comply with a request for restriction without undue delay and at the latest within one month of
receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

® any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

What is the right to erasure?

Under Article 17 of the UK GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased. This is also known
as the ‘right to be forgotten’.

The right only applies to data held at the time the request is received. It does not apply to data that may
be created in the future. The right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.

When does the right to erasure apply?

Individuals have the right to have their personal data erased if:
e@ the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which you originally collected or processed it
for;

® you are relying on consent as your lawful basis for holding the data, and the individual withdraws their
consent;

® you are relying on legitimate interests as your basis for processing, the individual objects to the
processing of their data, and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing;

® you are processing the personal data for direct marketing purposes and the individual objects to that
processing;

@ you have processed the personal data unlawfully (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the 1st
principle);

@ you have to do it to comply with a legal obligation; or

@ you have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.

How does the right to erasure apply to data collected from children?

There is an emphasis on the right to have personal data erased if the request relates to data collected from
children. This reflects the enhanced protection of children’s information, especially in online environments,

578


--- New Page 140 ---
Page number: 140
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

under the UK GDPR.

Therefore, if you process data collected from children, you should give particular weight to any request for
erasure if the processing of the data is based upon consent given by a child —- especially any processing of

their personal data on the internet. This is still the case when the data subject is no longer a child, because
a child may not have been fully aware of the risks involved in the processing at the time of consent.

For further details about the right to erasure and children’s personal data please read our guidance on

Do we have to tell other organisations about the erasure of personal data?

The UK GDPR specifies two circumstances where you should tell other organisations about the erasure of
personal data:

@ the personal data has been disclosed to others; or

@ the personal data has been made public in an online environment (for example on social networks,
forums or websites).

If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the
erasure, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform
the individuals about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,
under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

Where personal data has been made public in an online environment reasonable steps should be taken to
inform other controllers who are processing the personal data to erase links to, copies or replication of that
data. When deciding what steps are reasonable you should take into account available technology and the
cost of implementation.

Do we have to erase personal data from backup systems?

If a valid erasure request is received and no exemption applies then you will have to take steps to ensure
erasure from backup systems as well as live systems. Those steps will depend on your particular
circumstances, your retention schedule (particularly in the context of its backups), and the technical
mechanisms that are available to you.

You must be absolutely clear with individuals as to what will happen to their data when their erasure
request is fulfilled, including in respect of backup systems.

It may be that the erasure request can be instantly fulfilled in respect of live systems, but that the data will
remain within the backup environment for a certain period of time until it is overwritten.

The key issue is to put the backup data ‘beyond use’, even if it cannot be immediately overwritten. You
must ensure that you do not use the data within the backup for any other purpose, ie that the backup is
simply held on your systems until it is replaced in line with an established schedule. Provided this is the
case it may be unlikely that the retention of personal data within the backup would pose a significant risk,

579


--- New Page 141 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

although this will be context specific. For more information on what we mean by ‘putting data beyond use’

When does the right to erasure not apply?

The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:

@ to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
@ to comply with a legal obligation;
e for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;

e for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical purposes
where erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or

e for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If you are required by law to process individuals’ personal data, then the right to erasure will not apply.

The UK GDPR also specifies two circumstances where the right to erasure will not apply to special category
data:

e if the processing is necessary for public health purposes in the public interest (eg protecting against
serious cross-border threats to health, or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care
and of medicinal products or medical devices); or

e if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine; for the working
capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care; or for the
management of health or social care systems or services. This only applies where the data is being
processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to a legal obligation of professional
secrecy (eg a health professional).

Example

An individual who previously worked for an organisation and has now left asks their old employer to
erase all their personal data.

The organisation needs to process personal data to comply with its legal obligation to disclose
employee salary details to HMRC.

The organisation can refuse the request to erase the individual’s data, as they remain under a legal
obligation to process it.

Example
A healthcare provider receives a request from a previous patient to erase all of their personal data.

However, the provider’s liability insurance requires them to retain patient records in case of complaints
or legal claims.

The organisation can refuse the request to erase the individual’s data, as they are processing the data
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Can we refuse to comply with a request for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for erasure (wholly or partly). Not all of

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need
specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for erasure.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

You must respond to a request for erasure without undue delay and at the latest within one month, letting
the individual know whether you have erased the data in question, or that you have refused their request.

The time limit to respond starts on receipt of the request or (if later) on receipt of:

@ any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

@ a fee (only in certain circumstances - see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You must let the individual know without undue delay and within one month that you need more
information from them to confirm their identity. You do not need to comply with the request until you have
received the additional information.

What is the right to rectification?

Under Article 16 of the UK GDPR individuals have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified. An
individual may also be able to have incomplete personal data completed - although this will depend on the
purposes for the processing. This may involve providing a supplementary statement to the incomplete data.

This right has close links to the accuracy principle of the UK GDPR (Article 5(1)(d)). However, although you
may have already taken steps to ensure that the personal data was accurate when you obtained it, this
right imposes a specific obligation to reconsider the accuracy upon request.

What do we need to do?

If you receive a request for rectification you should take reasonable steps to satisfy yourself that the data is
accurate and to rectify the data if necessary. You should take into account the arguments and evidence
provided by the data subject.

What steps are reasonable will depend, in particular, on the nature of the personal data and what it will be
used for. The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort you should put
into checking its accuracy and, if necessary, taking steps to rectify it. For example, you should make a
greater effort to rectify inaccurate personal data if it is used to make significant decisions that will affect an
individual or others, rather than trivial ones.

You may also take into account any steps you have already taken to verify the accuracy of the data prior to
the challenge by the data subject.

When is data inaccurate?

The UK GDPR does not give a definition of the term accuracy. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA
2018) states that personal data is inaccurate if it is incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.

587


--- New Page 149 ---
Page number: 149
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What should we do about data that records a mistake?

Determining whether personal data is inaccurate can be more complex if the data refers to a mistake that
has subsequently been resolved. It may be possible to argue that the record of the mistake is, in itself,
accurate and should be kept. In such circumstances the fact that a mistake was made and the correct
information should also be included in the individuals data.

Example

If a patient is diagnosed by a GP as suffering from a particular illness or condition, but it is later proved
that this is not the case, it is likely that their medical records should record both the initial diagnosis
(even though it was later proved to be incorrect) and the final findings. Whilst the medical record
shows a misdiagnosis, it is an accurate record of the patient's medical treatment. As long as the
medical record contains the up-to-date findings, and this is made clear in the record, it would be
difficult to argue that the record is inaccurate and should be rectified.

What should we do about data that records a disputed opinion?

It is also complex if the data in question records an opinion. Opinions are, by their very nature, subjective,
and it can be difficult to conclude that the record of an opinion is inaccurate. As long as the record shows
clearly that the information is an opinion and, where appropriate, whose opinion it is, it may be difficult to
say that it is inaccurate and needs to be rectified.

What should we do while we are considering the accuracy?

Under Article 18 an individual has the right to request restriction of the processing of their personal data
where they contest its accuracy and you are checking it. As a matter of good practice, you should restrict
the processing of the personal data in question whilst you are verifying its accuracy, whether or not the
individual has exercised their right to restriction. For more information, see our guidance on the right to
restriction.

 

What should we do if we are satisfied that the data is accurate?

You should let the individual know if you are satisfied that the personal data is accurate, and tell them that
you will not be amending the data. You should explain your decision, and inform them of their right to
make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and their ability to seek to enforce their
rights through a judicial remedy.

It is also good practice to place a note on your system indicating that the individual challenges the accuracy
of the data and their reasons for doing so.

Can we refuse to comply with the request for rectification for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partly). Not all of the

588


--- New Page 150 ---
Page number: 150
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it applies

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or
® excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to rectification. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

589


--- New Page 151 ---
Page number: 151
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for rectification?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
e their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How can we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request
for rectification verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not
have to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request to rectify personal data does not need to mention the phrase ‘request for rectification’ or Article
16 of the UK GDPR to be a valid request. As long as the individual has challenged the accuracy of their data
and has asked you to correct it, or has asked that you take steps to complete data held about them that is
incomplete, this will be a valid request under Article 16.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal request. However, you have
a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need

598

specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for rectification.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

You must comply with a request for rectification without undue delay and at the latest within one month of
receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

e any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

 

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

Do we have to tell other organisations if we rectify personal data?

If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the
rectification or completion of the personal data - unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate
effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individual about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,
under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

Page number: 157
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The right of access, commonly referred to as subject access, gives individuals the right to obtain a copy of
their personal data, as well as other supplementary information. It helps individuals to understand how and
why you are using their data, and check you are doing it lawfully.

How do we recognise a subject access request (SAR)?

An individual can make a SAR verbally or in writing, including on social media. A request is valid if it is clear
that the individual is asking for their own personal data. An individual does not need to use a specific form
of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact.

An individual may ask a third party (eg a relative, friend or solicitor) to make a SAR on their behalf. You
may also receive a SAR made on behalf of an individual through an online portal. Before responding, you
need to be satisfied that the third party making the request is entitled to act on behalf of the individual. It
is the third party’s responsibility to provide evidence of their authority.

What about requests for information about children?

Before responding to a SAR for information held about a child, you should consider whether the child is
mature enough to understand their rights. If the request is from a child and you are confident they can
understand their rights, you should usually respond directly to the child. You may, however, allow the
parent or guardian to exercise the child’s rights on their behalf if the child authorises this, or if it is evident
that this is in the best interests of the child. If a child is competent, they may authorise someone else,
other than a parent or guardian, to make a SAR on their behalf.

What should we consider when responding to a request?

You must comply with a SAR without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receiving the
request. You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have
received a number of requests from the individual, eg other types of requests relating to individuals’ rights.

If you process a large amount of information about an individual, you may be able to ask them to specify
the information or processing activities their request relates to, if it is not clear. The time limit for
responding to the request is paused until you receive clarification, although you should supply any of the
supplementary information you can do within one month.

Can we ask for ID?

Yes. You need to be satisfied that you know the identity of the requester (or the person the request is made
on behalf of). If you are unsure, you can ask for information to verify an individual’s identity. The timescale
for responding to a SAR does not begin until you have received the requested information. However, you
should request ID documents promptly.

Can we charge a fee?

Not usually. In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a SAR. However, you can charge a
‘reasonable fee’ for the administrative costs of complying with a request if it is manifestly unfounded or
excessive, or if an individual requests further copies of their data.

596


--- New Page 158 ---
Page number: 158
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

How do we find and retrieve the relevant information?

You should make reasonable efforts to find and retrieve the requested information. However, you are not
required to conduct searches that would be unreasonable or disproportionate to the importance of
providing access to the information.

How should we supply information to the requester?

An individual is entitled to a copy of their personal data and to other supplementary information (which
largely corresponds with the information that you should provide in a privacy notice). If an individual makes
a request electronically, you should provide the information in a commonly used electronic format, unless
the individual requests otherwise.

When deciding what format to use, you should consider both the circumstances of the particular request
and whether the individual has the ability to access the data you provide in that format. It is good practice
to establish the individual’s preferred format prior to fulfilling their request. Alternatives can also include
allowing the individual to access their data remotely and download a copy in an appropriate format.

If an individual asks, you can provide a verbal response to their SAR, provided that you have confirmed
their identity by other means. You should keep a record of the date they made the request, the date you
responded, details of who provided the information and what information you provided.

As the controller of the information you are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure its
security. Please see our detailed guidance ‘How do we provide the information securely?’ for more
information.

 

When can we refuse to comply with a request?

Where an exemption applies, you may refuse to provide all or some of the requested information,
depending on the circumstances. You can also refuse to comply with a SAR if it is manifestly unfounded or

whether a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
If you refuse to comply with a request, you must inform the individual of:

e@ the reasons why;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and

e their ability to seek to enforce this right through the courts.

What should we do if the request involves information about other individuals?

Where possible, you should consider whether it is possible to comply with the request without disclosing
information that identifies another individual. If this is not possible, you do not have to comply with the
request except where the other individual consents to the disclosure or it is reasonable to comply with the
request without that individual’s consent.

Our detailed guidance provides further information on what you need to consider in these circumstances.

You need to respond to the requester whether or not you decide to disclose information about a third party.

597


--- New Page 159 ---
Page number: 159
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must be able to justify your decision to disclose or withhold information about a third party, so you
should keep a record of what you decide and why.

What other exemptions are there?

The exemptions are set out in Schedules 2 and 3 of the DPA 2018 and they are as follows:

@ Crime and taxation: general

@ Crime and taxation: risk assessment

@ Legal professional privilege

e@ Functions designed to protect the public

@ Regulatory functions relating to legal services, the health service and children’s services
e Other regulatory functions

e@ Judicial appointments, independence and proceedings
e@ Journalism, academia, art and literature

@ Research and statistics

@ Archiving in the public interest

@ Health, education and social work data

@ Child abuse data

@ Management information

e@ Negotiations with the requester

© Confidential references

e Exam scripts and exam marks

@ Other exemptions

above are those most likely to apply in practice, the DPA 2018 contains additional exemptions that may be
relevant when dealing with a SAR. For more information, please see our guidance about exemptions.

 

Are there any special cases?

Yes. There are special rules and provisions about SARs and some categories of personal data, including:

® unstructured manual records;
® credit files;

@ health data;

@ educational data; and

e@ social work data.

Can the right of access be enforced?

598


--- New Page 160 ---
Page number: 160
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Yes. In appropriate cases, the ICO may take action against a controller or processor if they fail to comply
with data protection legislation. The ICO will exercise these enforcement powers in accordance with our
Regulatory Action Policy.

If you fail to comply with a SAR, the requester may apply for a court order requiring you to comply or to
seek compensation. It is a matter for the court to decide, in each particular case, what action to take.

Can we force an individual to make a SAR?

No. An enforced SAR is when someone requires an individual to make a SAR to gain access to certain
information about them (eg their convictions, cautions or health records). This information is then used, for
example, as supporting evidence regarding a job application or before entering into a contract for
insurance. Forcing an individual to make a SAR in such circumstances is a criminal offence.

What is the right to be informed and why is it important?

The right to be informed covers some of the key transparency requirements of the UK GDPR. It is about
providing individuals with clear and concise information about what you do with their personal data.

Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR specify what individuals have the right to be informed about. We call this
‘privacy information’.

Using an effective approach can help you to comply with other aspects of the UK GDPR, foster trust with
individuals and obtain more useful information from them.

Getting this wrong can leave you open to fines and lead to reputational damage.

What privacy information should we provide?

The table below summarises the information that you must provide. What you need to tell people differs
slightly depending on whether you collect personal data from the individual it relates to or obtain it from
another source.

What information do we need to provide? Personal data Personal data

decision-making, including profiling

When should we provide privacy information?

When you collect personal data from the individual it relates to, you must provide them with privacy
information at the time you obtain their data.

When you obtain personal data from a source other than the individual it relates to, you need to provide
the individual with privacy information:
e@ within a reasonable period of obtaining the personal data and no later than one month;

e if you use the data to communicate with the individual, at the latest, when the first communication
takes place; or

e if you envisage disclosure to someone else, at the latest, when you disclose the data.
You must actively provide privacy information to individuals. You can meet this requirement by putting the

information on your website, but you must make individuals aware of it and give them an easy way to
access it.

Are there any exceptions?

When collecting personal data from individuals, you do not need to provide them with any information that
they already have.

When obtaining personal data from other sources, you do not need to provide individuals with privacy
information if:

@ the individual already has the information;

® providing the information to the individual would be impossible;

®@ providing the information to the individual would involve a disproportionate effort;

@ providing the information to the individual would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement
of the objectives of the processing;

® you are required by law to obtain or disclose the personal data; or

® you are subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by law that covers the personal data.

How should we draft our privacy information?

604


--- New Page 166 ---
Page number: 166
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

An information audit or data mapping exercise can help you find out what personal data you hold and what
you do with it.

You should think about the intended audience for your privacy information and put yourself in their
position.

If you collect or obtain children’s personal data, you must take particular care to ensure that the
information you provide them with is appropriately written, using clear and plain language.

For all audiences, you must provide information to them in a way that is:

® concise;

@ transparent;

@ intelligible;

e@ easily accessible; and

® uses clear and plain language.

It is good practice to carry out user testing on your draft privacy information to get feedback on how easy it
is to access and understand.

After it is finalised, undertake regular reviews to check it remains accurate and up to date.

If you plan to use personal data for any new purposes, you must update your privacy information and
proactively bring any changes to people’s attention.

What methods can we use to provide privacy information?

There are a number of techniques you can use to provide people with privacy information. You can use:
e A layered approach - short notices containing key privacy information that have additional layers of
more detailed information.

e Dashboards - preference management tools that inform people how you use their data and allow them
to manage what happens with it.

e Just-in-time notices — relevant and focused privacy information delivered at the time you collect
individual pieces of information about people.

@ Icons - small, meaningful, symbols that indicate the existence of a particular type of data processing.

@ Mobile and smart device functionalities — including pop-ups, voice alerts and mobile device
gestures.

Consider the context in which you are collecting personal data. It is good practice to use the same medium
you use to collect personal data to deliver privacy information.

Taking a blended approach, using more than one of these techniques, is often the most effective way to
provide privacy information.

What common issues might come up in practice?

If you share personal data with (or sell it to) other organisations:

605


--- New Page 167 ---
Page number: 167
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ As part of the privacy information you provide, you must tell people who you are giving their information
to, unless you are relying on an exception or an exemption.

® You can tell people the names of the organisations or the categories that they fall within; choose the
option that is most meaningful.

@ It is good practice to use a dashboard to let people manage who their data is sold to, or shared with,
where they have a choice.

If you buy personal data from other organisations:
e@ You must provide people with your own privacy information, unless you are relying on an exception or
an exemption.

e If you think that it is impossible to provide privacy information to individuals, or it would involve a
disproportionate effort, you must carry out a DPIA to find ways to mitigate the risks of the processing.

e If your purpose for using the personal data is different to that for which it was originally obtained, you
must tell people about this, as well as what your lawful basis is for the processing.

e@ Provide people with your privacy information within a reasonable period of buying the data, and no later
than one month.

If you obtain personal data from publicly accessible sources:
@ You still have to provide people with privacy information, unless you are relying on an exception or an
exemption.

e If you think that it is impossible to provide privacy information to individuals, or it would involve a
disproportionate effort, you must carry out a DPIA to find ways to mitigate the risks of the processing.

@ Be very clear with individuals about any unexpected or intrusive uses of personal data, such as
combining information about them from a number of different sources.

@ Provide people with privacy information within a reasonable period of obtaining the data, and no later
than one month.

If you apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) to personal data:

@ Be upfront about it and explain your purposes for using AI.

e If the purposes for processing are unclear at the outset, give people an indication of what you are going
to do with their data. As your processing purposes become clearer, update your privacy information and
actively communicate this to people.

e Inform people about any new uses of personal data before you actually start the processing.

e@ If you use AI to make solely automated decisions about people with legal or similarly significant effects,
tell them what information you use, why it is relevant and what the likely impact is going to be.

@ Consider using just-in-time notices and dashboards which can help to keep people informed and let
them control further uses of their personal data.

Accountability and governance

At a glance

@ Accountability is one of the data protection principles - it makes you responsible for complying with the
UK GDPR and says that you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.

@ You need to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet the requirements of
accountability.

e There are a number of measures that you can, and in some cases must, take including:
@ adopting and implementing data protection policies;
@ taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach;
@ putting written contracts in place with organisations that process personal data on your behalf;
@ maintaining documentation of your processing activities;
@ implementing appropriate security measures;
@ recording and, where necessary, reporting personal data breaches;

® carrying out data protection impact assessments for uses of personal data that are likely to result in
high risk to individuals’ interests;

® appointing a data protection officer; and

@ adhering to relevant codes of conduct and signing up to certification schemes.

@ Accountability obligations are ongoing. You must review and, where necessary, update the measures you
put in place.

e If you implement a privacy management framework this can help you embed your accountability
measures and create a culture of privacy across your organisation.

e@ Being accountable can help you to build trust with individuals and may help you mitigate enforcement
action.

What is accountability?

There are two key elements. First, the accountability principle makes it clear that you are responsible for
complying with the GDPR. Second, you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.

Why is accountability important?

Taking responsibility for what you do with personal data, and demonstrating the steps you have taken to
protect people’s rights not only results in better legal compliance, it also offers you a competitive edge.
Accountability is a real opportunity for you to show, and prove, how you respect people’s privacy. This can
help you to develop and sustain people’s trust.

Furthermore, if something does go wrong, then being able to show that you actively considered the risks
and put in place measures and safeguards can help you provide mitigation against any potential
enforcement action. On the other hand, if you can’t show good data protection practices, it may leave you
open to fines and reputational damage.

What do we need to do?

Accountability is not a box-ticking exercise. Being responsible for compliance with the UK GDPR means
that you need to be proactive and organised about your approach to data protection, while demonstrating
your compliance means that you must be able to evidence the steps you take to comply.

To achieve this, if you are a larger organisation you may choose to put in place a privacy management
framework. This can help you create a culture of commitment to data protection, by embedding systematic
and demonstrable compliance across your organisation. Amongst other things, your framework should
include:

618


--- New Page 172 ---
Page number: 172
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ robust program controls informed by the requirements of the UK GDPR;
® appropriate reporting structures; and
@ assessment and evaluation procedures.

If you are a smaller organisation you will most likely benefit from a smaller scale approach to
accountability. Amongst other things you should:

® ensure a good level of understanding and awareness of data protection amongst your staff;
@ implement comprehensive but proportionate policies and procedures for handling personal data; and
e keep records of what you do and why.

Article 24(1) of the UK GDPR says that:

® you must implement technical and organisational measures to ensure, and demonstrate, compliance
with the UK GDPR;

@ the measures should be risk-based and proportionate; and
® you need to review and update the measures as necessary.

While the UK GDPR does not specify an exhaustive list of things you need to do to be accountable, it does
set out several different measures you can take that will help you get there. These are summarised under
the headings below, with links to the relevant parts of the guide. Some measures you are obliged to take
and some are voluntary. It will differ depending on what personal data you have and what you do with it.
These measures can form the basis of your programme controls if you opt to put in place a privacy
management framework across your organisation.

Should we implement data protection policies?

For many organisations, putting in place relevant policies is a fundamental part of their approach to data
protection compliance. The UK GDPR explicitly says that, where proportionate, implementing data
protection policies is one of the measures you can take to ensure, and demonstrate, compliance.

What you have policies for, and their level of detail, depends on what you do with personal data. If, for
instance, you handle large volumes of personal data, or particularly sensitive information such as special
category data, then you should take greater care to ensure that your policies are robust and
comprehensive.

As well as drafting data protection policies, you should also be able to show that you have implemented and
adhered to them. This could include awareness raising, training, monitoring and audits — all tasks that your
data protection officer can undertake (see below for more on data protection officers).

Should we adopt a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach?

Privacy by design has long been seen as a good practice approach when designing new products, processes
and systems that use personal data. Under the heading ‘data protection by design and by default’, the UK
GDPR legally requires you to take this approach.

Data protection by design and default is an integral element of being accountable. It is about embedding
data protection into everything you do, throughout all your processing operations. The UK GDPR suggests
measures that may be appropriate such as minimising the data you collect, applying pseudonymisation
techniques, and improving security features.

Integrating data protection considerations into your operations helps you to comply with your obligations,
while documenting the decisions you take (often in data protection impact assessments — see below)
demonstrates this.

Do we need to use contracts?

Whenever a controller uses a processor to handle personal data on their behalf, it needs to put in place a
written contract that sets out each party’s responsibilities and liabilities.

Contracts must include certain specific terms as a minimum, such as requiring the processor to take
appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing and obliging it to assist the controller in allowing
individuals to exercise their rights under the UK GDPR.

Using clear and comprehensive contracts with your processors helps to ensure that everyone understands
their data protection obligations and is a good way to demonstrate this formally.

Documentation

What documentation should we maintain?

Under Article 30 of the UK GDPR, most organisations are required to maintain a record of their processing
activities, covering areas such as processing purposes, data sharing and retention.

Documenting this information is a great way to take stock of what you do with personal data. Knowing
what information you have, where it is and what you do with it makes it much easier for you to comply with
other aspects of the UK GDPR such as making sure that the information you hold about people is accurate
and secure.

As well as your record of processing activities under Article 30, you also need to document other things to
show your compliance with the UK GDPR. For instance, you need to keep records of consent and any
personal data breaches.

What security measures should we put in place?

The UK GDPR repeats the requirement to implement technical and organisational measures to comply with
the UK GDPR in the context of security. It says that these measures should ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk.

You need to implement security measures if you are handling any type of personal data, but what you put

613


--- New Page 175 ---
Page number: 175
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

in place depends on your particular circumstances. You need to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the systems and services you use to process personal data.

Amongst other things, this may include information security policies, access controls, security monitoring,
and recovery plans.

How do we record and report personal data breaches?

You must report certain types of personal data breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and
in some circumstances, to the affected individuals as well.

Additionally, the UK GDPR says that you must keep a record of any personal data breaches, regardless of
whether you need to report them or not.

You need to be able to detect, investigate, report (both internally and externally) and document any
breaches. Having robust policies, procedures and reporting structures helps you do this.

EDPB guidelines are no longer directly relevant to the UK regime and are not binding under the UK
regime. However, they may still provide helpful guidance on certain issues.

Should we carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)?

A DPIA is an essential accountability tool and a key part of taking a data protection by design approach to
what you do. It helps you to identify and minimise the data protection risks of any new projects you
undertake.

A DPIA is a legal requirement before carrying out processing likely to result in high risk to individuals’
interests.

When done properly, a DPIA helps you assess how to comply with the requirements of the UK GDPR, while
also acting as documented evidence of your decision-making and the steps you took.

Codes of conduct and certification

 

What else should we consider?

The above measures can help to support an accountable approach to data protection, but it is not limited to
these. You need to be able to prove what steps you have taken to comply. In practice this means keeping
records of what you do and justifying your decisions.

Example

A company wants to use the personal data it holds for a new purpose. It carries out an assessment in
line with Article 6(4) of the UK GDPR, and determines that the new purpose is compatible with the
original purpose for which it collected the personal data. Although this provision of the UK GDPR does
not specify that the company must document its compatibility assessment, it knows that to be
accountable, it needs to be able to prove that their handling of personal data is compliant with the UK
GDPR. The company therefore keeps a record of the compatibility assessment, including its rationale
for the decision and the appropriate safeguards it put in place.

Accountability is not just about being answerable to the regulator; you must also demonstrate your
compliance to individuals. Amongst other things, individuals have the right to be informed about what
personal data you collect, why you use it and who you share it with. Additionally, if you use techniques such
as artificial intelligence and machine learning to make decisions about people, in certain cases individuals
have the right to hold you to account by requesting explanations of those decisions and contesting them.
You therefore need to find effective ways to provide information to people about what you do with their
personal data, and explain and review automated decisions.

The obligations that accountability places on you are ongoing - you cannot simply sign off a particular
processing operation as ‘accountable’ and move on. You must review the measures you implement at
appropriate intervals to ensure that they remain effective. You should update measures that are no longer
fit for purpose. If you regularly change what you do with personal data, or the types of information that
you collect, you should review and update your measures frequently, remembering to document what you
do and why.

On 25 May 2018, the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 (the 2018 Regulations)
came into force, changing the way we fund our data protection work.

Under the 2018 Regulations, organisations that determine the purpose for which personal data is processed
(controllers) must pay a data protection fee unless they are exempt.

The new data protection fee replaces the requirement to ‘notify’ (or register), which was in the Data
Protection Act 1998 (the 1998 Act).

Although the 2018 Regulations come into effect on 25 May 2018, this doesn’t mean everyone now has to
pay the new fee. Controllers who have a current registration (or notification) under the 1998 Act do not
have to pay the new fee until that registration has expired.

From 1 April 2019, the Data Protection (Charges and Information) (Amendment) Regulations 2019
exempted the processing of personal data by members of the House of Lords, elected representatives
and prospective representatives.

‘Elected representatives’ is defined by the Data Protection Act 2018 and includes, but is not limited to,
MPs, MSPs, AMs in Wales, MEPs, elected councillors in county councils, district councils, London
boroughs, parish councils, elected mayors and police and crime commissioners.

‘Prospective representative’ refers to anyone seeking to become an elected representative as defined
above.

Certification

Certification is a way for an organisation to demonstrate compliance with UK GDPR. Certification scheme
criteria will be approved by the ICO and can cover a specific issue or be more general. Once an accredited
certification body has assessed and approved an organisation, it will issue them with a certificate, and a
seal or mark relevant to that scheme.

What is the purpose of certification?

Certification is a way of demonstrating that your processing of personal data complies with the UK GDPR
requirements, in line with the accountability principle. Certification can help demonstrate data protection in
a practical way to businesses, individuals and regulators. Your customers can use certification as a means
to quickly assess the level of data protection of your particular product, process or service, which provides
transparency both for data subjects and in business to business relationships.

The UK GDPR says that certification is also a means to:

620


--- New Page 182 ---
Page number: 182
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ demonstrate compliance with the provisions on data protection by design and by default (Article 25(3));

@ demonstrate that you have appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure data security
(Article 32(3)); and

e@ to support transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations (Article 46(2)(f)).

Who is responsible for certification?

The ICO encourages the use of data protection certification mechanisms as a means to enhance
transparency and compliance with the UK GDPR.

The certification framework involves:

@ us publishing accreditation requirements for certification bodies to meet;

e@ the UK’s national accreditation body, UKAS, accrediting certification bodies and maintaining a public
register;

® us approving and publishing certification criteria;
® accredited certification bodies issuing certification against those criteria;
@ controllers and processors applying for certification and using it to demonstrate compliance; and

@ the ICO maintaining a public register of approved certification schemes.

What can be certified?

The scope of a certification scheme could be quite general and be applied to a variety of different products,
processes or services; or it could be specific, for example, secure storage and protection of personal data
contained within a digital vault.

Certification will relate to specific personal data processing operations that take place in a product, process
or service offered by a controller or processor. Those processing operations will be assessed against the
certification criteria by the accredited certification body.

Certification can only be issued to data controllers and processors and cannot therefore be used to certify
individuals, for example data protection officers.

Article 42(2) also allows for the use of certification schemes for the purpose of demonstrating the existence
of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to UK GDPR for
international transfers of personal data.

What must certification scheme criteria contain?

Certification criteria must be:

e derived from UK GDPR principles and rules, as relevant to the scope of certification, ie:
e lawfulness of processing (Art 6-10)
@ principles of data processing (Art 5)
@ data subjects’ rights (Art 12-23)
e@ obligation to notify data breaches (Art 33)

621


--- New Page 183 ---
Page number: 183
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ obligation of DP by design and default (Art 25)
e@ whether a DPIA has been completed where required (Art35(7)(d)

@ technical and organisational measures put in placeto ensure security (Art 32);

e@ formulated in such a way that they are clear and allow practical application;

e@ auditable (ie specify objectives and how they can be achieved so as to demonstrate compliance);
e@ relevant to the target audience;

@ inter-operable with other standards, for example ISO standards; and

@ scalable for application to different size or type of organisations.

Once your organisation has been successfully assessed by the accredited certification body, you will be
issued with a data protection certificate, seal or mark relevant to that scheme.

Why should we apply for certification of our processing?

Applying for certification is voluntary. However, if there is an approved certification scheme that covers your
processing activity, you may wish to consider working towards it as a way of demonstrating that you
comply with the UK GDPR.

Certification provides a framework for you to follow, thereby helping ensure compliance and offering
assurance that specific standards are being adhered to, for example in a processor to controller
relationship.

Obtaining certification for your processing can also help you to:

@ be more transparent and accountable - enabling businesses or individuals to distinguish which
processing activities, operations and services meet UK GDPR data protection requirements and they can
trust with their personal data;

@ have a competitive advantage;

® create effective safeguards to mitigate the risk around data processing and the rights and freedoms of
individuals;

@ improve standards by establishing best practice;
@ help with international transfers; and

@ mitigate against enforcement action.

What are the practical implications for us?

e As a controller or processor, you could obtain certification for your processing operations within your
products, processes and services. Certification bodies will use independent assessors, giving an
independent expert view on whether you meet the certification criteria. You will need to provide them
with all the necessary information and access to your processing activities to enable them to conduct the
certification procedure.

® Certification is valid for a maximum of three years, subject to periodic reviews. These independent
reviews provide assurance that the certification can be trusted. However, certifications can be withdrawn

622


--- New Page 184 ---
Page number: 184
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

if you no longer meet the certification criteria, and the certification body will notify us of this.

@ Your customers can view your certification in a public register of certificates published by certification
bodies.

®@ Certification can help you demonstrate compliance but does not reduce your wider data protection
responsibilities outside the certified processing activity.

@ When contracting work to third parties, you may wish to consider whether they hold a UK GDPR
certificate for their processing operations, as part of meeting your due diligence requirements under the
UK GDPR.

What happens next?

You can find details of approved certification schemes in the register of certification criteria. If there is a
scheme that meets your needs, you should contact the relevant certification body who is accredited to
operate the scheme.

Codes of conduct

Under the UK GDPR, trade associations and other representative bodies may draw up codes of conduct that
identify and address data protection issues that are important to their members, such as fair and
transparent processing, pseudonymisation or the exercise of people’s rights. They are a good way of
developing sector-specific guidelines to help with compliance with the UK GDPR. There is a real benefit to
developing a code of conduct as it can help to build public trust and confidence in your sector’s ability to
comply with data protection laws.

The ICO is committed to encouraging the development of codes of conduct and will provide advice and
support from the start on:

@ meeting the necessary criteria;

@ the requirements of the UK GDPR; and

® complex areas of data protection.

We welcome informal discussions with organisations as part of your development of your code of conduct
and prior to formal submission. Please read our detailed quidance pages for further information.

 

At a glance

@ Codes of conduct enable a sector to own and resolve key data protection challenges. The ICO see these
as a way of demonstrating accountability and encourage trade associations and bodies who are able to
speak on behalf of a group of organisations, to create codes of conduct.

@ Using an ICO approved code of conduct give assurance that the code and its monitoring is appropriate
and will help you to apply the UK GDPR effectively.

@ Codes of conduct should reflect the requirements of different processing sectors and takes account of

e@ In detail

What are codes of conduct?

Codes of conduct are voluntary accountability tools, enabling sectors to identify and resolve key data
protection challenges in their sector with assurance from ICO that the code, and its monitoring, is
appropriate. They can help you to reflect on your processing activities and ensure you follow rules designed
for your sector to achieve good practice. They are written by an organisation or association representing a
sector in a way that the sector understands and enable sectors to solve these challenges with advice and
support from the ICO.

By signing up to a code of conduct, controllers and processors can ensure they apply the UK GDPR
effectively and in doing so establish operational norms in compliance that ultimately should assist in
bringing down levels of non-compliance. Codes of conduct require a monitoring method, and for private or
non-public authorities, a monitoring body to deliver them.

Why sign up to a code of conduct?

Adhering to a code of conduct shows that you:
e follow UK GDPR requirements for data protection that have been agreed as good practice within your
sector; and

® are appropriately addressing the type of processing you are doing and the related level of risk. For
example, a code may contain specific sectoral requirements when it relates to processing of sensitive
special category personal data.

Adhering to a code of conduct could help you to:

@ be more transparent and accountable;

@ take into account the specific requirements of processing carried out in a sector and improve standards
by following best practice in a cost-effective way;

® promote confidence in a sector by creating effective safeguards to mitigate the risk around processing
activities;

626


--- New Page 188 ---
Page number: 188
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® earn the trust and confidence of data subjects and promote the rights and freedoms of individuals;
@ help with specific data protection areas, such as breach notification and privacy by design; and

@ improve the trust and confidence in your organisation’s compliance with UK GDPR and of the general
public about what happens to their personal data.

What should a code of conduct address?

Codes of conduct should help you to comply with the UK GDPR, and may cover topics such as fair and
transparent processing, legitimate interests, pseudonymisation or alternative, appropriate data protection
processing issues.

Codes of conduct should also reflect the specific needs of controllers and processors in small and medium
enterprises and help them to work together to apply UK GDPR requirements to specific issues that they
face.

Codes should provide added value for their sector, as they will tailor the UK GDPR requirements to the
sector or area of data processing. They could be a cost-effective means to enable compliance with the UK
GDPR for a sector and its members.

Who is responsible for codes of conduct?

Trade associations or bodies who are able to speak on behalf of controllers or processors can create a code
of conduct in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the public where feasible. They can amend
or extend existing codes to comply with UK GDPR requirements. They have to submit the draft code to us

for approval.

We encourage the creation of codes of conduct by actively engaging with sectors to encourage development
and uptake of codes of conduct where the sector would benefit. We will also support organisations who
approach the ICO with a proposal for a code of conduct.

We will:

e@ Provide advice and guidance to bodies considering or developing a code;
e check that codes meet the code criteria set out below;

@ accredit (approve) monitoring bodies;

® approve and publish codes of conduct; and

@ maintain a public register of all approved UK codes of conduct.

How will the ICO approve a code of conduct?

All codes of conduct received will be assessed against the following criteria to ensure that the code
submission addresses the following:
® Outlines the code owner's ability to represent controllers or processors covered by the code.

e@ Includes a concise statement explaining the purpose of the code, the benefits to members and how it
effectively applies the UK GDPR.

e Identifies processing operations that the code covers and the categories of controllers or processors that

627


--- New Page 189 ---
Page number: 189
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

it applies to as well as what the data protection issues are that it intends to address.
@ Identifies suitable monitoring methods to assess code member compliance with the code.

© Identifies the monitoring body and its legal status (only required for codes covering non-public
authorities).

® Outlines the stakeholder consultation and outcomes.
@ Complies with other relevant national legislation, where required.

e@ Specifies whether it is a national code or a code for use as an international transfer tool.

How will compliance with the code be monitored?

All codes of conduct must contain suitable methods to allow for effective monitoring of code member
compliance and outline appropriate action in cases of infringement. In all cases these methods will need to
be clear, suitable and efficient.

Codes of conduct covering the private sector, or any non-public bodies will also have to identify a
monitoring body to fulfil the code monitoring requirements. Monitoring bodies must be accredited
(approved) by the ICO.

How to become a monitoring body

There are a number of requirements that should be met in order for a monitoring body to gain ICO
accreditation. Code owners will need to demonstrate as a minimum how their proposed monitoring body:
@ Is independent from code owners.
® Can act free from sanctions or external influence to ensure that no conflict of interest arises.
@ Has the required knowledge and expertise.
e@ Has established procedures and sufficient resources for the monitoring of compliance with the code.
@ Has an open and transparent complaints handling process.
@ Will communicate to the ICO infringements that lead to suspensions or exclusions of code members.
@ Will review the code to ensure that the code remains relevant and up to date.
@ Has appropriate legal status.

The ICO accreditation requirements can be found here. You can also find out more about monitoring body
accreditation on our detailed guidance pages.

 

 

How can we demonstrate independence for an internal monitoring body?

A code owner will have to demonstrate how the monitoring body can remain impartial from, code members,
the profession, industry or sector to which the code applies.

How this will work in practice will vary depending on the code topic, the sector and the organisations
involved so there is no universal approach to demonstrating independence.

Code owners will need to consider the risks to impartiality and demonstrate how they will minimise or
remove these risks on an ongoing basis.

628


--- New Page 190 ---
Page number: 190
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

We expect that in some cases existing models of self-regulation or co -regulation familiar to representative
bodies and trade associations may be adapted to meet these requirements. Existing good practice in these
areas could all help to prove impartiality, such as:

@ being able to evidence the ability to act free from inappropriate influence;
@ separate decision-making arrangements;
@ separate staff and governance reporting lines;

@ separate funding arrangements or budget management; and

@ technical measures, such as information barriers.

What are the practical implications for our organisation?

@ You can sign up to a code of conduct relevant to your data processing activities or sector. This could be
an extension or an amendment to a current code, or a brand-new code.

e Your customers will be able to view your code membership via the code’s webpage and the ICO’s public
register of UK approved codes of conduct.

@ Once you are assessed as adhering to the code, your compliance with the code will be monitored on a
regular basis. This monitoring provides assurance that the code can be trusted. Your membership can be
withdrawn if you no longer meet the requirements of the code, and the monitoring body will notify us of
this.

@ When contracting work to third parties, you may wish to consider whether they have signed up to a code
of conduct, as part of meeting your due diligence requirements under the UK GDPR.

How do we sign up to become a code member?

The ICO has not yet formally approved any codes of conduct. You may wish to contact your trade
association/representative body or a body able to legitimately speak on your behalf to discuss whether they
are developing a code in your sector.

For further information please see our detailed guidance pages.

 

Next steps

We welcome enquiries from organisations who are considering writing, monitoring or signing up to a code
of conduct, you can find out more about this on the detailed guidance pages.

Data protection officers

At a glance

e The UK GDPR introduces a duty for you to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if you are a public
authority or body, or if you carry out certain types of processing activities.

@ DPOs assist you to monitor internal compliance, inform and advise on your data protection obligations,
provide advice regarding Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and act as a contact point for
data subjects and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

e The DPO must be independent, an expert in data protection, adequately resourced, and report to the
highest management level.

@ A DPO can be an existing employee or externally appointed.
e In some cases several organisations can appoint a single DPO between them.

@ DPOs can help you demonstrate compliance and are part of the enhanced focus on accountability.

Checklists

Appointing a DPO

OU We are a public authority or body and have appointed a DPO (except if we are a court acting in
our judicial capacity).

OU We are not a public authority or body, but we know whether the nature of our processing
activities requires the appointment of a DPO.

OU We have appointed a DPO based on their professional qualities and expert knowledge of data
protection law and practices.

Oo We aren’t required to appoint a DPO under the UK GDPR but we have decided to do so
voluntarily. We understand that the same duties and responsibilities apply had we been required to
appoint a DPO. We support our DPO to the same standards.

Position of the DPO

O Our DPO reports directly to our highest level of management and is given the required
independence to perform their tasks.

O We involve our DPO, in a timely manner, in all issues relating to the protection of personal data.
O Our DPO is sufficiently well resourced to be able to perform their tasks.
O We do not penalise the DPO for performing their duties.

XO We ensure that any other tasks or duties we assign our DPO do not result in a conflict of
interests with their role as a DPO.

631


--- New Page 193 ---
Page number: 193
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Tasks of the DPO

O Our DPO is tasked with monitoring compliance with the UK GDPR and other data protection laws,
our data protection policies, awareness-raising, training, and audits.

O We will take account of our DPO’s advice and the information they provide on our data protection
obligations.

OX When carrying out a DPIA, we seek the advice of our DPO who also monitors the process.

O Our DPO acts as a contact point for the ICO. They co-operate with the ICO, including during prior
consultations under Article 36, and will consult on any other matter.

CO When performing their tasks, our DPO has due regard to the risk associated with processing
operations, and takes into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing.

Accessibility of the DPO

O Our DPO is easily accessible as a point of contact for our employees, individuals and the ICO.

O We have published the contact details of the DPO and communicated them to the ICO.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Under the UK GDPR, you must appoint a DPO if:

® you are a public authority or body (except for courts acting in their judicial capacity);

® your core activities require large scale, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals (for example,
online behaviour tracking); or

® your core activities consist of large scale processing of special categories of data or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences.

This applies to both controllers and processors. You can appoint a DPO if you wish, even if you aren’t
required to. If you decide to voluntarily appoint a DPO you should be aware that the same requirements of
the position and tasks apply had the appointment been mandatory.

Regardless of whether the UK GDPR obliges you to appoint a DPO, you must ensure that your organisation
has sufficient staff and resources to discharge your obligations under the UK GDPR. However, a DPO can
help you operate within the law by advising and helping to monitor compliance. In this way, a DPO can be
seen to play a key role in your organisation’s data protection governance structure and to help improve
accountability.

If you decide that you don’t need to appoint a DPO, either voluntarily or because you don’t meet the above
criteria, it’s a good idea to record this decision to help demonstrate compliance with the accountability
principle.

[4 Does my organisation need a data protection officer (DPO)?

For organisations

What is the definition of a public authority?

Section 7 of the Data Protection Act 2018 defines what a ‘public authority’ and a ‘public body’ are for the
purposes of the UK GDPR.

What are ‘core activities’?

The other two conditions that require you to appoint a DPO only apply when:

® your core activities consist of processing activities, which, by virtue of their nature, scope and / or their
purposes, require the regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale; or

® your core activities consist of processing on a large scale of special category data, or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences.

Your core activities are the primary business activities of your organisation. So, if you need to process
personal data to achieve your key objectives, this is a core activity. This is different to processing personal
data for other secondary purposes, which may be something you do all the time (eg payroll or HR
information), but which is not part of carrying out your primary objectives.

633


--- New Page 195 ---
Page number: 195
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

For most organisations, processing personal data for HR purposes will be a secondary function to their
main business activities and so will not be part of their core activities.

However, a HR service provider necessarily processes personal data as part of its core activities to
provide HR functions for its client organisations. At the same time, it will also process HR information
for its own employees, which will be regarded as an ancillary function and not part of its core activities.

What does ‘regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale’ mean?

There are two key elements to this condition requiring you to appoint a DPO. Although the UK GDPR does
not define ‘regular and systematic monitoring’ or ‘large scale’, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) provided

Protection Board (EDPB) which has endorsed these guidelines. Although these guidelines relate to the EU
version of the GDPR, they are also a useful resource for understanding the requirements of the UK GDPR.

‘Regular and systematic’ monitoring of data subjects includes all forms of tracking and profiling, both online
and offline. An example of this is for the purposes of behavioural advertising.

When determining if processing is on a large scale, the guidelines say you should take the following factors
into consideration:

e the numbers of data subjects concerned;

@ the volume of personal data being processed;

e@ the range of different data items being processed;

@ the geographical extent of the activity; and

e the duration or permanence of the processing activity.

Example

A large retail website uses algorithms to monitor the searches and purchases of its users and, based on
this information, it offers recommendations to them. As this takes place continuously and according to
predefined criteria, it can be considered as regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a
large scale.

What does processing special category data and personal data relating to criminal convictions
and offences on a large scale mean?

Processing special category data or criminal conviction or offences data carries more risk than other

634


--- New Page 196 ---
Page number: 196
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

personal data. So when you process this type of data on a large scale you are required to appoint a DPO,
who can provide more oversight. Again, the factors relevant to large-scale processing can include:

e the numbers of data subjects;

e@ the volume of personal data being processed;

e the range of different data items being processed;
@ the geographical extent of the activity; and

@ the duration or permanence of the activity.

Example

A health insurance company processes a wide range of personal data about a large number of
individuals, including medical conditions and other health information. This can be considered as
processing special category data on a large scale.

What professional qualities should the DPO have?

e The UK GDPR says that you should appoint a DPO on the basis of their professional qualities, and in
particular, experience and expert knowledge of data protection law.

@ It doesn’t specify the precise credentials they are expected to have, but it does say that this should be
proportionate to the type of processing you carry out, taking into consideration the level of protection
the personal data requires.

e So, where the processing of personal data is particularly complex or risky, the knowledge and abilities of
the DPO should be correspondingly advanced enough to provide effective oversight.

e@ It would be an advantage for your DPO to also have a good knowledge of your industry or sector, as well
as your data protection needs and processing activities.

What are the tasks of the DPO?

The DPO’s tasks are defined in Article 39 as:
@ to inform and advise you and your employees about your obligations to comply with the UK GDPR and
other data protection laws;

@ to monitor compliance with the UK GDPR and other data protection laws, and with your data protection
polices, including managing internal data protection activities; raising awareness of data protection
issues, training staff and conducting internal audits;

@ to advise on, and to monitor, data protection impact assessments;
@ to cooperate with the ICO; and

@ to be the first point of contact for the ICO and for individuals whose data is processed (employees,
customers etc).

It’s important to remember that the DPO’s tasks cover all personal data processing activities, not just those
that require their appointment under Article 37(1).

@ When carrying out their tasks the DPO is required to take into account the risk associated with the
processing you are undertaking. They must have regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of
the processing.

e The DPO should prioritise and focus on the more risky activities, for example where special category
data is being processed, or where the potential impact on individuals could be damaging. Therefore,
DPOs should provide risk-based advice to your organisation.

e If you decide not to follow the advice given by your DPO, you should document your reasons to help
demonstrate your accountability.

Can we assign other tasks to the DPO?

The UK GDPR says that you can assign further tasks and duties, so long as they don’t result in a conflict of
interests with the DPO’s primary tasks.

Example

As an example of assigning other tasks, Article 30 requires that organisations must maintain records of
processing operations. There is nothing preventing this task being allocated to the DPO.

Basically this means the DPO cannot hold a position within your organisation that leads him or her to
determine the purposes and the means of the processing of personal data. At the same time, the DPO
shouldn't be expected to manage competing objectives that could result in data protection taking a
secondary role to business interests.

Examples

A company’s head of marketing plans an advertising campaign, including which of the company’s
customers to target, what method of communication and the personal details to use. This person
cannot also be the company’s DPO, as the decision-making is likely to lead to a conflict of interests
between the campaign’s aims and the company’s data protection obligations.

On the other hand, a public authority could appoint its existing FOI officer / records manager as its
DPO. There is no conflict of interests here as these roles are about ensuring information rights
compliance, rather than making decisions about the purposes of processing.

Can the DPO be an existing employee?

Yes. As long as the professional duties of the employee are compatible with the duties of the DPO and do

636


--- New Page 198 ---
Page number: 198
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

not lead to a conflict of interests, you can appoint an existing employee as your DPO, rather than you
having to create a new post.

Can we contract out the role of the DPO?

You can contract out the role of DPO externally, based on a service contract with an individual or an
organisation. It’s important to be aware that an externally-appointed DPO should have the same position,
tasks and duties as an internally-appointed one.

Can we share a DPO with other organisations?

@ You may appoint a single DPO to act for a group of companies or public authorities.

e If your DPO covers several organisations, they must still be able to perform their tasks effectively, taking
into account the structure and size of those organisations. This means you should consider if one DPO
can realistically cover a large or complex collection of organisations. You need to ensure they have the
necessary resources to carry out their role and be supported with a team, if this is appropriate.

e Your DPO must be easily accessible, so their contact details should be readily available to your
employees, to the ICO, and people whose personal data you process.

Can we have more than one DPO?

e The UK GDPR clearly provides that an organisation must appoint a single DPO to carry out the tasks
required in Article 39, but this doesn’t prevent it appointing other data protection specialists as part of a
team to help support the DPO.

e You need to determine the best way to set up your organisation’s DPO function and whether this
necessitates a data protection team. However, there must be an individual designated as the DPO for
the purposes of the UK GDPR who meets the requirements set out in Articles 37-39.

e If you have a team, you should clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of its members and how it
relates to the DPO.

e If you hire data protection specialists other than a DPO, it’s important that they are not referred to as
your DPO, which is a specific role with particular requirements under the UK GDPR.

What do we have to do to support the DPO?

You must ensure that:

e the DPO is involved, closely and in a timely manner, in all data protection matters;
e the DPO reports to the highest management level of your organisation, ie board level;
@ the DPO operates independently and is not dismissed or penalised for performing their tasks;

@ you provide adequate resources (sufficient time, financial, infrastructure, and, where appropriate, staff)
to enable the DPO to meet their UK GDPR obligations, and to maintain their expert level of knowledge;

@ you give the DPO appropriate access to personal data and processing activities;

@ you give the DPO appropriate access to other services within your organisation so that they can receive
essential support, input or information;

@ you seek the advice of your DPO when carrying out a DPIA; and

637


--- New Page 199 ---
Page number: 199
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® you record the details of your DPO as part of your records of processing activities.

This shows the importance of the DPO to your organisation and that you must provide sufficient support so
they can carry out their role independently. Part of this is the requirement for your DPO to report to the
highest level of management. This doesn’t mean the DPO has to be line managed at this level but they
must have direct access to give advice to senior managers who are making decisions about personal data
processing.

What details do we have to publish about the DPO?

The UK GDPR requires you to:

@ publish the contact details of your DPO; and
@ provide them to the ICO.

This is to enable individuals, your employees and the ICO to contact the DPO as needed. You aren’t
required to include the name of the DPO when publishing their contact details but you can choose to
provide this if you think it’s necessary or helpful.

You're also required to provide your DPO’s contact details in the following circumstances:

@ when consulting the ICO under Article 36 about a DPIA; and

@ when providing privacy information to individuals under Articles 13 and 14.

ICO and to those individuals affected by it.

Is the DPO responsible for compliance?

The DPO isn’t personally liable for data protection compliance. As the controller or processor it remains
your responsibility to comply with the UK GDPR. Nevertheless, the DPO clearly plays a crucial role in
helping you to fulfil your organisation’s data protection obligations.

Data protection impact assessments

The Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020. The GDPR has been retained in UK law as the
UK GDPR, and will continue to be read alongside the Data Protection Act 2018, with technical
amendments to ensure it can function in UK law. If you transfer or receive data from overseas please
visit our End of Transition and International Transfers pages. You should make sure you can identify any
data you collected before the end of 2020 about people outside the UK, for further information, see our
Q&A on Legacy Data.

 

On 01 January, there will not be any significant change to the UK data protection regime, or to the
criteria that compel DPIAs. This guidance draws on European resources which we still consider to be
relevant, and so these resources remain part of our DPIA guidance.

We will keep this guidance under review and update it as and when any aspect of your obligations or
our approach changes. Please continue to monitor our website for updates.

At a glance

e A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify and minimise the data
protection risks of a project.

e@ You must do a DPIA for processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. This includes
some specified types of processing. You can use our screening checklists to help you decide when to do
a DPIA.

e@ It is also good practice to do a DPIA for any other major project which requires the processing of
personal data.

@ Your DPIA must:
e describe the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing;
® assess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures;
e identify and assess risks to individuals; and
@ identify any additional measures to mitigate those risks.
@ To assess the level of risk, you must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on

individuals. High risk could result from either a high probability of some harm, or a lower possibility of
serious harm.

@ You should consult your data protection officer (if you have one) and, where appropriate, individuals and
relevant experts. Any processors may also need to assist you.

e If you identify a high risk that you cannot mitigate, you must consult the ICO before starting the
processing.

@ In more detail

What is a DPIA?

A DPIA is a way for you to systematically and comprehensively analyse your processing and help you
identify and minimise data protection risks.

DPIAs should consider compliance risks, but also broader risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals,
including the potential for any significant social or economic disadvantage. The focus is on the potential for
harm -— to individuals or to society at large, whether it is physical, material or non-material.

To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on
individuals.

A DPIA does not have to indicate that all risks have been eradicated. But it should help you document them
and assess whether or not any remaining risks are justified.

DPIAs are a legal requirement for processing that is likely to be high risk. But an effective DPIA can also
bring broader compliance, financial and reputational benefits, helping you demonstrate accountability and

644


--- New Page 206 ---
Page number: 206
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

building trust and engagement with individuals.

A DPIA may cover a single processing operation or a group of similar processing operations. A group of
controllers can do a joint DPIA.

It’s important to embed DPIAs into your organisational processes and ensure the outcome can influence
your plans. A DPIA is not a one-off exercise. You should see it as an ongoing process that is subject to
regular review.

When do we need a DPIA?

You must do a DPIA before you begin any type of processing that is “likely to result in a high risk”. This
means that although you have not yet assessed the actual level of risk, you need to screen for factors that
point to the potential for a widespread or serious impact on individuals.

In particular, the UK GDPR says you must do a DPIA if you plan to:

® use systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects;
® process special category or criminal offence data on a large scale; or

e@ systematically monitor publicly accessible places on a large scale.

When considering if your processing is likely to result in high risk, you should consider the relevant

the guidelines suggest that, in most cases, any processing operation involving two or more of these criteria
requires a DPIA, you may consider in your case that just meeting one criterion could require a DPIA.

The ICO also requires you to do a DPIA if you plan to:

® use innovative technology (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);
e@ use profiling or special category data to decide on access to services;

e profile individuals on a large scale;

® process biometric data (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

® process genetic data (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

@ match data or combine datasets from different sources;

® collect personal data from a source other than the individual without providing them with a privacy
notice (‘invisible processing’) (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

@ track individuals’ location or behaviour (in combination with any of the criteria from the European
guidelines);

@ profile children or target marketing or online services at them; or
® process data that might endanger the individual’s physical health or safety in the event of a security
breach.

You should also think carefully about doing a DPIA for any other processing that is large scale, involves
profiling or monitoring, decides on access to services or opportunities, or involves sensitive data or
vulnerable individuals.

Even if there is no specific indication of likely high risk, it is good practice to do a DPIA for any major new

645

screening exercise.

How do we carry out a DPIA?
A DPIA should begin early in the life of a project, before you start your processing, and run alongside the

planning and development process. It should include these steps:

sm [eC=T aa =e el
EB) Py

&: Inte
outcomes

7: Sign off and

record outcomes

 

You must seek the advice of your data protection officer (if you have one). You should also consult with
individuals and other stakeholders throughout this process.

The process is designed to be flexible and scalable. You can use or adapt our sample DPIA template @, or
create your own. If you want to create your own, you may want to refer to the European guidelines which
set out Criteria for an acceptable DPIAC

 

 

Although publishing a DPIA is not a requirement of UK GDPR, you should actively consider the benefits of
publication. As well as demonstrating compliance, publication can help engender trust and confidence. We
would therefore recommend that you publish your DPIAs, where possible, removing sensitive details if
necessary.

Do we need to consult the ICO?

You don’t need to send every DPIA to the ICO and we expect the percentage sent to us to be small. But
you must consult the ICO if your DPIA identifies a high risk and you cannot take measures to reduce that

risk. You cannot begin the processing until you have consulted us.

If you want your project to proceed effectively then investing time in producing a comprehensive DPIA may

prevent any delays later, if you have to consult with the ICO.
You need to send us a copy of your DPIA.

Once we have the information we need, we will generally respond within eight weeks (although we can
extend this by a further six weeks in complex cases).

We will provide you with a written response advising you whether the risks are acceptable, or whether you
need to take further action. In some cases we may advise you not to carry out the processing because we
consider it would be in breach of the GDPR. In appropriate cases we may issue a formal warning or take
action to ban the processing altogether.

Data protection by design and default

At a glance

@ The UK GDPR requires you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to
implement the data protection principles effectively and safeguard individual rights. This is ‘data
protection by design and by default’.

e@ In essence, this means you have to integrate or ‘bake in’ data protection into your processing activities
and business practices, from the design stage right through the lifecycle.

e@ This concept is not new. Previously known as ‘privacy by design’, it has always been part of data
protection law. The key change with the UK GDPR is that it is now a legal requirement.

® Data protection by design is about considering data protection and privacy issues upfront in everything
you do. It can help you ensure that you comply with the UK GDPR’s fundamental principles and
requirements, and forms part of the focus on accountability.

What does the UK GDPR say about data protection by design and by default?

The UK GDPR requires you to integrate data protection concerns into every aspect of your processing
activities. This approach is ‘data protection by design and by default’. It is a key element of the UK GDPR’s
risk-based approach and its focus on accountability, ie your ability to demonstrate how you are complying
with its requirements.

Some organisations already adopt a ‘privacy by design approach’ as a matter of good practice. If this is the
case for you, then you are well-placed to meet the requirements of data protection by design and by
default. However, you may still need to review your processes and procedures to ensure that you are
meeting your obligations.

Articles 25(1) and 25(2) of the GDPR outline your obligations concerning data protection by design and by
default.

Article 25(1) specifies the requirements for data protection by design:

649


--- New Page 211 ---
Page number: 211
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and
purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of
natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of
the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection
principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards
into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data
subjects.’

Article 25(2) specifies the requirements for data protection by default:

66

‘The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by
default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are
processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their
processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure
that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an
indefinite number of natural persons.’

Article 25(3) states that if you adhere to an approved certification under Article 42, you can use this as one
way of demonstrating your compliance with these requirements.

What is data protection by design?

Data protection by design is ultimately an approach that ensures you consider privacy and data protection
issues at the design phase of any system, service, product or process and then throughout the lifecycle.

As expressed by the UK GDPR, it requires you to:

@ put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement the data
protection principles effectively; and

@ integrate safeguards into your processing so that you meet the UK GDPR's requirements and protect
individual rights.

In essence this means you have to integrate or ‘bake in’ data protection into your processing activities and
business practices.

650

Data protection by design has broad application. Examples include:

e developing new IT systems, services, products and processes that involve processing personal data;

e developing organisational policies, processes, business practices and/or strategies that have privacy
implications;

@ physical design;
@ embarking on data sharing initiatives; or
® using personal data for new purposes.

The underlying concepts of data protection by design are not new. Under the name ‘privacy by design’ they
have existed for many years.

What is data protection by default?

Data protection by default requires you to ensure that you only process the data that is necessary to

You have to process some personal data to achieve your purpose(s). Data protection by default means you
need to specify this data before the processing starts, appropriately inform individuals and only process the
data you need for your purpose. It does not require you to adopt a ‘default to off’ solution. What you need
to do depends on the circumstances of your processing and the risks posed to individuals.

Nevertheless, you must consider things like:

@ adopting a ‘privacy-first’ approach with any default settings of systems and applications;
@ ensuring you do not provide an illusory choice to individuals relating to the data you will process;
@ not processing additional data unless the individual decides you can;

® ensuring that personal data is not automatically made publicly available to others unless the individual
decides to make it so; and

@ providing individuals with sufficient controls and options to exercise their rights.

Who is responsible for complying with data protection by design and by default?

Article 25 specifies that, as the controller, you have responsibility for complying with data protection by
design and by default. Depending on your circumstances, you may have different requirements for different
areas within your organisation. For example:

® your senior management, eg developing a culture of ‘privacy awareness’ and ensuring you develop
policies and procedures with data protection in mind;

@ your software engineers, system architects and application developers, eg those who design systems,
products and services should take account of data protection requirements and assist you in complying
with your obligations; and

® your business practices, eg you should ensure that you embed data protection by design in all your
internal processes and procedures.

This may not apply to all organisations, of course. However, data protection by design is about adopting an

651


--- New Page 213 ---
Page number: 213
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

organisation-wide approach to data protection, and ‘baking in’ privacy considerations into any processing
activity you undertake. It doesn’t apply only if you are the type of organisation that has your own software
developers and systems architects.

In considering whether to impose a penalty, the ICO will take into account the technical and organisational
measures you have put in place in respect of data protection by design. Additionally, under the Data
Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) we can issue an Enforcement Notice against you for any failings in respect
of Article 25.

What about data processors?

If you use another organisation to process personal data on your behalf, then that organisation is a data
processor under the UK GDPR.

Article 25 does not mention data processors specifically. However, Article 28 specifies the considerations
you must take whenever you are selecting a processor. For example, you must only use processors that
provide:

66

‘sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a
manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of
the rights of the data subject’

This requirement covers both data protection by design in Article 25 as well as other aspects (eg your
security obligations under Article 32). Your processor cannot necessarily assist you with your data
protection by design obligations (unlike with security measures), however you must only use processors
that provide sufficient guarantees to meet the UK GDPR’s requirements.

What about other parties?

Data protection by design and by default can also impact organisations other than controllers and
processors. Depending on your processing activity, other parties may be involved, even if this is just where
you purchase a product or service that you then use in your processing. Examples include manufacturers,
product developers, application developers and service providers.

Recital 78 extends the concepts of data protection by design to other organisations, although it does not
place a requirement on them to comply —- that remains with you as the controller. It says:

66

‘When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on
the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers of the products,
services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when

developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with regard to the state of the

art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations.’

Therefore, when considering what products and services you need for your processing, you should look to
choose those where the designers and developers have taken data protection into account. This can help to
ensure that your processing adheres to the data protection by design requirements.

If you are a developer or designer of products, services and applications, the UK GDPR places no specific
obligations on you about how you design and build these products. (You may have specific obligations as a
controller in your own right, eg for any employee data.) However, you should note that controllers are
required to consider data protection by design when selecting services and products for use in their data
processing activities — therefore if you design these products with data protection in mind, you may be ina
better position.

What are we required to do?

You must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement the data
protection principles effectively and safeguard individual rights.

There is no ‘one size fits all’ method to do this, and no one set of measures that you should put in place. It
depends on your circumstances.

The key is that you consider data protection issues from the start of any processing activity, and adopt
appropriate policies and measures that meet the requirements of data protection by design and by default.

Some examples of how you can do this include:

® minimising the processing of personal data;

@ pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible;

® ensuring transparency in respect of the functions and processing of personal data;
@ enabling individuals to monitor the processing; and

® creating (and improving) security features.

This is not an exhaustive list. Complying with data protection by design and by default may require you to
do much more than the above.

However, we cannot provide a complete guide to all aspects of data protection by design and by default in
all circumstances. This guidance identifies the main points for you to consider. Depending on the processing
you are doing, you may need to obtain specialist advice that goes beyond the scope of this guidance.

When should we do this?

Data protection by design starts at the initial phase of any system, service, product, or process. You
should begin by considering your intended processing activities, the risks that these may pose to
individuals, and the possible measures available to ensure that you comply with the data protection
principles and protect individual rights. These considerations must cover:

@ the state of the art and costs of implementation of any measures;
e the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing; and

e the risks that your processing poses to the rights and freedoms of individuals.
This is similar to the information risk assessment you should do when considering your security measures.

These considerations lead into the second step, where you put in place actual technical and organisational
measures to implement the data protection principles and integrate safeguards into your processing.

This is why there is no single solution or process that applies to every organisation or every processing
activity, although there are a number of commonalities that may apply to your specific circumstances as
described below.

The UK GDPR requires you to take these actions:

e ‘at the time of the determination of the means of the processing’ - in other words, when you are at the
design phase of any processing activity; and

e ‘at the time of the processing itself’ - ie during the lifecycle of your processing activity.

What are the underlying concepts of data protection by design and by default?

The underlying concepts are essentially expressed in the seven ‘foundational principles’ of privacy by
design, as developed by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

Although privacy by design is not necessarily equivalent to data protection by design, these foundational
principles can nevertheless underpin any approach you take.

‘Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial’

You should take a proactive approach to data protection and anticipate privacy issues and risks before they
happen, instead of waiting until after the fact. This doesn’t just apply in the context of systems design - it
involves developing a culture of ‘privacy awareness’ across your organisation.

‘Privacy as the default setting’

You should design any system, service, product, and/or business practice to protect personal data
automatically. With privacy built into the system, the individual does not have to take any steps to protect
their data — their privacy remains intact without them having to do anything.

‘Privacy embedded into design’

Embed data protection into the design of any systems, services, products and business practices. You
should ensure data protection forms part of the core functions of any system or service - essentially, it

654


--- New Page 216 ---
Page number: 216
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

becomes integral to these systems and services.

‘Full functionality — positive sum, not zero sum’

Also referred to as ‘win-win’, this principle is essentially about avoiding trade-offs, such as the belief that in
any system or service it is only possible to have privacy or security, not privacy and security. Instead, you
should look to incorporate all legitimate objectives whilst ensuring you comply with your obligations.

‘End-to-end security — full lifecycle protection’

Put in place strong security measures from the beginning, and extend this security throughout the ‘data
lifecycle’ — ie process the data securely and then destroy it securely when you no longer need it.

‘Visibility and transparency —- keep it open’

Ensure that whatever business practice or technology you use operates according to its premises and
objectives, and is independently verifiable. It is also about ensuring visibility and transparency to
individuals, such as making sure they know what data you process and for what purpose(s) you process it.

‘Respect for user privacy — keep it user-centric’

Keep the interest of individuals paramount in the design and implementation of any system or service, eg
by offering strong privacy defaults, providing individuals with controls, and ensuring appropriate notice is
given.

How do we do this in practice?

One means of putting these concepts into practice is to develop a set of practical, actionable guidelines that
you can use in your organisation, framed by your assessment of the risks posed and the measures available
to you. You could base these upon the seven foundational principles.

However, how you go about doing this depends on your circumstances - who you are, what you are doing,
the resources you have available, and the nature of the data you process. You may not need to have a set
of documents and organisational controls in place, although in some situations you will be required to have
certain documents available concerning your processing.

The key is to take an organisational approach that achieves certain outcomes, such as ensuring that:
® you consider data protection issues as part of the design and implementation of systems, services,

products and business practices;

@ you make data protection an essential component of the core functionality of your processing systems
and services;

® you only process the personal data that you need in relation to your purposes(s), and that you only use
the data for those purposes;

® personal data is automatically protected in any IT system, service, product, and/or business practice, so
that individuals should not have to take any specific action to protect their privacy;

@ the identity and contact information of those responsible for data protection are available both within

655


--- New Page 217 ---
Page number: 217
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

your organisation and to individuals;

@ you adopt a ‘plain language’ policy for any public documents so that individuals easily understand what
you are doing with their personal data;

@ you provide individuals with tools so they can determine how you are using their personal data, and
whether you are properly enforcing your policies; and

e@ you offer strong privacy defaults, user-friendly options and controls, and respect user preferences.
Many of these relate to other obligations in the UK GDPR, such as transparency requirements,
documentation, Data Protection Officers and DPIAs. This shows the broad nature of data protection by

design and how it applies to all aspects of your processing. Our guidance on these topics will help you when
you consider the measures you need to put in place for data protection by design and by default.

the EU GDPR.

The EDPB has adopted guidelines on Data Protection by Design and Default.

 

EDPB guidelines are no longer directly relevant to the UK regime and are not binding under the UK

We will produce further guidance on how you can implement data protection by design soon. However,
the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario has published guidance on how organisations can
‘operationalise’ privacy by design, which may assist you.

 

 

How does data protection by design and by default link to data protection impact assessments
(DPIAs)?

A DPIA is a tool that you can use to identify and reduce the data protection risks of your processing
activities. They can also help you to design more efficient and effective processes for handling personal
data.

656


--- New Page 218 ---
Page number: 218
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

DPIAs are an integral part of data protection by design and by default. For example, they can determine
the type of technical and organisational measures you need in order to ensure your processing complies
with the data protection principles.

However, a DPIA is only required in certain circumstances, such as where the processing is likely to result
in a risk to rights and freedoms, though it is good practice to undertake a DPIA anyway. In contrast, data
protection by design is a broader concept, as it applies organisationally and requires you to take certain
considerations even before you decide whether your processing is likely to result in a high risk or not.

What is the role of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)?

Privacy-enhancing technologies or PETs are technologies that embody fundamental data protection
principles by minimising personal data use, maximising data security, and empowering individuals. A useful
definition from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) refers to PETs as:

‘software and hardware solutions, ie systems encompassing technical processes, methods or knowledge
to achieve specific privacy or data protection functionality or to protect against risks of privacy of an
individual or a group of natural persons.’

PETs link closely to the concept of privacy by design, and therefore apply to the technical measures you can
put in place. They can assist you in complying with the data protection principles and are a means of
implementing data protection by design within your organisation on a technical level.

on PETs that may assist you.

What about international transfers?

Data protection by design also applies in the context of international transfers in cases where you intend to
transfer personal data overseas to a third country that does not have an adequacy decision.

You need to ensure that, whatever mechanism you use, appropriate safeguards are in place for these
transfers. As detailed in Recital 108, these safeguards need to include compliance with data protection by
design and by default.

Article 25(3) says that:

66

‘An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.’

This means that being certified through an ICO approved certification scheme can assist you in showing
how you are complying with, and implementing, data protection by design and by default.

@ In more detail

When is a contract needed and why is it important?

Whenever a controller uses a processor to process personal data on their behalf, a written contract needs to
be in place between the parties.

Similarly, if a processor uses another organisation (ie a sub-processor) to help it process personal data for
a controller, it needs to have a written contract in place with that sub-processor.

Contracts between controllers and processors ensure they both understand their obligations, responsibilities
and liabilities. Contracts also help them comply with the UK GDPR, and assist controllers in demonstrating
to individuals and regulators their compliance as required by the accountability principle.

What needs to be included in the contract?

Contracts must set out:

@ the subject matter and duration of the processing;
e the nature and purpose of the processing;
@ the type of personal data and categories of data subject; and

@ the controller’s obligations and rights.
Contracts must also include specific terms or clauses regarding:

@ processing only on the controller’s documented instructions;

@ the duty of confidence;

666

® appropriate security measures;
® using sub-processors;

e data subjects’ rights;

@ assisting the controller;

@ end-of-contract provisions; and

@ audits and inspections.

What responsibilities and liabilities do controllers have when using a processor?

Controllers must only use processors that can give sufficient guarantees they will implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure their processing will meet UK GDPR requirements and
protect data subjects’ rights.

Controllers are primarily responsible for overall compliance with the UK GDPR, and for demonstrating that
compliance. If this isn’t achieved, they may be liable to pay damages in legal proceedings or be subject to
fines or other penalties or corrective measures.

What responsibilities and liabilities do processors have in their own right?

In addition to its contractual obligations to the controller, a processor has some direct responsibilities under
the UK GDPR. If a processor fails to meet its obligations, or acts outside or against the controller’s
instructions, it may be liable to pay damages in legal proceedings or be subject to fines or other penalties
or corrective measures.

A processor may not engage a sub-processor’s services without the controller’s prior specific or general
written authorisation. If authorisation is given, the processor must put in place a contract with the
sub-processor. The terms of the contract that relate to Article 28(3) must offer an equivalent level of
protection for the personal data as those in the contract between the controller and processor. Processors
remain liable to the controller for the compliance of any sub-processors they engage.

Security

At a glance

e A key principle of the UK GDPR is that you process personal data securely by means of ‘appropriate
technical and organisational measures’ - this is the ‘security principle’.

@ Doing this requires you to consider things like risk analysis, organisational policies, and physical and
technical measures.

@ You also have to take into account additional requirements about the security of your processing - and
these also apply to data processors.

@ You can consider the state of the art and costs of implementation when deciding what measures to take
—- but they must be appropriate both to your circumstances and the risk your processing poses.

e@ Where appropriate, you should look to use measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption.

e Your measures must ensure the ‘confidentiality, integrity and availability’ of your systems and services
and the personal data you process within them.

e The measures must also enable you to restore access and availability to personal data in a timely
manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

e You also need to ensure that you have appropriate processes in place to test the effectiveness of your
measures, and undertake any required improvements.

@ We have worked closely with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to develop an approach that
you can use when assessing the measures that will be appropriate for you.

OO We undertake an analysis of the risks presented by our processing, and use this to assess the
appropriate level of security we need to put in place.

You can refer to this as the UK GDPR’s ‘security principle’. It concerns the broad concept of information
security.

This means that you must have appropriate security in place to prevent the personal data you hold being
accidentally or deliberately compromised. You should remember that while information security is
sometimes considered as cybersecurity (the protection of your networks and information systems from
attack), it also covers other things like physical and organisational security measures.

You need to consider the security principle alongside Article 32 of the UK GDPR, which provides more
specifics on the security of your processing. Article 32(1) states:

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk’

Why should we worry about information security?

Poor information security leaves your systems and services at risk and may cause real harm and distress to
individuals — lives may even be endangered in some extreme cases.

Some examples of the harm caused by the loss or abuse of personal data include:

@ identity fraud;

e fake credit card transactions;

e@ targeting of individuals by fraudsters, potentially made more convincing by compromised personal data;
@ witnesses put at risk of physical harm or intimidation;

e offenders at risk from vigilantes;

® exposure of the addresses of service personnel, police and prison officers, and those at risk of domestic
violence;

678


--- New Page 232 ---
Page number: 232
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

e@ fake applications for tax credits; and

@ mortgage fraud.

Although these consequences do not always happen, you should recognise that individuals are still entitled
to be protected from less serious kinds of harm, for example embarrassment or inconvenience.

Information security is important, not only because it is itself a legal requirement, but also because it can
support good data governance and help you demonstrate your compliance with other aspects of the
UK GDPR.

The ICO is also required to consider the technical and organisational measures you had in place when
considering an administrative fine.

What do our security measures need to protect?

The security principle goes beyond the way you store or transmit information. Every aspect of your
processing of personal data is covered, not just cybersecurity. This means the security measures you put in
place should seek to ensure that:

e the data can be accessed, altered, disclosed or deleted only by those you have authorised to do so (and
that those people only act within the scope of the authority you give them);

e@ the data you hold is accurate and complete in relation to why you are processing it; and

e the data remains accessible and usable, ie, if personal data is accidentally lost, altered or destroyed, you

should be able to recover it and therefore prevent any damage or distress to the individuals concerned.

These are known as ‘confidentiality, integrity and availability’ and under the UK GDPR, they form part of
your obligations.

What level of security is required?

The UK GDPR does not define the security measures that you should have in place. It requires you to have
a level of security that is ‘appropriate’ to the risks presented by your processing. You need to consider this
in relation to the state of the art and costs of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context and
purpose of your processing.

This reflects both the UK GDPR’s risk-based approach, and that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to
information security. It means that what's ‘appropriate’ for you will depend on your own circumstances, the
processing you’re doing, and the risks it presents to your organisation.

So, before deciding what measures are appropriate, you need to assess your information risk. You should
review the personal data you hold and the way you use it in order to assess how valuable, sensitive or
confidential it is - as well as the damage or distress that may be caused if the data was compromised. You
should also take account of factors such as:

e the nature and extent of your organisation’s premises and computer systems;
@ the number of staff you have and the extent of their access to personal data; and

® any personal data held or used by a data processor acting on your behalf.

We cannot provide a complete guide to all aspects of security in all circumstances for all organisations, but
this guidance is intended to identify the main points for you to consider.

What organisational measures do we need to consider?

Carrying out an information risk assessment is one example of an organisational measure, but you will
need to take other measures as well. You should aim to build a culture of security awareness within your
organisation. You should identify a person with day-to-day responsibility for information security within
your organisation and make sure this person has the appropriate resources and authority to do their job
effectively.

Example

The Chief Executive of a medium-sized organisation asks the Director of Resources to ensure that
appropriate security measures are in place, and that regular reports are made to the board.

The Resources Department takes responsibility for designing and implementing the organisation’s
security policy, writing procedures for staff to follow, organising staff training, checking whether
security measures are actually being adhered to and investigating security incidents.

Clear accountability for security will ensure that you do not overlook these issues, and that your overall
security posture does not become flawed or out of date.

Although an information security policy is an example of an appropriate organisational measure, you may
not need a ‘formal’ policy document or an associated set of policies in specific areas. It depends on your
size and the amount and nature of the personal data you process, and the way you use that data. However,
having a policy does enable you to demonstrate how you are taking steps to comply with the security
principle.

Whether or not you have such a policy, you still need to consider security and other related matters such
as:

® co-ordination between key people in your organisation (eg the security manager will need to know about
commissioning and disposing of any IT equipment);

® access to premises or equipment given to anyone outside your organisation (eg for computer
maintenance) and the additional security considerations this will generate;

e@ business continuity arrangements that identify how you will protect and recover any personal data you
hold; and

® periodic checks to ensure that your security measures remain appropriate and up to date.

672

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What technical measures do we need to consider?

Technical measures are sometimes thought of as the protection of personal data held in computers and
networks. Whilst these are of obvious importance, many security incidents can be due to the theft or loss of
equipment, the abandonment of old computers or hard-copy records being lost, stolen or incorrectly
disposed of. Technical measures therefore include both physical and computer or IT security.

When considering physical security, you should look at factors such as:

@ the quality of doors and locks, and the protection of your premises by such means as alarms, security
lighting or CCTV;

@ how you control access to your premises, and how visitors are supervised;

@ how you dispose of any paper and electronic waste; and

@ how you keep IT equipment, particularly mobile devices, secure.

In the IT context, technical measures may sometimes be referred to as ‘cybersecurity’. This is a complex
technical area that is constantly evolving, with new threats and vulnerabilities always emerging. It may
therefore be sensible to assume that your systems are vulnerable and take steps to protect them.

When considering cybersecurity, you should look at factors such as:
@ system security - the security of your network and information systems, including those which process

personal data;

e data security — the security of the data you hold within your systems, eg ensuring appropriate access
controls are in place and that data is held securely;

® online security - eg the security of your website and any other online service or application that you
use; and

@ device security - including policies on Bring-your-own-Device (BYOD) if you offer it.

Depending on the sophistication of your systems, your usage requirements and the technical expertise of
your staff, you may need to obtain specialist information security advice that goes beyond the scope of this
guidance. However, it’s also the case that you may not need a great deal of time and resources to secure
your systems and the personal data they process.

Whatever you do, you should remember the following:
® your cybersecurity measures need to be appropriate to the size and use of your network and information

systems;

@ you should take into account the state of technological development, but you are also able to consider
the costs of implementation;

® your security must be appropriate to your business practices. For example, if you offer staff the ability to
work from home, you need to put measures in place to ensure that this does not compromise your
security; and

® your measures must be appropriate to the nature of the personal data you hold and the harm that might
result from any compromise.

A good starting point is to make sure that you’re in line with the requirements of Cyber Essentials - a
government scheme that includes a set of basic technical controls you can put in place relatively easily.

673

You should however be aware that you may have to go beyond these requirements, depending on your
processing activities. Cyber Essentials is only intended to provide a ‘base’ set of controls, and won’t address
the circumstances of every organisation or the risks posed by every processing operation.

What if we operate in a sector that has its own security requirements?

Some industries have specific security requirements or require you to adhere to certain frameworks or
standards. These may be set collectively, for example by industry bodies or trade associations, or could be
set by other regulators. If you operate in these sectors, you need to be aware of their requirements,
particularly if specific technical measures are specified.

674


--- New Page 236 ---
Page number: 236
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Although following these requirements will not necessarily equate to compliance with the UK GDPR’s
security principle, the ICO will nevertheless consider these carefully in any considerations of regulatory
action. It can be the case that they specify certain measures that you should have, and that those
measures contribute to your overall security posture.

Example

Data Security Standard @. The PCI-DSS outlines a number of specific technical and organisational
measures that the payment card industry considers applicable whenever such data is being processed.

 

Although compliance with the PCI-DSS is not necessarily equivalent to compliance with the UK GDPR’s

security principle, if you process card data and suffer a personal data breach, the ICO will consider the
extent to which you have put in place measures that PCI-DSS requires particularly if the breach related
to a lack of a particular control or process mandated by the standard.

What do we do when a processor is involved?

If one or more organisations process personal data on your behalf, then these are data processors under
the UK GDPR. This can have the potential to cause security problems —- as a data controller you are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the UK GDPR and this includes what the processor does with the
data. However, in addition to this, the UK GDPR’s security requirements also apply to any processor you
use.

This means that:

@ you must choose a data processor that provides sufficient guarantees about its security measures;

@ your written contract must stipulate that the processor takes all measures required under Article 32 -
basically, the contract has to require the processor to undertake the same security measures that you
would have to take if you were doing the processing yourself; and

@ you should ensure that your contract includes a requirement that the processor makes available all
information necessary to demonstrate compliance. This may include allowing for you to audit and
inspect the processor, either yourself or an authorised third party.

At the same time, your processor can assist you in ensuring compliance with your security obligations. For
example, if you lack the resource or technical expertise to implement certain measures, engaging a
processor that has these resources can assist you in making sure personal data is processed securely,
provided that your contractual arrangements are appropriate.

Should we use pseudonymisation and encryption?

Pseudonymisation and encryption are specified in the UK GDPR as two examples of measures that may be
appropriate for you to implement. This does not mean that you are obliged to use these measures. It
depends on the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing, and the risks posed to individuals.

However, there are a wide range of solutions that allow you to implement both without great cost or
difficulty. For example, for a number of years the ICO has considered encryption to be an appropriate
technical measure given its widespread availability and relatively low cost of implementation. This position
has not altered due to the UK GDPR — if you are storing personal data, or transmitting it over the internet,
we recommend that you use encryption and have a suitable policy in place, taking account of the residual
risks involved.

When considering what to put in place, you should undertake a risk analysis and document your findings.

Detailed guidance on encryption

 

What are ‘confidentiality, integrity, availability’ and ‘resilience’?

Collectively known as the ‘CIA triad’, confidentiality, integrity and availability are the three key elements of
information security. If any of the three elements is compromised, then there can be serious consequences,
both for you as a data controller, and for the individuals whose data you process.

The information security measures you implement should seek to guarantee all three both for the systems
themselves and any data they process.

The CIA triad has existed for a number of years and its concepts are well-known to security professionals.

You are also required to have the ability to ensure the ‘resilience’ of your processing systems and services.
Resilience refers to:

676


--- New Page 238 ---
Page number: 238
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ whether your systems can continue operating under adverse conditions, such as those that may result
from a physical or technical incident; and

e your ability to restore them to an effective state.

This refers to things like business continuity plans, disaster recovery, and cyber resilience. Again, there is a
wide range of solutions available here, and what is appropriate for you depends on your circumstances.

Further Reading

Kr Relevant provisions in the UK GDPR - See Article 32(1)(b) and Recital 83 @

External link

What are the requirements for restoring availability and access to personal data?

You must have the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in the event of a physical or
technical incident in a ‘timely manner’.

The UK GDPR does not define what a ‘timely manner’ should be. This therefore depends on:

@ who you are;
@ what systems you have; and

e the risk that may be posed to individuals if the personal data you process is unavailable for a period of
time.

The key point is that you have taken this into account during your information risk assessment and
selection of security measures. For example, by ensuring that you have an appropriate backup process in
place you will have some level of assurance that if your systems do suffer a physical or technical incident
you can restore them, and therefore the personal data they hold, as soon as reasonably possible.

Example

An organisation takes regular backups of its systems and the personal data held within them. It follows
the well-known ‘3-2-1’ backup strategy: three copies, with two stored on different devices and one
stored off-site.

The organisation is targeted by a ransomware attack that results in the data being encrypted. This
means that it is no longer able to access the personal data it holds.

Depending on the nature of the organisation and the data it processes, this lack of availability can have
significant consequences on individuals - and would therefore be a personal data breach under the
UK GDPR.

The ransomware has spread throughout the organisation’s systems, meaning that two of the backups
are also unavailable. However, the third backup, being stored off-site, allows the organisation to restore
its systems in a timely manner. There may still be a loss of personal data depending on when the
off-site backup was taken, but having the ability to restore the systems means that whilst there will be

677

some disruption to the service, the organisation are nevertheless able to comply with this requirement
of the UK GDPR.

Are we required to ensure our security measures are effective?

Yes, the UK GDPR specifically requires you to have a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating
the effectiveness of any measures you put in place. What these tests look like, and how regularly you do
them, will depend on your own circumstances. However, it’s important to note that the requirement in the
UK GDPR concerns your measures in their entirety, therefore whatever ‘scope’ you choose for this testing
should be appropriate to what you are doing, how you are doing it, and the data that you are processing.

Technically, you can undertake this through a number of techniques, such as vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing. These are essentially ‘stress tests’ of your network and information systems, which are
designed to reveal areas of potential risk and things that you can improve.

In some industries, you are required to undertake tests of security measures on a regular basis. The UK
GDPR now makes this an obligation for all organisations. Importantly, it does not specify the type of
testing, nor how regularly you should undertake it. It depends on your organisation and the personal data
you are processing.

You can undertake testing internally or externally. In some cases it is recommended that both take place.

Whatever form of testing you undertake, you should document the results and make sure that you act upon
any recommendations, or have a valid reason for not doing so, and implement appropriate safeguards. This
is particularly important if your testing reveals potential critical flaws that could result in a personal data
breach.

What about codes of conduct and certification?

If your security measures include a product or service that adheres to a UK GDPR code of conduct or
certification scheme, you may be able to use this as an element to demonstrate your compliance with the
security principle. It is important that you check carefully that the code or certification scheme has been
approved by the ICO.

What about our staff?

The GDPR requires you to ensure that anyone acting under your authority with access to personal data
does not process that data unless you have instructed them to do so. It is therefore vital that your staff
understand the importance of protecting personal data, are familiar with your security policy and put its
procedures into practice.

You should provide appropriate initial and refresher training, including:

® your responsibilities as a data controller under the UK GDPR;

e staff responsibilities for protecting personal data — including the possibility that they may commit
criminal offences if they deliberately try to access or disclose these data without authority;

@ the proper procedures to identify callers;

e the dangers of people trying to obtain personal data by deception (eg by pretending to be the individual
whom the data concerns, or enabling staff to recognise ‘phishing’ attacks), or by persuading your staff
to alter information when they should not do so; and

@ any restrictions you place on the personal use of your systems by staff (eg to avoid virus infection or
spam).

Your staff training will only be effective if the individuals delivering it are themselves reliable and

knowledgeable.

What does the UK GDPR say about security?

The UK GDPR requires you to process personal data securely. Article 5(1)(f) concerns ‘integrity and
confidentiality’ of personal data - in short, it is the GDPR’s ‘security principle’. It states that personal data
shall be:

681


--- New Page 243 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures’

The aim of this guidance is to describe an overall set of outcomes that are considered ‘appropriate’ to
prevent personal data being accidentally or deliberately compromised.

@ Security

What are the other requirements?

Alongside the security principle, the UK GDPR contains other relevant requirements, including data
protection by design in Article 25 and security of processing in Article 32.

Data protection by design requires you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures
designed to implement the data protection principles effectively and integrate necessary safeguards into
the processing. You have to do this at the time of the determination of the means of the processing (ie the
design phase of any processing operation) and at the time of the processing itself.

You also have specific security obligations under Article 32 which apply whether you are a controller or a
processor. These require you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an
appropriate level of security of both the processing and your processing environment.

These provisions cover fundamental information security concepts including:

@ minimisation of personal data collected;
@ managing, limiting and controlling access to personal data;
® protecting the classic ‘CIA triad’ (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of personal data;

@ resilience of processing systems and services, and the ability to restore availability and access to
personal data; and

e@ regular testing of the effectiveness of measures implemented.

The measures you implement should be appropriate to the risk presented.

How does security relate to the UK GDPR’s accountability principle and our responsibility as
data controllers?

The accountability principle requires you to be able to demonstrate that your processing is done in
compliance with the UK GDPR. Accountability also has direct relevance to your responsibility as a data
controller.

You are required to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure, and be able to
demonstrate, that processing of personal data is performed in accordance with the UK GDPR.

e Accountability and governance

What are ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’?

The UK GDPR requires you to have a level of security that is ‘appropriate’ to the risks presented by your
processing. You need to consider this in relation to the state of the art and costs of implementation, as well
as the nature, scope, context and purpose of your processing. This reflects both the UK GDPR’s risk-based
approach, and that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to information security.

This means that what’s ‘appropriate’ for you will depend on your own circumstances, the processing you’re
doing, and the risks it presents to your organisation.

This guidance sets out a set of security outcomes that could form the basis of describing ‘appropriate
technical and organisational measures’ to protect personal data. Whilst there are minimum expectations,
the precise implementation of any measures must be appropriate to the risks you face.

Why ‘security outcomes’?

It may seem like there is a lot of confusion as to the technical security required to comply with your data
protection obligations. There is lots of detailed guidance available, but it may not be immediately clear what
you must put in place, what is simply a suggested approach and what is relevant to you and your
circumstances.

The outcomes intend to provide a common set of expectations that you can meet, either through following
existing guidance, using particular services or, if you are sufficiently competent, development of your own
bespoke approach.

An outcomes-based approach also enables scaling to any size or complexity of organisation or data
processing operation. The outcomes remain constant — it is how they are implemented that differs.

A.2 Risk management

You take appropriate steps to identify, assess and understand security risks to personal data and the
systems that process this data.

The UK GDPR emphasises a risk-based approach to data protection and the security of your processing
systems and services. You must take steps to assess these risks and include appropriate organisational
measures to make effective risk-based decisions based upon:

@ the state of the art (of technology);

@ the cost of implementation;

e the nature, scope, context and purpose of processing; and

e@ the severity and likelihood of the risk(s).

Beyond this, where the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals,
you must also undertake a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to determine the impact of the
intended processing on the protection of personal data. The DPIA should consider the technical and
organisational measures necessary to mitigate that risk. Where such measures do not reduce the risk to an

acceptable level, you need to have a process in place to consult with the ICO before you start the
processing.

Steps to Cyber Security is about developing an information risk management regime.

A.3 Asset management

You understand and catalogue the personal data you process and can describe the purpose for processing
it. You also understand the risks posed to individuals of any unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental
loss, destruction or damage to that data.

The personal data you process should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the
purpose of the processing, and it should not be kept for longer than is necessary.

A.4 Processors and the supply chain

You understand and manage security risks to your processing operations that may arise as a result of using
third parties such as data processors. This includes ensuring that they employ appropriate security
measures.

In the case of data processors, you are required to choose those that provide sufficient guarantees about
their technical and organisational measures. The UK GDPR includes provisions where processors are used,
including specific stipulations that must feature in your contract.

B. Protect personal data against cyber-attack
You have proportionate security measures in place to protect against cyber-attack which cover:

e@ the personal data you process; and

@ the systems that process such data.
B.1 Service protection policies and processes

You should define, implement, communicate and enforce appropriate policies and processes that direct your
overall approach to securing systems involved in the processing of personal data.

You should also consider assessing your systems and implementing specific technical controls as laid out in
appropriate frameworks (such as Cyber Essentials).
Other resources

Homepage of the Cyber Essentials schemes at the NCSC’s website.

 

B.2 Identity and access control

You understand, document and manage access to personal data and systems that process this data. Access
rights granted to specific users must be understood, limited to those users who reasonably need such
access to perform their function and removed when no longer needed. You should undertake activities to
check or validate that the technical system permissions are consistent with your documented user access
rights.

You should appropriately authenticate and authorise users (or any automated functions) that can access
personal data. You should strongly authenticate users who have privileged access and consider two-factor
or hardware authentication measures.

You should prevent users from downloading, transferring, altering or deleting personal data where there is
no legitimate organisational reason to do so. You should appropriately constrain legitimate access and
ensure there is an appropriate audit trail.

You should have a robust password policy which avoids users having weak passwords, such as those
trivially guessable. You should change all default passwords and remove or suspend unused accounts.

B.3 Data security

You implement technical controls (such as appropriate encryption) to prevent unauthorised or unlawful
processing of personal data, whether through unauthorised access to user devices or storage media,
backups, interception of data in transit or at rest or accessing data that might remain in memory when
technology is sent for repair or disposal.

B.4 System security

You implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect systems, technologies and
digital services that process personal data from cyber-attack.

Whilst the UK GDPR requires a risk-based approach, typical examples of security measures you could take

688

include:
® tracking and recording all assets that process personal data, including end user devices and removable
media;

®@ minimising the opportunity for attack by configuring technology appropriately, minimising available
services and controlling connectivity;

® actively managing software vulnerabilities, including using in-support software and the application of
software update policies (patching), and taking other mitigating steps, where patches can’t be applied;

@ managing end user devices (laptops and smartphones etc.) so that you can apply organisational controls
over software or applications that interact with or access personal data;

® encrypting personal data at rest on devices (laptops, smartphones, removable media) that are not
subject to strong physical controls;

® encrypting personal data when transmitted electronically;

@ ensuring that web services are protected from common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and
others described in widely-used publications such as the OWASP Top 10; and

® ensuring your processing environment remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

You also undertake regular testing to evaluate the effectiveness of your security measures, including virus
and malware scanning, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing as appropriate. You record the results
of any testing and remediating action plans.

Whatever security measures you put in place - whether these are your own, or whether you use a third
party service such as a cloud provider - you remain responsible both for the processing itself, and also in
respect of any devices that you operate.

Passwords in online services

At a glance

e Although the UK GDPR does not say anything specific about passwords, you are required to process
personal data securely by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures.

e Passwords are a commonly-used means of protecting access to systems that process personal data.
Therefore, any password setup that you implement must be appropriate to the particular circumstances
of this processing.

@ You should consider whether there are any better alternatives to using passwords.

e Any password system you deploy must protect against theft of stored passwords and ‘brute-force’ or
guessing attacks.

e@ There are a number of additional considerations you will need to take account of when designing your
password system, such as the use of an appropriate hashing algorithm to store your passwords,
protecting the means by which users enter their passwords, defending against common attacks and the
use of two-factor authentication.

In brief

What is this guidance about?

This guidance is intended for use when you want to implement a password-based authentication scheme
for an online service. It outlines the considerations that you should have where your authentication scheme
will be protecting access to personal data.

Using passwords or other credentials for your internal network and information systems are out of scope of
this guidance. However, there may be content that applies in this context all the same.

693


--- New Page 255 ---
Page number: 255
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Before reading and applying this guidance, you should consider whether passwords are the most
appropriate method of authenticating users, or whether other alternatives will provide more security and
less friction for users.

What is required under the UK GDPR?

The UK GDPR does not say anything specific about passwords. However, Article 5(1)(f) states that personal
data shall be:

66

‘Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures’

This is the UK GDPR’s ‘integrity and confidentiality’ principle, or, more simply, the ‘security’ principle. So,
although there are no provisions on passwords, the security principle requires you to take appropriate
technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised processing of personal data you hold.

This means that when you are considering a password setup to protect access to a system that processes
personal data, that setup must be ‘appropriate’.

Although the UK GDPR does not define what is ‘appropriate’, it does provide further considerations in Article
32, ‘security of processing’:

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.’

This means that when considering any measures, you can consider the state of technological development
and the cost of implementation - but the measures themselves must ensure a level of security appropriate
to the nature of the data being protected and the harm that could be caused by unauthorised access.

In other words, you cannot simply set up a password system and then forget about it —- there must be a
periodic review process.

What else do we need to do?

You must ensure that you are aware of the state of technological development in this area and that your
processes and technologies are robust against evolving threats.

For example, advances in processing power can reduce the effectiveness of cryptography or particular

694


--- New Page 256 ---
Page number: 256
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

design choices can become outdated.

You must also consider whether there might be better alternatives to passwords that can be used to secure
a system.

Article 25 of the UK GDPR also requires you to adopt a data protection by design approach. This means that
whenever you develop systems and services that are involved in your processing, you should ensure that
you take account of data protection considerations at the initial design stage and throughout the lifecycle.
This applies to any password system you intend to use.

At the same time, provided you properly implement a password system, it can be an element that can be
used to demonstrate compliance with your obligations under data protection by design.

What are the challenges in choosing the right authentication scheme?

One of the biggest challenges you face when dealing with personal data online is ensuring that such data
can be accessed only by those with the correct permissions - in other words, authenticating, and
authorising, the individual who is trying to gain access.

It is commonly accepted that there are three main ways of authenticating people to a system —- checking
for:

@ something the individual has (such as a smart card);
@ something the individual is (this is usually a biometric measure, such as a fingerprint); or

@ something the individual knows.

Of these, the most commonly used is something the individual knows. In most cases something they know
is taken to be a password.

Passwords remain the most popular way that individuals authenticate to online services. The reason for this
is that a password is generally the simplest method to deploy and the most familiar for individuals.

Despite this, passwords carry well-known risks. The biggest risk is that people passwords as a
mathematical problem that can be solved by increasing complexity rules. This fails to take into account

695


--- New Page 257 ---
Page number: 257
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

natural human behaviour which is to make passwords more easily memorable, regardless of the cost to
security.

A rigid focus on password strength rules with no consideration of the usual behaviour of people choosing
passwords means that you can make inappropriate choices in setting up and maintaining of your
authentication system. This could place the wider security of your systems or your users at risk, and could
lead to unauthorised or unlawful access to personal data.

Are passwords the best choice?

The success of using a password to properly authenticate a user of your service relies on the fact that their
password remains a shared secret between you and them. When a password is shared amongst users or
can be easily guessed by an attacker it can become extremely difficult to tell the difference between an
authorised user and an imposter with stolen or guessed credentials.

The proliferation of online services requiring individuals to create an account has created a risk that people
become overwhelmed with access credentials and default to reusing a short and memorable password
(often coupled with the same email address as a username) across multiple websites.

The risk here is that if one service suffers a personal data breach and access credentials are compromised,
these can be tested against other online services to gain access — a technique known as ‘credential
stuffing’.

Example

In 2012, the social networking site LinkedIn was hacked. It was thought at the time that passwords for
around 6.5 million user accounts were stolen by cybercriminals. However, in May 2016, following the
confirmed that the 2012 attack had actually resulted in the theft of email addresses and hashed
passwords of approximately 165 million users @.

 

 

The vast majority of the passwords were subsequently cracked and posted online less than a day after
the further distribution, largely due to the use of SHA1 without a salt as the hashing algorithm. Due to
the reuse of passwords across online services, a number of subsequent account takeovers at other
services were attributed to the LinkedIn hack.

Before designing and implementing a new password system, you should consider whether it is necessary to
do so, or whether there is a better alternative that can provide secure access.

One common alternative to building your own solution is to utilise a single sign on (SSO) system. While this
has its advantages (not least a reduction in the number of passwords that a user has to remember) you
must ensure that you are happy with the level of security that is offered by that system. You should ensure
that you have a documented record of the considerations you made when reaching this decision.

You must also consider what will happen if the SSO is compromised, as this will most likely result in your
user’s accounts also being compromised.

696

What makes a secure and useable password system?

A good password system is one that provides you with sufficient assurance that the individual attempting to
log in is the user they claim to be. In practice, this means a good password system should protect against
two types of attack:

e firstly, it should be as difficult as possible for attackers to access stored passwords in a useable form;
and

@ secondly, it should protect against attackers trying to brute force or guess a valid password and
username combination.

Your system should also make it as easy as possible for users to create secure and unique passwords that
they can remember or store easily. It should not place an undue burden on individuals to make sure that
their account is secure. Putting such barriers in place can result in users making less secure password
choices.

The advice provided in this guidance is a good starting point for most systems where personal data is being
protected. It will be updated as necessary, but you should consider whether you need to apply a higher
level of security given your particular circumstances.

This will largely depend on the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing and the risks it
poses. However, in essence, the more serious the consequences of a compromise, the higher the level of
security that you will require.

You should ensure that you stay up to date with the current capabilities of attackers who might try to

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you are going to put in place a password system, you should take account of factors like:

@ how you will process user passwords;

e@ how your users enter their passwords;

e the requirements you set for user passwords;

@ what you do about password expirations and resets;
e the defences you put in place against attacks; and

@ any additional considerations.

How should we store passwords?

Do not store passwords in plaintext - make sure you use a suitable hashing algorithm, or another
mechanism that offers an equivalent level of protection against an attacker deriving the original password.

Well-known hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA1 are not suitable for hashing passwords. Both
algorithms have known security weaknesses which can be exploited, and you should not use these for
password protection in any circumstances. The biggest weakness with these algorithms is the speed that
hashes can be calculated.

You should also consider avoiding other fast algorithms. Use a hashing algorithm that has been specifically
designed for passwords, such as bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2, with a salt of appropriate length.

It is important that you review the hashing algorithms you use, as over time they can become outdated.
Guidance on algorithms is available from a number of organisations such as the NCSC @, the National
Institute of Standards in Technology @ (NIST) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity @
(ENISA). You should also be aware of any sector-specific guidelines that are available and may be
applicable to you.

 

 

 

You should make sure that you can replace any algorithm that becomes obsolete.

You should also ensure that the architecture around your password system does not allow for any
inadvertent leaking of passwords in plaintext.

Example

In 2018, Twitter and GitHub discovered that errors in their logging systems had led to plaintext
passwords for users being stored in log files. Although the log files were not exposed to anyone outside
of the organisations, both Twitter and GitHub recommended or required that users changed their
passwords.

ECRYPT-CSA’s 2018 ‘Algorithms, key size and protocols @’ report (external link, PDF) provides further
information on the status of cryptographic hash functions.

 

How should our users enter their passwords?

You should ensure that your login pages are protected with HTTPS, or some other equivalent level of
protection. Failure to do so will mean that anyone who is in a position to intercept network traffic can obtain
passwords and may be able to carry out replay attacks. You should also consider that browsers now mark
pages that require secure input (such as login pages) as insecure if they are delivered over HTTP, and many
browsers now mark all pages delivered over HTTP as insecure.

Further reading

Make sure that password hashing is carried out server-side, rather than client-side. Hashing client-side will
remove the protection afforded by hashing in the first place, unless other mitigations are put in place. This
is a complicated area with a number of factors to consider. At the most basic level, if you are hashing
client-side and an attacker obtains your password database, then those hashes can be presented directly to
the server for a successful login.

Also, you should not prevent users from pasting passwords into the password field. Preventing pasting is
often seen as a security measure, but at the same time doing so can impede people from using password

defended against with proper rate limiting (see below for more details on rate limiting).

 

Other resources

Read the NCSC’s ‘Let them paste passwords’ @ blog post for more information on why you should allow
your users to paste passwords into password fields.

 

What requirements should we set for user passwords?

There are three general requirements for any password system that you will need to consider:

® password length - you should set a suitable minimum password length (this should be no less than 10
characters), but not a maximum length. If you are correctly hashing your passwords, then the output

699


--- New Page 261 ---
Page number: 261
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

should be the same length for every password, and therefore the only limit to password length should
be the way your website is coded. If you absolutely must set a maximum length due to the limitations of
your website code, then tell users what it is before they try to enter a password. The reasoning behind
having a maximum length should be documented and fully risk assessed;

@ special characters - you should allow the use of special characters, but don’t mandate it. If you must
disallow special characters (or spaces) make sure this is made clear before the user creates their
password; and

® password ‘deny lists’ - do not allow your users to use a common, weak password. Screen passwords
against a password ‘deny list’ of the most commonly used passwords, leaked passwords from website
breaches and common words or phrases that relate to the service. Update this list at least yearly.
Explain to users that this is what you are doing, and that this is why a password has been rejected.

Example

 

Other than the three requirements listed above, do not set restrictions on how users should create a
password. Research (see ‘Other resources’ below) indicates that doing so will cause people to reuse
passwords across accounts, to create weak passwords with obvious substitutions or to forget their
passwords. All this places unnecessary stress on your reset process and weakens the overall security of
your service.

Properly set up and configured password strength meters can be a good way to easily communicate the
requirements listed above to your users, and research has shown that good meters can assist users in
choosing strong passwords. If you decide to use one, make sure it properly reflects what constitutes a
strong or weak password.

number of common password attacks and highlights a number of issues including the risks of placing
restrictions on how users create passwords.

A password ‘deny list’ could be a feature of the software you use. Other lists are available online, e.g.
SecLists @ and haveibeenpwned's @ password list.

well as the significant amount of research @ (external link) from Carnegie Mellon University.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Finally, remind your users that they should not reuse passwords from other services. In most circumstances
you should not know what your user’s passwords are. However, some companies actively track
compromised credentials that are traded on the dark web and will check these credentials against the
hashes they hold on their systems to see if there is a match.

If you decide that this is something you want to do you need to carefully consider the potential legal
implications of obtaining such lists, and you will need to explain very clearly how you use that data to your
users (especially where the use of such data has led to a password reset or an account lockout).

If users receive an email asking them to reset their password without a proper explanation they will
generally assume that the problem is with your service, so it is in your interests to explain precisely why
you are taking this action.

What should we do about password expirations and resets?

You should only set password expirations if they are absolutely necessary for your particular circumstances.
Regular expiry often causes people to change a single strong password for a series of weak passwords.

As a general rule, get your users to create a strong initial password and only change them if there are
pressing reasons, such as a breach of your systems that may have resulted in the password hashes being
compromised, or if you receive some other indication that a user’s password may have been compromised.

When deploying a password reset process you should ensure that it is secure. Do not send passwords over
email, even if they are temporary — use one time links, and ensure that you do not leak the credentials in
any referral headers.

You should also not be in a position where a member of your staff is able to ‘read out’ a user’s password to
them, eg over the phone in a service call—this indicates that you are storing passwords in plaintext, which
is, as described above, not appropriate. If you require a password to validate a user over the phone, set a

separate phone password for the account.

You should also time limit any password reset credentials. The majority of users will probably reset their
password immediately, but set a limit that fits your observed user behaviour.
Other resources

Read the FTC’s advice about the potential issues with mandatory password changes @ from 2016
(external link).

 

What defences can we put in place against attacks?

Ensure that you are rate limiting or ‘throttling’ the number and frequency of incorrect login attempts. The
precise number of attempts and the consequence of exceeding these limits will be for you to decide based
on the specific circumstances of your organisation, but limiting to a certain number per hour, day and
month is a good idea.

This will help to deter both bulk attackers and people targeting individual accounts.

701


--- New Page 263 ---
Page number: 263
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

failed attempts on a single account unless otherwise specified in the system being deployed.

There are additional considerations when implementing your rate limits:

@ you should be aware that some attackers will deliberately work within your limits to avoid detection, and
will still achieve a reasonable success rate, especially with targeted guessing;

e@ set your limits based on observed behaviour of both attackers and your users;

@ be aware that overly-aggressive rate limiting can be used as a denial of service attack (remember that
the UK GDPR requires the availability of personal data); and

@ remember that a number of successful or unsuccessful access attempts to a range of different user
accounts from the same device or IP address might be indicative of a bulk attack.

You should also consider whether other methods of preventing attacks might be appropriate. Examples of
these methods could include, but are not limited to:

@ the use of ‘CAPTCHAs’;
@ creating an ‘allow list’ of IP addresses; and

@ time limits or time delays after failed authentications.

What else do we need to consider?

You need to address how your system will respond to an attacker who has legitimate credentials for a user,
or for multiple users. There is a distinct possibility that you will encounter this scenario given that both
password reuse and website breaches are relatively common occurrences.

Techniques for recognising common user behaviour are becoming more advanced, and you could use these
to develop a risk-based approach to verifying an authentication attempt. For example, if a user logs in from
a new device or IP address you might consider requesting a second authentication factor and informing the
user by another contact method of the login attempt.

It is however important to remember that collecting additional data from users in order to defend against
authentication attacks could itself constitute processing personal data and should operate in compliance
with the UK GDPR. This does not mean you cannot process this data, but you must ensure that you have
considered the data protection implications of doing so.

You should consider providing your users with the facility to review a list of unsuccessful login attempts.
This will allow people who might be specifically targeted to check for potential attacks manually. However,
this will only be useful if you pay attention to reports from individuals that their accounts are being
attacked.

You should implement two-factor or multifactor authentication wherever it is possible to do so - to take the
most common example, a password and a one-time token generator. This will be more important where the

7062


--- New Page 264 ---
Page number: 264
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

personal data that can be accessed is of a sensitive nature, or could cause significant harm if it were
compromised.

Other examples of a second factor that could be used include biometrics (fingerprints being the most
common and easy to implement), smart cards or U2F keys and devices.

You will however need to ensure that any processing of biometric data for the purposes of uniquely
identifying an individual is done in accordance with the requirements for processing special category data in
both the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

Ransomware and data protection compliance

At a glance

@ Personal data breaches from the ICO’s caseload during 2020/2021 have seen a steady increase in the
number and severity caused by ransomware. This is a type of malicious software or “malware” designed
to block access to computer systems, and the data held within them, using encryption.

@ Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to unlawfully encrypt files on a host computer system.

@ This guidance presents eight scenarios about the most common ransomware compliance issues we have
seen.

What is ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to unlawfully encrypt files on a host computer system.

705


--- New Page 267 ---
Page number: 267
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

A ransomware attack occurs when an attacker gains access to an organisation’s computer systems and
delivers malicious software into the network. This software, or ‘payload,’ then makes the data unavailable
through encryption or deletion. Ransomware is often designed to spread from device to device to maximise
the number of files it can encrypt.

The ‘ransom’ element comes from the ransom note left by the attacker requesting payment in return for
restoring the data. This is usually done by a decryption key that only the attacker can access.

Where personal data is encrypted as the result of a ransomware attack, that constitutes a personal data
breach because you have lost timely access to the data.

Unless you have a backup of the data, you will not usually be able to recover it unless you decide to comply
with the attacker’s demand for payment. Even if you decide to pay the ransom fee, there is no guarantee
that the attacker will supply the key to allow you to decrypt the files.

Why is ransomware an important data protection topic?

In recent years, ransomware attacks are one of the most common cyber incidents affecting personal data.
The attack can lead to the loss of timely access to personal data. Permanent data loss can also occur, if
appropriate backups are not in place.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recognises ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the
United Kingdom. The most recent threat landscape report from the European Union Agency for Cyber
Security (ENISA) has also assessed ransomware as the prime threat with cybercriminals increasingly
motivated by monetisation.

The attacks are becoming increasingly damaging and this trend is likely to continue. Malicious and criminal
actors are finding new ways to pressure organisations to pay. For example, through uploading a copy of
your data and threatening to publish it.

As criminal actors look for additional ways to exploit the captured data, the risks to individuals have
increased, including:

@ potential permanent personal data loss;

@ potential loss of control over their personal data;

@ being further targeted in social engineering style attacks using the breached data (eg phishing emails);
and

e@ their personal data being further maliciously used by criminal actors (eg to facilitate identify and
financial fraud).

Sectors such as education, health, legal services and business are amongst the most targeted. However, all
UK businesses that process personal data are at risk. This is due to the low barriers to entry, such as by
using ransomware-as-a-service and opportunistic attacks.

What can we do to prevent ransomware?

You should review our checklist above, as well as the following eight scenarios. These are the eight most
common ransomware compliance issues we have identified, based on past personal data breaches.

706

Scenario 1: Attacker sophistication

I am a small organisation that is aware of the growing threat of ransomware. However, I don’t think
attackers will be interested in targeting me. If they do, how can I protect the personal data I process?

‘Scatter gun’ style attacks are a common attack method. This is a type of attack that is indiscriminate and
does not have a specific target. For example, the attacker may send thousands of phishing emails
attempting to deliver ransomware to at least one victim, whoever that may be.

The NCSC Cyber Essentials @ is designed to support you in preventing basic and common types of attacks.
The measures they describe will help you apply appropriate security measures, which are a requirement of
the UK GDPR.

 

For medium and larger organisations, maintaining good cyber security practices is essential to defend
against ransomware attacks. Assessing your cyber security arrangements and capabilities against relevant
good practice models can support you protect personal data from the threat of ransomware, such as:

@ NCSC 10 Steps to Cyber Security; @
@ 1SO27001 for Information Security @; and
@ NIST Cyber Security Framework @.

The NCSC Mitigating Malware and Ransomware attacks @ also provides specific guidance that can support
you in preventing such attacks.

 

Scenario 2: Personal data breach

We have been subjected to a ransomware attack, but personal data has not been uploaded from our
systems to the attacker. If the data has not been removed does this mean a personal data breach has
not occurred?

If you are subject to a cyber-attack, such as ransomware, you are responsible for determining if the
incident has led to a personal data breach. This is your first step in deciding if you should notify the ICO
about the incident.

The UK GDPR defines a personal data breach as “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or
otherwise processed”.

Where personal data is taken it typically results in unauthorised disclosure or access to personal data and
therefore is a type of personal data breach. However, it is not the only consideration you should make when
determining if a personal data breach has occurred.

707


--- New Page 269 ---
Page number: 269
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You may have lost timely access to the personal data, for example because the data has been encrypted.
This is a type of personal data breach because you have lost “access to” personal data. Temporary loss of
access is also a type of personal data breach. For example, if there is a period of time before you restore
from backup.

Therefore, loss of access to personal data is as much of a personal data breach as a loss of confidentiality.

However, just because a personal data breach has occurred does not automatically mean you should notify
the ICO. Scenario 3 deals with a common breach notification scenario.

Scenario 3: Breach notification

We have established a personal data breach has occurred, but data has not been exfiltrated, therefore
there are no risk to individuals. Do we still need to notify the ICO?

You are required to notify the ICO of a personal data breach without undue delay and no later than 72
hours after having become aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and
freedoms of individuals.

This means once you have established a personal data breach has occurred, you should undertake a formal
risk assessment. This is to determine the risks to individuals and the likelihood of such risks occurring. If
you determine the risks to be unlikely, you do not need to notify the ICO. However, you must keep a record
of any personal data breaches, regardless of whether you are required to notify, together with the risk
assessment undertaken.

Where data is uploaded from your systems to the attacker it can increase the risks to individuals.

Therefore, you should take data exfiltration into account as part of your risk considerations. Appropriate
logging can support you in determining if personal data is likely to have been exfiltrated. The NCSC blog
post “What exactly should we be logging @” can support you in deciding what logs to collect and retain.

 

Without appropriate logs you may not generate the evidence to allow you to make an informed decision. If
you determine there is no evidence of data exfiltration, the ICO may ask you to demonstrate what logs and
measures you used to make this decision.

However, whilst exfiltration is an important consideration it is not the only one you should make. You should
consider the rights and freedoms of individuals in totality. For example:

@ Does the lack of availability impact on any individual rights, such as right of access to the personal data?
@ Have individuals lost control of their personal data?

@ Can you restore the personal data in a timely manner? If not, what does this mean for individuals?

e To what degree was the personal data exposed to unauthorised actors and what are their likely
motivations?

@ How confident are you in your detection and monitoring controls —- could you have detected personal
data being uploaded if it had occurred? If you do not have appropriate logs to make an informed
decision, it may be helpful to determine if the attacker had the means, motivation and opportunity to

708


--- New Page 270 ---
Page number: 270
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

exfiltrate the data. You can then use this assessment to make a risk-based decision.

Further reading

The ICO’s Personal data breach assessment tool can support you in identifying reportable personal data
breaches.

 

Our guidance on personal data breaches can also further support you in assessing reportable personal
data breaches.

 

Scenario 4: Law enforcement

A ransomware attack has breached the personal data we process. We are planning to notify individuals,
however, law enforcement are currently collecting evidence as this was a criminal attack. They have
requested we delay notifying individuals until they has completed this. How do I comply with my GDPR
obligations whilst also cooperating with law enforcement?

If you have been subjected to a ransomware attack it is recommended you should contact law
enforcement.

Law enforcement play a fundamental role in protecting individuals and the ICO work closely with these
agencies in providing a multi-agency response to ransomware. Recitals 86 and 88 of the UK GDPR provide
direction should law enforcement recommend delaying data subject notification:

Recital 86:

Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close
cooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant
authorities such as law-enforcement authorities

Recital 88:

Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of
law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the
circumstances of a personal data breach

709


--- New Page 271 ---
Page number: 271
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

However, law enforcement involvement does not automatically mean you should delay notifying individuals.
Should law enforcement request a delay in a public notification, you should work closely with the ICO. This
will allow us to work with you and law enforcement to assess the risk to the individuals under respective
legislation.

Scenario 5: Attacker tactics, techniques and procedures

We have recently seen an increase in phishing emails coming into our organisation and are looking at
what measures we can put in place to mitigate this risk. Are there any other specific attacker tactics
that the ICO commonly see in ransomware attacks?

Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) describe the methods attackers use to compromise data.
Different attacks will use different types of TTPs, for example phishing is a common TTP to trick someone
into giving up their credentials.

However, attacker TTPs are constantly evolving, as described within scenario one of this report. A good
baseline of controls will reduce the likelihood of being exploited by basic levels of attack, such as those
described in the NCSC Cyber Essentials.

world observations. The framework outlines each stage of an attack and the common TTPs that are used.
These are a great resource to support you in identifying if your controls are appropriate to resist known
TTPs.

During 2020/2021, we identified four of the most common TTPs from ransomware casework. The following
practical advice for each example will support you in implementing appropriate measures.

Phishing: Attackers typically use social engineering techniques to trick you into doing something. Phishing
is a common method we've seen to either deliver ransomware by email or to trick you into revealing your
username and password.

Your security strategy should include ensuring all relevant staff receive basic awareness training in

Phishing Attack guidance to your own organisation.

 

Remote access: The most common entry point into a network was by the exploitation of remote access
solutions. Attackers often scan the internet for open ports such as remote desktop protocol and use this as
an initial entry point. If they can capture valid credentials (eg by phishing, password database dumps or
password guessing through brute force), they can authenticate by the remote access solution.

You should risk assess and document your remote access solution and identify appropriate measures in
response to the risks. An access control policy that directs you to the minimum levels of controls required
will support you in applying appropriate measures.

You should not use single-factor authentication on internet facing services, such as remote access, if it can
lead to access to personal data. Use multi-factor authentication, or other comparably secure access

718


--- New Page 272 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

controls.

The NCSC device security guidance @ provides further advice on designing a remote access architecture for
enterprise services.

 

Privileged account compromise: Once an attacker has a foothold in the network it is common that they
compromise a privileged account, such as a domain administrator account. This is typically done by either

® compromising weak passwords of privileged accounts;
® compromising service accounts that do not belong to a particular user;

@ using well known tools to extract plain text domain administrator passwords, password hashes or
Kerberos tickets from the host; or

@ exploiting a known software or application vulnerability which has a patch available to fix it.

Once an attacker can elevate their privileges to a domain administrative level account they are typically in a
commanding position and will usually deploy the ransomware through the domain controller.

The security of privileged accounts should be a high priority for you. Basic account hygiene can support you
in protecting these accounts, such as:

@ regular reviews of permissions;
@ following the principle of least privilege;
e@ risk assessments of membership into privileged groups; and

@ senior level approval of privileged group membership.

Further reading

The NCSC has a selection of guidance available that can further support you in identifying appropriate
measures to protect privileged accounts.

e How to do secure system administration @

® Protecting system administration with PAM @

Known software or application vulnerabilities: The exploitation of known vulnerabilities where patches
were available to fix the issue is a common method used by attackers. This was much more common than
zero-day attacks where the vulnerability exploited is not yet publicly known and is typically crafted by
advanced levels of attackers. In particular, attackers often scan, sometimes indiscriminately, for known
vulnerabilities present in internet-facing device and services.

The NCSC vulnerability management guidance @ will support you in managing vulnerabilities within your
estate.

 

Considering the following will also support you in managing known vulnerabilities:

e@ Identify the assets within your organisation, including the software and application you use.

@ Define and direct your approach to the patch management lifecycle, including the process of identifying,
assessing, acquiring, testing, deploying and validating patches.

e@ Maintain software and applications that are in support by the vendor.

711


--- New Page 273 ---
Page number: 273
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ Identify vulnerabilities within your estate for both internal and external hardware and software (eg
vulnerability scanning).

Scenario 6: Disaster recovery

We understand the UK GDPR requires appropriate controls to be able to restore personal data in the
event of a disaster. We currently backup our data so we are able to restore it in the event of a
ransomware attack. Is there anything else we should consider?

A ransomware attack can be amongst the most stressful times for an organisation. Planning for such an
event is critical in ensuring you have the measures in place to be able to appropriately respond to it.

For smaller and medium sized organisations the NCSC Small Business Guide Response and Recovery @
gives you practical advice that will help you plan for dealing with an incident such as a ransomware attack.

 

For larger organisations the NCSC Incident Management guidance within its 10 steps to cyber security @
can support you in implementing appropriate controls.

 

A backup of your personal data is one of the most important controls in mitigating the risk of ransomware.
However, it is common that attackers will attempt to either delete or encrypt your backup. You should
therefore consider if your current backup strategy could be at risk. Performing a threat analysis against
your backup solution and considering how an attacker could delete or encrypt the data is recommended.
The questions below will help you get started in your threat assessment:

e@ Is your backup segregated or offline?

@ What would an attacker need to compromise to gain access to the backup? For example, what accounts
can access the backup? What accounts can perform deletion or edit the backups? How could an attacker
compromise these accounts? How do you protect accounts that can access the backups?

@ Are you able to detect changes to your backup? For example, if an attacker initiated a deletion of your
backup, could you detect this?

@ What device or IP address or both can access the backup repository? Can this be spoofed? Can an
attacker access the device or repository that stores the backup?

@ How would you respond if an attacker deleted or encrypted your backup?

Using your threat analyses will help you identify controls to mitigate the risks. Offline backups that are
completely offline from the main network are one of the most secure ways to prevent attackers from
accessing it. If you are using cloud backups, you should read the NCSC blog posts about protecting these
backups Offline Backups in on online world @ and Cloud Backup options for mitigating the risk of
ransomware @.

 

 

Scenario 7: Ransomware payment

712


--- New Page 274 ---
Page number: 274
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The attacker has provided a ransomware note saying it can restore the data if we pay the ransom fee.
The attacker has also stated that if we pay they will not publish the data, so we are also considering if
this would further reduce risk to individuals.

Does the ICO recommend the payment of the ransom to restore the data and mitigate risks to
individuals?

Before paying the ransom, you should take into account that you are dealing with criminal and malicious
actors. Even if you pay, there is no guarantee that they will provide you with the decryption key. “Double
extortion” is also common, where you pay for the decryption key and the attacker then requires an
additional payment to stop the publication of the data. Attack groups may also target you again in the
future if you have shown willingness to pay.

Law enforcement do not encourage, endorse, nor condone the payment of ransom demands. The ICO
supports this position.

You should also consider the terminology within the UK GDPR. It requires you to implement “appropriate
measures” to restore the data in the event of a disaster. The ICO does not consider the payment of a
ransom as an “appropriate measure” to restore personal data.

Appropriate measures include threat assessments, risk assessments and controls such as offline and
segregated backups. If you can demonstrate appropriate measures in accordance with the state of the art,
cost and risk of processing then you will be able to demonstrate “appropriate measures” and comply with
those aspects of the UK GDPR.

If attackers have exfiltrated the personal data, then you have effectively lost control over that data. This
means individuals have lost the protections and rights provided by the UK GDPR. For example,
transparency of processing or subject access rights. For this reason, we do not view the payment of the
ransom as an effective mitigation measure.

If you do decide to pay the ransom to avoid the data being published, you should still presume that the
data is compromised and take actions accordingly. For example, the attacker may still decide to publish the
data, share the data offline with other attack groups or further exploit it for their own gains. You still need
to consider how you will mitigate the risks to individuals even though you have paid the ransom fee.

Scenario 8: Testing and assessing security controls

I want to protect my organisation and the personal data I process from ransomware. Is there any type
of testing I can do to assess whether my controls are appropriate?

The UK GDPR requires you to regularly test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of your technical and
organisational controls using appropriate measures. There is no one test that you can carry out, you should
consider this within your wider security framework.

For the examples discussed within this review, we have provided several suggested methods which will

713


--- New Page 275 ---
Page number: 275
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

support you in adopting appropriate measures:

e Breach notification: Document and perform regular tests of your incident response plan so you are
prepared for a real incident. The NCSC Exercise in a Box @ tool can help you practice your incident
response in a safe environment.

e Account management: Regularly audit your user accounts to ensure they are still required and
contain the appropriate privileges. This should include reviews to ensure staff have not retained
privileges from previous internal job roles that are no longer required, often called “privilege creep”.
Ensure you document such reviews. Consider controls to identify weak or previously breached
passwords.

e Patch management: Have a method to identify vulnerabilities in your network, such as missing
patches. Vulnerability scans are an effective tool that can support this.

e Attack tactics, techniques and procedure: Risk assess and document your security controls to
determine if they are appropriate to resist known TTPs. Penetration testers often simulate attacker
activity by applying TTPs to vulnerabilities within your environment.

e Audit: Perform and record regular audits of your environment against a proven security standard, such
as Cyber essentials (for smaller organisations) or IS027001 (for medium and larger organisations).

e Disaster recovery: Perform and record regular tests of your disaster recovery plan to ensure it is
effective. For example, perform a restore of personal data to ensure the data can be restored within the
recovery time objective.

As with any tests, reviews, and assessments, ensure you document and appropriately retain these records,
as you may need to submit them to the ICO.

e@ Encryption scenarios

e@ In detail

What does the UK GDPR say about encryption?

e The UK GDPR’s security principle requires to you put in place appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure you process personal data securely.

@ Article 32 provides further considerations for the security of your processing. This includes specifying
encryption as an example of an appropriate technical measure, depending on the risks involved and the
specific circumstances of your processing. The ICO has seen numerous incidents of personal data being
subject to unauthorised or unlawful processing, loss, damage or destruction. In many cases, the
damage and distress caused by these incidents may have been reduced or even avoided had the
personal data been encrypted.

@ It is also the case that encryption solutions are widely available and can be deployed at relatively low
cost.

e It is possible that, where data is lost or destroyed and it was not encrypted, regulatory action may be
pursued (depending on the context of each incident).

What is encryption?

@ Encryption is a mathematical function that encodes data in such a way that only authorised users can
access it.

e@ It is a way of safeguarding against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data, and is one way
in which you can demonstrate compliance with the security principle.

e@ Encryption protects information stored on mobile and static devices and in transmission, and there are a
number of different encryption options available.

@ You should consider encryption alongside other technical and organisational measures, taking into
account the benefits it can offer and the risks it can pose.

@ You should have a policy in place governing the use of encryption, including appropriate staff education.

@ You should also be aware of any sector-specific guidance that applies to you, as this may require you to
use encryption.

Encryption and data storage

e Encrypting data whilst it is being stored provides effective protection against unauthorised or unlawful
processing.

e Most modern operating systems have full-disk encryption built-in.

@ You can also encrypt individual files or create encrypted containers.

716


--- New Page 278 ---
Page number: 278
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ Some applications and databases can be configured to store data in encrypted form.

e Storing encrypted data still poses residual risks. You will need to address these depending on the
context of your processing, such as by means of an organisational policy and staff training

Encryption and data transfer

e@ Encrypting personal data whilst it is being transferred provides effective protection against interception
by a third party.
You should use encrypted communications channels when transmitting any personal data over an
untrusted network.

@ You can encrypt data prior to transmission over an insecure channel and ensure it is still protected.
However, a secure channel provides assurance that the content cannot be understood if it is intercepted.
Without additional encryption methods, such as encrypting the data itself prior to transmission, the data
will only be encrypted whilst in transit.

@ You should look to use HTTPS across your entire site. While there are some circumstances that can
make this difficult you still need to take appropriate steps such as ensuring that all areas of user input
are protected.

e Encrypted data transfer still poses residual risks. You will need to address these depending on the
context, such as by means of an organisational policy and staff training.

What types of encryption are there?

e The two types of encryption in widespread use today are symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

e@ With symmetric encryption, the same key is used for encryption and decryption. Conversely, with
asymmetric encryption, different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

@ When using symmetric encryption, it is critical to ensure that the key is transferred securely.

e The technique of cryptographic hashing is sometimes equated to encryption, but it is important to
understand that encryption and hashing are not identical concepts, and are used for different purposes.

How should we implement encryption?

@ When implementing encryption it is important to consider four things: choosing the right algorithm,
choosing the right key size, choosing the right software, and keeping the key secure.

@ Over time, vulnerabilities may be discovered in encryption algorithms that can eventually make them
insecure. You should regularly assess whether your encryption method remains appropriate.

e It is important to ensure that the key size is sufficiently large to protect against an attack over the
lifetime of the data. You should therefore assess whether your key sizes remain appropriate.

e@ The encryption software you use is also crucial. You should ensure that any solution you implement
meets current standards such as FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 197.

e Advice on appropriate encryption solutions is available from a number of organisations, including the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

e You should also ensure that you keep your keys secure, and have processes in place to generate new
keys when necessary to do so.

Personal data breaches

At a glance

e The UK GDPR introduces a duty on all organisations to report certain personal data breaches to the
relevant supervisory authority. You must do this within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach,
where feasible.

e If the breach is likely to result in a high risk of adversely affecting individuals’ rights and freedoms, you
must also inform those individuals without undue delay.

@ You should ensure you have robust breach detection, investigation and internal reporting procedures in

What is a personal data breach?

A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. This includes breaches that are the result
of both accidental and deliberate causes. It also means that a breach is more than just about losing
personal data.

Example
Personal data breaches can include:

@ access by an unauthorised third party;
e deliberate or accidental action (or inaction) by a controller or processor;

@ sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;

728


--- New Page 282 ---
Page number: 282
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;
e alteration of personal data without permission; and

@ loss of availability of personal data.

A personal data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of personal data. In short, there will be a personal data breach whenever any
personal data is accidentally lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or
passes it on without proper authorisation; or if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a
significant negative effect on individuals.

Risk-assessing data breaches

Recital 87 of the UK GDPR says that when a security incident takes place, you should quickly establish
whether a personal data breach has occurred and, if so, promptly take steps to address it, including telling
the ICO if required.

Remember, the focus of risk regarding breach reporting is on the potential negative consequences for
individuals. Recital 85 of the UK GDPR explains that:

66

“A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical,
material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or
limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of
pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by
professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person
concerned.”

This means that a breach can have a range of adverse effects on individuals, which include emotional
distress, and physical and material damage. Some personal data breaches will not lead to risks beyond
possible inconvenience to those who need the data to do their job. Other breaches can significantly affect
individuals whose personal data has been compromised. You need to assess this case by case, looking at all
relevant factors.

Example

The theft of a customer database, whose data may be used to commit identity fraud, would need to be
notified, given its likely impact on those individuals who could suffer financial loss or other
consequences. But you would not normally need to notify the ICO, for example, about the loss or
inappropriate alteration of a staff telephone list.

721


--- New Page 283 ---
Page number: 283
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

So, on becoming aware of a breach, you should contain it and assess the potential adverse consequences
for individuals, based on how serious or substantial these are, and how likely they are to happen.

For more details about assessing risk, please see section IV of the Article 29 Working Party guidelines on
personal data breach notification.

When do we need to tell individuals about a breach?

If a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the UK GDPR says you
must inform those concerned directly and without undue delay. In other words, this should take place as
soon as possible.

A ‘high risk’ means the requirement to inform individuals is higher than for notifying the ICO. Again, you
will need to assess both the severity of the potential or actual impact on individuals as a result of a breach
and the likelihood of this occurring. If the impact of the breach is more severe, the risk is higher; if the
likelihood of the consequences is greater, then again the risk is higher. In such cases, you will need to
promptly inform those affected, particularly if there is a need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage to
them. One of the main reasons for informing individuals is to help them take steps to protect themselves
from the effect of a breach.

Example

e@ A hospital suffers a breach that results in accidental disclosure of patient records. There is likely to
be a significant impact on the affected individuals because of the sensitivity of the data and their
confidential medical details becoming known to others. This is likely to result in a high risk to their
rights and freedoms, so they would need to be informed about the breach.

e A university experiences a breach when a member of staff accidentally deletes a record of alumni
contact details. The details are later re-created from a backup. This is unlikely to result in a high risk
to the rights and freedoms of those individuals. They don’t need to be informed about the breach.

e A medical professional sends incorrect medical records to another professional. They inform the
sender immediately and delete the information securely. This is unlikely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of the individual. They don’t need to be informed about the breach.

If you decide not to notify individuals, you will still need to notify the ICO unless you can demonstrate that
the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. You should also remember that the ICO has
the power to compel you to inform affected individuals if we consider there is a high risk. In any event, you
should document your decision-making process in line with the requirements of the accountability
principle.

What information must we provide to individuals when telling them about a breach?

You need to describe, in clear and plain language, the nature of the personal data breach and, at least:

e the name and contact details of any data protection officer you have, or other contact point where more
information can be obtained;

722


--- New Page 284 ---
Page number: 284
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ a description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and
@ a description of the measures taken or proposed to deal with the personal data breach and, where
appropriate, a description of the measures taken to mitigate any possible adverse effects.

If possible, you should give specific and clear advice to individuals on the steps they can take to protect
themselves, and what you are willing to do to help them. Depending on the circumstances, this may include
such things as:

e forcing a password reset;

@ advising individuals to use strong, unique passwords; and

@ telling them to look out for phishing emails or fraudulent activity on their accounts.

What breaches do we need to notify the ICO about?

When a personal data breach has occurred, you need to establish the likelihood of the risk to people’s
rights and freedoms. If a risk is likely, you must notify the ICO; if a risk is unlikely, you don’t have to report
it. However, if you decide you don’t need to report the breach, you need to be able to justify this decision,
so you should document it.

What role do processors have?

If your organisation uses a data processor, and this processor suffers a breach, then under Article 33(2) it
must inform you without undue delay as soon as it becomes aware.

Example

Your organisation (the controller) contracts an IT services firm (the processor) to archive and store
customer records. The IT firm detects an attack on its network that results in personal data about its
clients being unlawfully accessed. As this is a personal data breach, the IT firm promptly notifies you
that the breach has taken place. You in turn notify the ICO, if reportable.

This requirement allows you to take steps to address the breach and meet your breach-reporting
obligations under the UK GDPR.

If you use a processor, the requirements on breach reporting should be detailed in the contract between
you and your processor, as required under Article 28. For more details about contracts, please see our draft
UK GDPR guidance on contracts and liabilities between controllers and processors @.

 

How much time do we have to report a breach?

You must report a notifiable breach to the ICO without undue delay, but not later than 72 hours after
becoming aware of it. If you take longer than this, you must give reasons for the delay.

Section II of the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on personal data breach notification gives more details

723


--- New Page 285 ---
Page number: 285
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

of when a controller can be considered to have ‘become aware’ of a breach.

What information must a breach notification to the ICO contain?

When reporting a breach, the UK GDPR says you must provide:

e@ a description of the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible:
e@ the categories and approximate number of individuals concerned; and
e@ the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;

@ the name and contact details of the data protection officer (if your organisation has one) or other
contact point where more information can be obtained;

e@ a description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and

@ a description of the measures taken, or proposed to be taken, to deal with the personal data breach
and, where appropriate, of the measures taken to mitigate any possible adverse effects.

What if we don’t have all the required information available yet?

The UK GDPR recognises that it will not always be possible to investigate a breach fully within 72 hours to
understand exactly what has happened and what needs to be done to mitigate it. So its Article 33(4) allows
you to provide the required information in phases, as long as this is done without undue further delay.

However, we expect controllers to prioritise the investigation, give it adequate resources, and expedite it
urgently. You must still notify us of the breach when you become aware of it, and submit further
information as soon as possible. If you know you won't be able to provide full details within 72 hours, itis a
good idea to explain the delay to us and tell us when you expect to submit more information.

Example

You detect an intrusion into your network and become aware that files containing personal data have
been accessed, but you don’t know how the attacker gained entry, to what extent that data was
accessed, or whether the attacker also copied the data from your system.

You notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, explaining that you don’t yet have
all the relevant details, but that you expect to have the results of your investigation within a few days.
Once your investigation uncovers details about the incident, you give the ICO more information about
the breach without delay.

How do we notify a breach to the ICO?

To notify the ICO of a personal data breach, please see our pages on reporting a breach. These pages

 

 

Remember, a breach affecting individuals in EEA countries will engage the EU GDPR. This means that as

724


--- New Page 286 ---
Page number: 286
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

part of your breach response plan, you should establish which European data protection agency would be
your lead supervisory authority for the processing activities that have been subject to the breach. For more

identifying your lead authority @.

 

Does the UK GDPR require us to take any other steps in response to a breach?

You should ensure that you record all breaches, regardless of whether or not they need to be reported to
the ICO.

Article 33(5) requires you to document the facts regarding the breach, its effects and the remedial action
taken. This is part of your overall obligation to comply with the accountability principle, and allows us to
verify your organisation’s compliance with its notification duties under the UK GDPR.

As with any security incident, you should investigate whether or not the breach was a result of human error
or a systemic issue and see how a recurrence can be prevented. Human error is the leading cause of
reported data breaches. To reduce the risk of this, consider:

@ mandatory data protection induction and refresher training;
® support and supervising until employees are proficient in their role.
®@ updating policies and procedures for employees should feel able to report incidents of near misses;
@ working to a principle of “check twice, send once”;
@ implementing a culture of trust - employees should feel able to report incidents of near misses;
@ investigating the root causes of breaches and near misses; and
® protecting your employees and the personal data you are responsible for. This could include:
e@ Restricting access and auditing systems, or
© Implementing technical and organisational measures, eg disabling autofill.
As mentioned previously, as part of your breach management process you should undertake a risk
assessment and have an appropriate risk assessment matrix to help you manage breaches on a day-to-day
basis. This will help you to assess the impact of breaches and meet your reporting and recording

requirements. This will provide a basis for your breach policy and help you demonstrate your accountability
as a data controller.

What else should we take into account?

The following aren’t specific UK GDPR requirements regarding breaches, but you should take them into
account when you’ve experienced a breach.

As a result of a breach an organisation may experience a higher volume of data protection requests or
complaints, particularly in relation to access requests and erasure. You should have a contingency plan in
place to deal with the possibility of this. It is important that you continue to deal with those requests and
complaints, alongside any other work that has been generated as a result of the breach. You should also
consider how you might manage the impact to individuals, including explaining how they may pursue
compensation should the situation warrant it.

It is important to be aware that you may have additional notification obligations under other laws if you

725


--- New Page 287 ---
Page number: 287
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

experience a personal data breach. For example:

e@ If you are a communications service provider, you must notify the ICO of any personal data breach
within 24 hours under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). You should use
our PECR breach notification form, rather than the GDPR process. Please see our pages on PECR for
more details.

e@ If you are a UK trust service provider, you must notify the ICO of a security breach that may include a
personal data breach within 24 hours under the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS)
Regulation. You can use our eIDAS breach notification form @ or the GDPR breach-reporting process.
However, if you report it to us under the UK GDPR, this still must be done within 24 hours. Please read
our Guide to eIDAS for more information.

e If your organisation is an operator of essential services or a digital service provider, you will have
incident-reporting obligations under the NIS Directive. These are separate from personal data breach
notification under the UK GDPR. If you suffer an incident that’s also a personal data breach, you will still
need to report it to the ICO separately, and you should use the GDPR process for doing so.

You may also need to consider notifying third parties such as the police, insurers, professional bodies, or
bank or credit card companies who can help reduce the risk of financial loss to individuals.

Personal Data Breach Notification @. Although the UK has left the EU, these guidelines continue to be
relevant. You should also be aware of any recommendations issued under relevant codes of conduct or
sector-specific requirements that your organisation may be subject to.

 

What happens if we fail to notify the ICO of all notifiable breaches?

Failing to notify the ICO of a breach when required to do so can result in a heavy fine of up to £8.7 million
or 2 per cent of your global turnover. The fine can be combined with the ICO’s other corrective powers
under Article 58. It is important to make sure you have a robust breach-reporting process in place to
ensure you detect, and notify breaches, on time and to provide the necessary details, unless the personal
data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. If you decide you
don’t need to report the breach, you need to be able to justify this decision, so you should document it.

International transfers after the UK exit from the EU
Implementation Period

How have the rules on restricted transfers changed, now that the Brexit
transition period has ended?

Commission has found the UK to be adequate. This means that most data can continue to flow from the EU
and the EEA without the need for additional safeguards. The adequacy decisions do not cover data
transferred to the UK for the purposes of immigration control, or where the UK immigration exemption
applies. For this kind of data, different rules apply and the EEA sender needs to put other transfer
safeguards in place.

 

This guidance is about transferring data overseas from the UK. For further information on receiving
personal data from the EEA, read our detailed guidance on data protection and the EU.

 

Restricted transfers from the UK to other countries, including to the EEA, are subject to transfer rules under
the UK regime. These UK transfer rules broadly mirror the EU GDPR rules, but the UK has the independence
to keep the framework under review.

There are transitional arrangements which aim to smooth the transition to the new UK regime.

First, there are provisions which permit the transfer of personal data from UK to the EEA and to any
countries which, as at 31 December 2020, were covered by a European Commission ‘adequacy decision’.
This is to be kept under review by the UK Government.

The UK government has the power to make its own ‘adequacy decisions’ in relation to third countries and
international organisations. In the UK regime these are known as ‘adequacy regulations’.

There are also provisions which allow the continued use of any EU Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'),
valid as at 31 December 2020, as long as the contract was entered into before 21 September 2022.

 

Finally, there are provisions which allow certain Binding Corporate Rules to transition into the UK regime.

Are we making a transfer of personal data outside the UK?

1) Are we making a restricted transfer?
You are making a restricted transfer if:

e@ the UK GDPR applies to your processing of the personal data you are transferring.

e The scope of the UK data protection regime is set out in Articles 2 and 3 of the UK GDPR and section
207 DPA 2018 (where the DPA 2018, which incorporated the UK GDPR, applies). Please see the section
of the guide What is personal data.

@ You are agreeing to send personal data, or make it accessible, to a receiver which is located in a country
outside the UK; and

e the receiver is legally distinct from you as it is a separate company, organisation or individual. This
includes transfers to another company within the same corporate group. However, if you are sending
personal data to someone employed by you or by your company or organisation, this is not a restricted
transfer. The transfer restrictions only apply if you are sending personal data outside your company or
organisation.

730


--- New Page 292 ---
Page number: 292
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

A UK company uses a centralised human resources service in the United States provided by its parent
company. The UK company passes information about its employees to its parent company in connection
with the HR service. This is a restricted transfer.

Example

A UK company sells holidays in Australia. It sends the personal data of customers who have bought the
holidays to the hotels they have chosen in Australia in order to secure their bookings. This is a
restricted transfer.

Transfer does not mean the same as transit. If personal data is just electronically routed through a
non-UK country but the transfer is actually from one UK organisation to another, then it is not a
restricted transfer.

Example

Personal data is transferred from a controller in the UK to another controller in the UK via a server in
Australia. There is no intention that the personal data will be accessed or manipulated while it is in
Australia. Therefore there is no restricted transfer.

You are making a restricted transfer if you collect information about individuals on paper, which is not
ordered or structured in any way, and you send this to a service company located outside of the UK, to:

@ put into digital form; or

@ add to a highly structured manual filing system relating to individuals.

Example

A UK insurance broker sends a set of notes about individual customers to a company outside the UK.
These notes are handwritten and are not stored on computer or in any particular order. The non-UK
company adds the notes to a computer customer management system. This is a restricted transfer.

Putting personal data on to a website will often result in a restricted transfer. The restricted transfer

731


--- New Page 293 ---
Page number: 293
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

takes place when someone outside the UK accesses that personal data via the website.

If you load personal data onto a UK server which is then available through a website, and you plan or
anticipate that the website may be accessed from outside the UK, you should treat this as a restricted
transfer.

Do we need to make a restricted transfer?

Before making a restricted transfer you should consider whether you can achieve your aims without
actually sending personal data.

If you make the data anonymous so that it is never possible to identify individuals (even when combined
with other information which is available to receiver), it is not personal data. This means that the
restrictions do not apply and you are free to transfer the anonymised data outside the UK.

How do we make a restricted transfer in accordance with the UK GDPR?

You must work through the following questions, in order.

If by the last question, you are still unable to make the restricted transfer, then it will be in breach of the
UK GDPR.

Is the restricted transfer covered by ‘adequacy regulations’?

You may make a restricted transfer if the receiver is located in a third country or territory or is an
international organisation, covered by UK “adequacy regulations”.

UK “adequacy regulations” set out in law that the legal framework in that country, territory, sector or
international organisation has been assessed as providing ‘adequate’ protection for individuals’ rights and
freedoms for their personal data.

There are provisional arrangements so that UK “adequacy regulations” include the EEA and all countries,
territories and international organisations covered by European Commission “adequacy decisions” valid as

732


--- New Page 294 ---
Page number: 294
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

at 31 December 2020. The UK intends to review these adequacy regulations over time.
1) What countries or territories are covered by adequacy regulations?
The UK has “adequacy regulations” in relation to the following countries and territories:

e The European Economic Area (EEA) countries.
e These are the EU member states and the EFTA States.

e The EU member states are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.

e The EFTA states are Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

e EU or EEA institutions, bodies, offices or agencies.
e@ Gibraltar.

e Countries, territories and sectors covered by the European Commission’s adequacy decisions (in force at
31 December 2020)

@ These include a full finding of adequacy about the following countries and territories:
e Andorra, Argentina, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Israel, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland
and Uruguay.
@ In addition, the partial findings of adequacy about:
e Japan - only covers private sector organisations.

@ Canada - only covers data that is subject to Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic
Documents Act (PIPEDA). Not all data is subject to PIPEDA. For more details please see the EU
Commission's FAQs on the adequacy finding on the Canadian PIPEDA.

2) What if there is no adequacy decision?

You should move on to the next section Is the transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?

Is the restricted transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?

If there are no UK ‘adequacy regulations’ about the country, territory or sector for your restricted transfer,
you should then find out whether you can make the transfer subject to ‘appropriate safeguards’.

There is a list of appropriate safeguards in the UK GDPR. Each ensures that both you and the receiver of
the restricted transfer are legally required to protect individuals’ rights and freedoms in respect of their
personal data.

Have you undertaken a transfer impact assessment?

733


--- New Page 295 ---
Page number: 295
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Before you may rely on an appropriate safeguard to make a restricted transfer, you must be satisfied that
the data subjects of the transferred data continue to have a level of protection essentially equivalent to that
under the UK data protection regime.

You should do this by undertaking a risk assessment, which takes into account the protections contained in
that appropriate safeguard and the legal framework of the destination country (including laws governing
public authority access to the data).

If your assessment is that the appropriate safeguard does not provide the required level of protection, you
may include additional measures.

This assessment is undoubtedly complex in many situations. The ICO intends to issue guidance on this
topic in due course.

Further reading

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) have published adopted recommendations on measures
that supplement transfer tools. The recommendations apply to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are
included here only as useful reference about additional measures. We will be producing our own
guidance on this topic in due course.

 

 

Each appropriate safeguard is set out below:
1. A legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies

You can make a restricted transfer if it is covered by a legal instrument between public authorities or bodies
containing ‘appropriate safeguards’. The ‘appropriate safeguards’ must include enforceable rights and
effective remedies for the individuals whose personal data is transferred.

This agreement or legal instrument could also be entered into with an international organisation.

2. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
3. Standard contractual clauses (SCCs)

You can make a restricted transfer if you and the receiver have entered into a contract incorporating
standard data protection clauses recognised or issued in accordance with the UK data protection regime.
These are known as ‘standard contractual clauses’ (‘SCCs’ or ‘model clauses’).

The SCCs contain contractual obligations on you (the data exporter) and the receiver (the data importer),
and rights for the individuals whose personal data is transferred. Individuals can directly enforce those

734


--- New Page 296 ---
Page number: 296
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

rights against the data importer and the data exporter.

EU SCCs entered into prior to the end of the transitional period continue to be valid for restricted transfers
under the UK regime.

The European Commission issued new EU SCCs on 04 June 2021. These are not valid for restricted
transfers under UK GDPR (but see the next paragraph).

Following a consultation, the ICO has now issued new data protection clauses for restricted transfers, which
will replace the old EU SCCs. There is a new International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and a new
International Data Transfer Addendum to the new European Commission SCCs (Addendum). These were
laid before Parliament on 28 January 2022. Provided that there are no objections, these documents will be
in force on 21 March 2022.

 

 

The ICO has also issued a document setting out transitional provisions regarding the current EU SCCs; this
was also laid before Parliament on 28 January 2022.

You may continue to enter into new contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs until 21 September 2022. All
contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs will continue to provide ‘appropriate safeguards’ for the purpose
of UK GDPR, until 21 March 2024. From that date, if your restricted transfers continue, you must enter into
a contract on the basis of the IDTA or the Addendum or find another way to make the restricted transfer
under the UK GDPR.

When you are entering into a contract on the basis of the IDTA or the Addendum you must still carry out a
risk assessment. This is to make sure that the actual protection provided by the IDTA or Addendum, given
the actual circumstances of the restricted transfer, is sufficiently similar to the principles underpinning UK

data protection laws.

Example

A family books a holiday in Australia with a UK travel company. The UK travel company sends details of
the booking to the Australian hotel.

Each company is a separate controller, as it is processing the personal data for its own purposes and
making its own decisions.

The contract between the UK travel company and the hotel should use controller to controller standard
contractual clauses.

The UK travel company must also undertake a transfer impact assessment, and if necessary include
additional measures to ensure that the data subjects of the transferred data continue to have a level of
protection essentially equivalent to that under the UK data protection regime.

If you are making a restricted transfer from a controller to a processor, you also need to comply with
the UK GDPR requirements about using processors.

4. An approved code of conduct

You can make a restricted transfer if the receiver has signed up to a code of conduct, which has been
approved by the ICO. The code of conduct must include appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of
individuals whose personal data is transferred, with a binding and enforceable commitment by the receiver
to apply those appropriate safeguards.

The UK GDPR endorses the use of approved codes of conduct to demonstrate compliance with its
requirements.

 

No approved codes of conduct are yet in use, but we are actively working with various sector bodies and
associations. We will publish further information once codes of conduct are approved.

applies to the EU GDPR, and is included here as a useful reference. We will be producing our own
guidance on this topic in due course.

5. Certification under an approved certification scheme

You can make a restricted transfer if the receiver has a certification, under a scheme approved by the ICO.
The certification scheme must include appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals whose
personal data is transferred, with a binding and enforceable commitment by the receiver to apply those

736


--- New Page 298 ---
Page number: 298
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

appropriate safeguards.

The UK GDPR also endorses the use of approved certification mechanisms to demonstrate compliance with
its requirements.

 

No approved certification schemes are yet in use as an appropriate safeguard for international
transfers. The ICO will provide separate guidelines in relation to the use of certification schemes as a
mechanism to facilitate international transfers in due course.

6. Contractual clauses authorised by the ICO

You can make a restricted transfer if you and the receiver have entered into a bespoke contract governing a
specific restricted transfer which has been individually authorised by the ICO. This means that if you are
making a restricted transfer from the UK, the ICO will have had to have approved the contract.

7. Administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies
You can make a restricted transfer using:

e An administrative arrangement (usually a document, such as a memorandum of understanding)
between public authorities or bodies.

@ The administrative arrangement must set out ‘appropriate safeguards’ for the rights of the individuals
whose personal data is to be transferred. The ‘appropriate safeguards’ must include effective and
enforceable rights for the individuals whose personal data is transferred.

e The administrative arrangement must be individually authorised by the ICO.

What if the restricted transfer is not covered by appropriate safeguards?

If the restricted transfer is not covered by appropriate safeguards, then you need to consider the next
question: Is the restricted transfer covered by an exception?

 

Is the restricted transfer covered by an exception?

If you are making a restricted transfer that is not covered by UK ‘adequacy regulations’, nor an appropriate
safeguard, then you can only make that transfer if it is covered by one of the ‘exceptions’ set out in Article
49 of the UK GDPR.

You should only use these as true ‘exceptions’ from the general rule that you should not make a restricted

If it is covered by an exception, you may go ahead with the restricted transfer. Of course, you must still

737


--- New Page 299 ---
Page number: 299
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

comply with the rest of the UK GDPR.
Each exception is set out below:

Exception 1. Has the individual given his or her explicit consent to the restricted transfer?

As a valid consent must be both specific and informed, you must provide the individual with precise details
about the restricted transfer. You cannot obtain a valid consent for restricted transfers in general.

You should tell the individual:

e the identity of the receiver, or the categories of receiver;

@ the country or countries to which the data is to be transferred;
@ why you need to make a restricted transfer;

@ the type of data;

@ the individual’s right to withdraw consent; and

e the possible risks involved in making a transfer to a country which does not provide adequate protection
for personal data and without any other appropriate safeguards in place. For example, you might explain
that there will be no local supervisory authority, and no (or only limited) individual data protection or
privacy rights.

Given the high threshold for a valid consent, and that the consent must be capable of being withdrawn, this
may mean that using consent is not a feasible solution.

Exception 2. Do you have a contract with the individual? Is the restricted transfer necessary for
you to perform that contract?

Are you about to enter into a contract with the individual? Is the restricted transfer necessary
for you to take steps requested by the individual in order to enter into that contract?

This exception explicitly states that it can only be used for occasional restricted transfers. This means that
the restricted transfer may happen more than once but not regularly. If you are regularly making restricted

The transfer must also be necessary, which means that you cannot perform the core purpose of the
contract or the core purpose of the steps needed to enter into the contract, without making the restricted
transfer. It does not cover a transfer for you to use a cloud based IT system.

Example

A UK travel company offering bespoke travel arrangements may rely on this exception to send personal
data to a hotel in Peru, provided that it does not regularly arrange for its customers to stay at that

It is only necessary to send limited personal data for this purpose, such as the name of the guest, the

738


--- New Page 300 ---
Page number: 300
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

room required and the length of stay.

Example of necessary steps being taken at the individual’s request in order to enter into a contract:
Before the package is confirmed (and the contract entered into), the individual wishes to reserve a
room in the Peruvian hotel. The UK travel company has to send the Peruvian hotel the name of the
customer in order to hold the room.

Public authorities cannot rely on this exception when exercising their public powers.

Exception 3. Do you have (or are you entering into) a contract with an individual which benefits
another individual whose data is being transferred? Is that transfer necessary for you to either
enter into that contract or perform that contract?

As set out in Exception 2, you may only use this exception for occasional transfers, and the transfer must
be necessary for you to perform the core purposes of the contract or to enter into that contract.

You may rely on both Exceptions 2 and 3: Exception 2 for the individual entering into the contract and
Exception 3 for other people benefiting from that contract, often family members.

Exceptions 2 and 3 are not identical. You cannot rely on Exception 3 for any restricted transfers needed for
steps taken prior to entering in to the contract.

Public authorities cannot rely on this exception when exercising their public powers.

Example

Following the Exception 2 example, Exception 3 may apply if the customer is buying the travel package
for themselves and their family. Once the customer has bought the package with the UK travel
company, it may be necessary to send the names of the family members to Peruvian hotel in order to
book the rooms.

Exception 4: You need to make the restricted transfer for important reasons of public interest.

There must be a UK law which states or implies that this type of transfer is allowed for important reasons of
public interest, which may be in the spirit of reciprocity for international co-operation. For example an
international agreement or convention (which the UK has signed) that recognises certain objectives and
provides for international co-operation (such as the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism ().

 

 

This can be relied upon by both public and private entities.

If a request is made by a non-EEA authority, requesting a restrictive transfer under this exception, and
there is an international agreement such as a mutual assistance treaty (MLAT), you should consider
referring the request to the existing MLAT or agreement.

You should not rely on this exception for systematic transfers. Instead, you should consider one of the

739


--- New Page 301 ---
Page number: 301
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

yourself that the transfer is necessary for an important reason of public interest.

Exception 5: You need to make the restricted transfer to establish if you have a legal claim, to
make a legal claim or to defend a legal claim.

This exception explicitly states that you can only use it for occasional transfers. This means that the
transfer may happen more than once but not regularly. If you are regularly transferring personal data, you

The transfer must be necessary, so there must be a close connection between the need for the transfer and
the relevant legal claim.

The claim must have a basis in law, and a formal legally defined process, but it is not just judicial or
administrative procedures. This means that you can interpret what is a legal claim quite widely, to cover, for
example:

@ all judicial legal claims, in civil law (including contract law) and criminal law. The court procedure does
not need to have been started, and it covers out-of-court procedures. It covers formal pre-trial discovery
procedures.

@ administrative or regulatory procedures, such as to defend an investigation (or potential investigation) in
competition law or financial services regulation, or to seek approval for a merger.

You cannot rely on this exception if there is only the mere possibility that a legal claim or other formal
proceedings may be brought in the future.

Public authorities can rely on this exception, in relation to the exercise of their powers.

Exception 6: You need to make the restricted transfer to protect the vital interests of an
individual. He or she must be physically or legally incapable of giving consent.

This applies in a medical emergency where the transfer is needed in order to give the medical care
required. The imminent risk of serious harm to the individual must outweigh any data protection concerns.

You cannot rely on this exception to carry out general medical research.

If the individual is physically and legally capable of giving consent, then you cannot rely on this exception.

 

Exception 7: You are making the restricted transfer from a public register.
The register must be created under UK law and must be open to either:

@ the public in general; or

@ any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest.

For example, registers of companies, associations, land registers or public vehicle registers. The whole of
the register cannot be transferred, nor whole categories of personal data.

748


--- New Page 302 ---
Page number: 302
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The transfer must comply with any general laws which apply to disclosures from the public register. If the
register has been established at law and access is only given to those with a legitimate interest, part of that
assessment must take into account the data protection rights of the individuals whose personal data is to
be transferred. This may include consideration of the risk to that personal data by transferring it to a
country with less protection.

This does not cover registers run by private companies, such as credit reference databases.

Exception 8: you are making a one-off restricted transfer and it is in your compelling legitimate
interests.

If you cannot rely on any of the other exceptions, there is one final exception to consider. This exception
should not be relied on lightly and never routinely as it is only for truly exceptional circumstances.

For this exception to apply to your restricted transfer:

1. there must be no UK ‘adequacy regulations’ which apply.

2. you are unable to use any of the other appropriate safeguards. You must give serious consideration to
this, even if it would involve significant investment from you.

3. none of the other exceptions apply. Again, you must give serious consideration to the other exceptions.
It may be that you can obtain explicit consent with some effort or investment.

4. your transfer must not be repetitive — that is it may happen more than once but not regularly.

5. the personal data must only relate to a limited number of individuals. There is no absolute threshold for
this. The number of individuals involved should be part of the balancing exercise you must undertake in
para (g) below.

6. The transfer must be necessary for your compelling legitimate interests. Please see the section of the
guide on legitimate interests as a lawful basis for processing, but bearing mind that this exception
requires a higher standard, as it must be a compelling legitimate interest. An example is a transfer of
personal data to protect a company’s IT systems from serious immediate harm.

7. On balance your compelling legitimate interests outweigh the rights and freedoms of the individuals.

8. You have made a full assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer and provided suitable
safeguards to protect the personal data. Suitable safeguards might be strict confidentiality agreements,
a requirement for data to be deleted soon after transfer, technical controls to prevent the use of the data
for other purposes, or sending pseudonymised or encrypted data. This must be recorded in full in your
documentation of your processing activities.

9. You have informed the ICO of the transfer. We will ask to see full details of all the steps you have taken
as set out above.

.0. You have informed the individual of the transfer and explained your compelling legitimate interest to
them.

In more detail - European Data Protection Board

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49
under Regulation 2016/679. These guidelines apply to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are included
only as useful reference.

 

 

From 21 September 2022, the EU Contractual clauses issued by the European Commission under the
old Data Protection Directive (the old EU SCCs), are no longer valid for new restricted transfers from
the UK. They remain valid if they were used in existing contracts entered into prior to 21 September
2022 until March 2024.

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) after the
transition period ends

The EU Commission announced on 28 June 2021 that adequacy decisions for the UK have been
approved. We are in the process of updating our guidance to reflect this decision.

Once the transition period for leaving the EU ends, the UK will be able to produce its own SCCs for
restricted transfers made from the UK. In the meantime, UK controllers can continue to use the existing EU
SCCs (valid as at 31 December). See below for more detail.

some time in 2021. This means they will not be valid SCCs for restricted transfers from the UK.

The recent Schrems II decision will continue to apply if you are making a restricted transfer from the UK
using SCCs. This decision requires that you must make an assessment as to whether those SCCs provide
protection which is ‘essentially equivalent’ to the protections in the UK data protection regime, and if
necessary put in place additional measures.

This assessment is undoubtedly complex in many situations. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
have published for consultation, Recommendations on measures that supplement transfer tools @. We
expect the final version to be issued some time in 2021. The recommendations (when finalised) will apply
to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are included here only as useful reference about additional measures.
The ICO intends to issue its own guidance on this topic in due course.

 

New Restricted Transfers from the UK

You can continue to use the current EU SCCs for restricted transfers from the UK.

You are able to make changes to those EU SCCs so they make sense in a UK context provided you do not
change the legal meaning of the SCCs. For example, changing references from the old EU Data Protection
to the UK GDPR, changing references to the EU or Member States, to the UK, and changing references to a
supervisory authority to the ICO.

Otherwise you must not make any changes to the SCCs, unless it is to add protections or more clauses on
business related issues. You can add parties (ie additional data importers or exporters) provided they are
also bound by the SCCs.

We have created UK versions of the SCCs (with guidance), with suggested UK changes made for you.

Existing data transfers

After the transition period ends, you can continue to rely on existing SCCs which you have in place for
restricted transfers from the UK. Although after the Schrems II decision, you should be reviewing whether
they provide sufficient protection for data subjects and if necessary taking additional measures.

Future changes to SCCs

The ICO has consulted on UK SCCs and intends to publish them in 2022.

The ICO and the Secretary of State must keep the transitional arrangements for SCCs under review. It may
be that at some point the EU SCCs will cease to be valid, for new and/or existing restricted transfers from
the UK. The ICO will provide more information about this when this situation arises, giving you plenty of
notice.

International data transfer agreement and guidance

On 2 February 2022, the Secretary of State laid before Parliament the international data transfer
agreement (IDTA), the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard
contractual clauses for international data transfers (Addendum) and a document setting out transitional
provisions. This final step followed the consultation the ICO ran in 2021. The documents were issued under
Section 119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 and following Parliamentary approval came into force on 21
March 2022.

Exporters can use the IDTA or the Addendum as a transfer tool to comply with Article 46 of the UK GDPR
when making restricted transfers.

The IDTA and Addendum replaced standard contractual clauses for international transfers. They take into
account the binding judgement of the European Court of Justice, in the case commonly referred to as
“Schrems II”.

These documents are immediately of use to organisations transferring personal data outside of the UK:

@ Transitional provisions @

The IDTA and Addendum form part of the wider UK package to assist international transfers. This includes
independently supporting the Government’s approach to adequacy assessments of third countries.

We consulted on our approach to international transfers under UK GDPR from 11 August 2021 to 11
October 2021. When finalising the documents we considered the detailed responses we received and will be

Exemptions

At a glance

e The UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 set out exemptions from some of the rights and
obligations in some circumstances.

e@ Whether or not you can rely on an exemption often depends on why you process personal data.
@ You should not routinely rely on exemptions; you should consider them on a case-by-case basis.
@ You should justify and document your reasons for relying on an exemption.

What are exemptions?

In some circumstances, the DPA 2018 provides an exemption from particular UK GDPR provisions. If an
exemption applies, you may not have to comply with all the usual rights and obligations.

There are several different exemptions; these are detailed in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018. They add to
and complement a number of exceptions already built in to certain UK GDPR provisions.

746


--- New Page 308 ---
Page number: 308
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

This part of the Guide focuses on the exemptions in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018. We give guidance on
the exceptions built in to the UK GDPR in the parts of the Guide that relate to the relevant provisions.

The exemptions in the DPA 2018 can relieve you of some of your obligations for things such as:

@ the right to be informed;

@ the right of access;

@ dealing with other individual rights;

@ reporting personal data breaches; and

® complying with the principles.
Some exemptions apply to only one of the above, but others can exempt you from several things.

Some things are not listed here as exemptions, although in practice they work a bit like an exemption. This
is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR. Here are some examples:

e Domestic purposes - personal data processed in the course of a purely personal or household activity,
with no connection to a professional or commercial activity, is outside the UK GDPR’s scope. This means
that if you only use personal data for such things as writing to friends and family or taking pictures for
your own enjoyment, you are not subject to the UK GDPR.

e Law enforcement - the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement
purposes is outside the UK GDPR’s scope (e.g. the Police investigating a crime). Instead, this type of
processing is subject to the rules in Part 3 of the DPA 2018. See our Guide to Law Enforcement
Processing for further information.

e Intelligence services processing - personal data processed by the intelligence services (eg MI5) and
their processors is outside the UK GDPR’s scope. Instead, this type of processing is subject to the rules
in Part 4 of the DPA 2018. See our Guide to Intelligence Services Processing for further information.

How do exemptions work?

Whether or not you can rely on an exemption generally depends on your purposes for processing personal
data.

Some exemptions apply simply because you have a particular purpose. But others only apply to the extent
that complying with the UK GDPR would:

@ be likely to prejudice your purpose (e.g. have a damaging or detrimental effect on what you are doing);
or

@ prevent or seriously impair you from processing personal data in a way that is required or necessary for
your purpose.

Exemptions should not routinely be relied upon or applied in a blanket fashion. You must consider each
exemption on a case-by-case basis.

If an exemption does apply, sometimes you will be obliged to rely on it (for instance, if complying with UK
GDPR would break another law), but sometimes you can choose whether or not to rely on it.

In line with the accountability principle, you should justify and document your reasons for relying on an

747


--- New Page 309 ---

exemption so you can demonstrate your compliance.

If you cannot identify an exemption that covers what you are doing with personal data, you must comply
with the UK GDPR as normal.

Crime and taxation: general

There are two parts to this exemption. The first part can apply if you process personal data for the
purposes of:

@ the prevention and detection of crime;

e the apprehension or prosecution of offenders; or

@ the assessment or collection of a tax or duty or an imposition of a similar nature.
It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

e the right to be informed;

@ all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling;

@ notifying individuals of personal data breaches;

e the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle, except the requirement for processing to be lawful;

749

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ the purpose limitation principle; and

@ all the other principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the other individual
rights.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would be likely to
prejudice your purposes of processing. If this is not so, you must comply with the UK GDPR as normal.

Example

A bank conducts an investigation into suspected financial fraud. The bank wants to pass its
investigation file, including the personal data of several customers, to the National Crime Agency (NCA)
for further investigation. The bank’s investigation and proposed disclosure to the NCA are for the
purposes of the prevention and detection of crime. The bank decides that, were it to inform the
individuals in question about this processing of their personal data, this would be likely to prejudice the
investigation because they might abscond or destroy evidence. So the bank relies on the crime and
taxation exemption and, in this case, does not comply with the right to be informed.

The second part of this exemption applies when another controller obtains personal data processed for any
of the purposes mentioned above for the purposes of discharging statutory functions. The controller that
obtains the personal data is exempt from the UK GDPR provisions below to the same extent that the
original controller was exempt:

@ The right to be informed.

e The right of access.

e All the principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the right of access.

Note that if you are a competent authority processing personal data for law enforcement purposes (e.g. the
Police conducting a criminal investigation), your processing is subject to the rules of Part 3 of the DPA

2018. See our Guide to Law Enforcement Processing for information on how individual rights may be
restricted when personal data is processed for law enforcement purposes by competent authorities.

assessment system.

The risk assessment system must be operated by a government department, local authority, or another
authority administering housing benefit, for the purposes of:
e@ the assessment or collection of a tax or duty; or
e@ the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, where the offence
involves the unlawful use of public money or an unlawful claim for payment out of public money.

It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

@ the right of access;

@ all the principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the right of access.
But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would prevent the risk

assessment system from operating effectively. If this is not so, you must comply with these provisions as
normal.

Information required to be disclosed by law or in connection with legal
proceedings

This exemption has three parts. The first part can apply if you are required by law to make personal data
available to the public.

It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

e all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling;

e the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle, except the requirement for processing to be lawful;
@ the purpose limitation principle; and
@ all the other principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the other individual

rights.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would prevent you
meeting your legal obligation to make personal data publicly available.

Example

The Registrar of Companies is legally obliged to maintain a public register of certain information about
companies, including the names and (subject to certain restrictions) addresses of company directors. A
director asks to exercise his right to erasure by having his name and address removed from the
register. The request does not need to be complied with as it would prevent the Registrar meeting his
legal obligation to make that information publicly available.

The second part of this exemption can apply if you are required by law, or court order, to disclose personal
data to a third party. It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that
complying with those provisions would prevent you disclosing the personal data.

Example

An employer receives a court order to hand over the personnel file of one of its employees to an
insurance company for the assessment of a claim. Normally, the employer would not be able to disclose
this information because doing so would be incompatible with the original purposes for collecting the
data (contravening the purpose limitation principle). However, on this occasion the employer is exempt
from the purpose limitation principle’s requirements because it would prevent the employer disclosing
personal data that it must do by court order.

The third part of this exemption can apply if it is necessary for you to disclose personal data for the
purposes of, or in connection with:

e legal proceedings, including prospective legal proceedings;
® obtaining legal advice; or

e establishing, exercising or defending legal rights.

It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that complying with them would
prevent you disclosing the personal data. If complying with these provisions would not prevent the
disclosure, you cannot rely on the exemption.

Example

A primary school collects information about the parents of the children who attend the school. The
school has informed the parents that they will only use their personal data for specified purposes
related to the care, welfare and education of their children.

However, a dispute has arisen between a teacher and one of the parents of a 7 year old child. The

752


--- New Page 314 ---
Page number: 314
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

matter escalates, and the parent makes a number of allegations against the teacher. The school is
concerned that the parent’s behaviour is threatening and abusive, and decides to take legal action
against them. The parent writes to the school and asks it not to share their information with any other
organisation or individual.

The school relies on the exemption to the extent that complying with the request, and complying with
the purpose limitation principle, would prevent it from disclosing the information to its solicitor.

Disclosure prohibited or restricted by an enactment

Five separate exemptions apply to personal data that is prohibited or restricted from disclosure by an
enactment.

Each of them exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

But the exemptions only apply to personal data restricted or prohibited from disclosure by certain specific
provisions of enactments covering:

@ adoption;

@ parental orders; and

@ children’s hearings.

If you think any of these exemptions might apply to your processing of personal data, see Schedule 4 of

Immigration

The exemption outlines specific rights in the UK GDPR which can be restricted if those rights would be likely
to prejudice immigration matters.

The exemption can only be applied by the Secretary of State (including the Home Office and its agencies)
when processing data for the purposes of maintaining effective immigration control, including
investigatory/detection work (the immigration purposes).

The exemption is not available to other controllers who liaise with the Home Office on immigration matters.
The Secretary of State exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

e the right of access;

@ the right to erasure;

e the right to restrict processing;

@ the right to object;

@ all the principles, but only so far as they relate to the rights to be informed, of access, to erasure, to

restrict processing and to object.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that applying these provisions would be likely to prejudice
processing for the immigration purposes. If not, the exemption does not apply.

The Secretary of State is required to keep records of the use of the exemption and to inform individuals
that the exemption has been applied unless it would be prejudicial to immigration purposes to inform them.

The exemption also requires that the Secretary of State has an immigration exemption policy document in
place.

Functions designed to protect the public

This exemption can apply if you process personal data for the purposes of discharging one of six functions
designed to protect the public.

The first four functions must: be conferred on a person by enactment; be a function of the Crown, a
Minister of the Crown or a government department; or be of a public nature and exercised in the public
interest. These functions are:

1. to protect the public against financial loss due to the seriously improper conduct (or unfitness, or
incompetence) of financial services providers, or in the management of bodies corporate, or due to the
conduct of bankrupts;

2. to protect the public against seriously improper conduct (or unfitness, or incompetence);

3. to protect charities or community interest companies against misconduct or mismanagement in their
administration, to protect the property of charities or community interest companies from loss or
misapplication, or to recover the property of charities or community interest companies; or

4. to secure workers’ health, safety and welfare or to protect others against health and safety risks in
connection with (or arising from) someone at work.

The fifth function must be conferred by enactment on: the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration;
the Commissioner for Local Administration in England; the Health Service Commissioner for England; the
Public Services Ombudsman for Wales; the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman; the Prison

the failure to provide a service that it is a function of a public body to provide.

The sixth function must be conferred by enactment on the Competition and Markets Authority. This function
is:

6. to protect members of the public from business conduct adversely affecting them, to regulate conduct
(or agreements) preventing, restricting or distorting commercial competition, or to regulate
undertakings abusing a dominant market position.

If you process personal data for any of the above functions, you are exempt from the UK GDPR’s provisions
on:

@ the right to be informed;

@ all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling; and

your functions as normal, you must do so.

or literary material; and

® you reasonably believe that the publication of the material would be in the public interest, taking into
account the special importance of the general public interest in freedom of expression, any specific
public interest in the particular subject, and the potential to harm individuals.

When deciding whether it is reasonable to believe that publication would be in the public interest, you must
(if relevant) have regard to:

e the Ofcom Broadcasting Code; and

Health data — processed by a court

This exemption can apply to health data (personal data concerning health) that is processed by a court.
It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

@ all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling; and

@ all the principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the other individual
rights.

But the exemption only applies if the health data is:

© supplied in a report or evidence given to the court in the course of proceedings; and
@ those proceedings are subject to certain specific statutory rules that allow the data to be withheld from
the individual it relates to.

Health data — serious harm

This exemption can apply if you receive a subject access request for health data.

It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on the right of access regarding your processing of health
data.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that compliance with the right of access would be likely to
cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of any individual. This is known as the ‘serious harm
test’ for health data.

You can only rely on this exemption if:

® you are a health professional; or

e@ within the last six months you have obtained an opinion from an appropriate health professional that the
serious harm test for health data is met. Even if you have done this, you still cannot rely on the
exemption if it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to re-consult the appropriate health
professional.

If you think this exemption might apply to a subject access request you have received, see paragraph 2(1)
of Schedule 3, Part 2 of the DPA 2018 for full details of who is considered an appropriate health
professional.

Example

The senior management of an organisation is planning a re-organisation. This is likely to involve
making certain employees redundant, and this possibility is included in management plans. Before the
plans are revealed to the workforce, an employee makes a subject access request. In responding to
that request, the organisation does not have to reveal its plans to make him redundant if doing so
would be likely to prejudice the conduct of the business (perhaps by causing staff unrest before the
management's plans are announced).

Example

An individual makes a claim to his insurance company. The claim is for compensation for personal
injuries he sustained in an accident. The insurance company disputes the seriousness of the injuries
and the amount of compensation it should pay. An internal paper sets out the company’s position on
these matters including the maximum sum it would be willing to pay to avoid the claim going to court.
If the individual makes a subject access request to the insurance company, it would not have to send
him the internal paper - because doing so would be likely to prejudice the negotiations to settle the
claim.

National security and defence

If you are processing personal data to safeguard national security or for defence purposes, there is an
exemption provided for at section 26 of the DPA 2018. You may be able to apply this exemption if you
process data under the UK GDPR.

National security is not specifically defined but it can cover processing for:

@ protection against specific threats, such as from terrorists or hostile states;
@ protection of potential targets even in the absence of specific threats; and

@ international co-operation with other countries.
If the exemption applies, it can exempt you from:

@ any of the data protection principles (except lawfulness requirements);
@ any of the rights of individuals;

® personal data breach reporting;

e international transfers requirements; and

® some of the Commissioner’s duties and enforcement powers.

You must always ensure that your processing is lawful, and that you have a lawful basis under Article 6.
There is no exemption from the requirement to process lawfully.

You must always comply with your general accountability and governance obligations.

If you are processing special category data for national security purposes there is no exemption from
Article 9, but special rules apply. Section 28 of the DPA permits the processing of special category data for
safeguarding national security, provided you ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects.

This is not a blanket exemption. You must be able to show that the exemption from specified data
protection standards is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security. When deciding whether

Immigration exemption

About this guidance

This guidance discusses the immigration exemption in detail. Read it if you have detailed questions not
answered in the guide, or if you need a deeper understanding to help you apply this exemption in practice.
It is aimed at DPOs and those with specific data protection responsibilities in larger organisations.

If you haven't yet read the ‘in brief’ page on the immigration exemption in the Guide to Data Protection,
you should read that first. It introduces this topic and sets out the key points you need to know, along with
practical checklists to help you comply.

 

In detail

@ What is the immigration exemption?

@ When should this exemption be used?

@ What is an immigration exemption policy document?

@ What is the prejudice test?

@ What rights does the immigration exemption apply to?

@ How does the exemption affect the individual’s right to be informed?

@ How does the exemption affect the individual’s right of access?

® Do we need to inform individuals that the immigration exemption has been applied?

@ What happens if an immigration investigation becomes a criminal investigation?

What is the immigration exemption?

The exemption outlines specific rights in the UK GDPR which can be restricted if those rights would be likely
to prejudice immigration matters.

The exemption can only be applied by the Secretary of State (including the Home Office and its agencies)
who processes data for the purposes of:

@ the maintenance of effective immigration control; or

@ the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective
immigration control.

It is not available to other controllers, such as employers, universities and the police, who liaise with the
Home Office on immigration matters.

It also requires that the Secretary of State has an immigration exemption policy document in place.

The exemption is set out in Schedule 2 Part 1 Paragraph 4 of the Data Protection Act 2018, and has been
amended by The Data Protection Act 2018 (Amendment of Schedule 2 Exemptions) Regulations 2022. The
amendments came into force on 31 January 2022 in response to a court judgment. The amendments

779


--- New Page 341 ---
Page number: 341
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

introduce further safeguards to the exemption including limiting its use to the Secretary of State, requiring
an immigration exemption policy document, and a requirement to keep records and inform individuals that
the exemption has been used.

In the UK, the right to appeal is an integral part of immigration control. Individuals have the right to have
their immigration applications reviewed and to submit an appeal against an asylum decision or a
deportation order.

You should ensure that you are not undermining this review and appeals system process by using this
exemption. For example, by refusing an individual access to their personal data.

You should only restrict the exercising of a data subject’s rights if the exemption applies and there is a valid
reason to apply it.

Your application of the exemption must be proportionate to the circumstances and you must carefully
consider and document each instance. You should not apply the immigration exemption as a blanket
restriction on the data protection rights of individuals, such as migrants or people who have overstayed
their permission to remain. You should only apply it, if required, when the exercise of those rights is likely
to cause prejudice to effective immigration control. You must apply the exemption on a case by case basis.
You must have regard to your immigration exemption policy document when deciding if the exemption
applies.

Example

An individual seeking asylum in the UK has had their application refused. They make a request to the
Home Office for all their personal data so that they can appeal against this decision.

The Home Office is not investigating the individual and can provide the personal data it holds without
prejudice to its immigration control function. It does not hold any confidential intelligence (a factor
listed for consideration in its immigration exemption policy document) which the individual is unaware
of and it has no reason to withhold any of the requested personal data. It must not use the exemption
to frustrate a lawful appeal.

In these circumstances the exemption does not apply and should not be used. The Home Office should
therefore disclose the information it holds.

There are various immigration offences (eg overstaying leave to remain) and these are usually dealt with
by the administrative removal of the offender rather than through the criminal justice process. Therefore
the ‘crime and taxation’ exemption does not usually apply in circumstances where immigration control is
concerned. However the two exemptions involve similar considerations. Instead of considering prejudice to
the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, the immigration exemption requires you to consider prejudice
to the administrative functions concerning effective immigration control.

 

There is no assumption of criminal proceedings with the immigration exemption, although the section below
considers what happens if an immigration investigation does become a criminal investigation.

As noted above, this exemption is only available to the Secretary of State, which includes the Home Office

When should this exemption be used?

that giving effect to those rights would be likely to prejudice:

@ the maintenance of effective immigration control; or

@ the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective
immigration control.

The phrase ‘to the extent that’ means that you should not apply the immigration exemption as a blanket
exemption to restrict all of those rights for all the data you hold. Instead, you need to consider the
application of the exemption on a case by case basis, taking into account your immigration exemption
policy document.

the identified immigration purposes. The exemption therefore only applies when the exercise of the specific
right results in the processing of personal data which would be likely to prejudice the identified function.

Therefore the default position of the controller should be to comply with the requirements of the UK GDPR
and the DPA 2018 as far as possible. It highlights the importance of identifying the specific reason for
applying the exemption in each case.

Many of the rights set out in the UK GDPR contain built-in restrictions or exceptions. The expectation is that
you should rely on these more generic built-in restrictions in preference to the immigration exemption, if
they can achieve the same outcome. This is because the immigration exemption (along with the other
exemptions set out in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018) is an exemption for a specific purpose, and can only
be used if applying the usual provisions of the UK GDPR would cause a specific problem.

You should therefore first consider the restrictions to an individual’s rights as laid out in other relevant UK
GDPR articles. For example, you should consider whether an objection to processing is valid under Article
21, or whether you should allow or refuse an individual exercising their right under Article 17.

You should only use the immigration exemption in circumstances where there are no viable alternatives.

Example

An individual with Leave to Remain in the UK applies to the Home Office to have their personal data
erased. The individual is under investigation for an immigration offence.

The personal data held is still necessary for the purpose it was originally collected for, and the Home
Office can rely on Article 17(3)(b) to refuse the request. This is because the right to erasure does not
apply if personal data needs to be retained for:

@ compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which
the controller is subject; or

e@ the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
vested in the controller.

In this case, the restriction of the individual’s rights is accomplished without relying on the immigration
exemption.

What is an immigration exemption policy document?

In order to be able to apply the exemption, the Secretary of State must have an immigration exemption
policy document in place.

The immigration exemption policy document must explain the policies and processes the Secretary of State
(including the Home Office and its agencies) will use to decide how compliance with a provision under the
UK GDPR would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of effective immigration control. For example, it
should describe the factors the organisation will consider when making the decision in each case.

The document must also explain the policies in place to make sure that the use of the immigration
exemption does not allow personal data to be abused, accessed, or transferred in a manner that does not
comply with the UK GDPR.

When considering whether the immigration exemption applies, the Secretary of State must have regard to
the immigration exemption policy document.

The Secretary of State must also:

@ review the immigration exemption policy document and (if necessary) update it from time to time; and

@ publish it.

What is the prejudice test?

The DPA 2018 does not explain what is meant by ‘would be likely to prejudice’. However, the ICO’s view is
there must be a real and substantial chance of prejudice, rather than just a hypothetical or remote
possibility that complying with the provision would noticeably damage the discharge of the function
concerned.

There should be a causal link between compliance and the prejudice claimed, and you must be able to show
how the exercising of a specific right would be likely to lead to the prejudice. In reaching a decision on this,
you should take into account the immigration exemption policy document. You must make this reasoning
available to the ICO if required.

The prejudice test has a high threshold and you should not apply the exemption in a blanket fashion. It
must be both necessary and proportionate to apply the exemption and you must only apply it to specific
rights where the likelihood of prejudice is present, rather than applying this across the board to all the
rights.

You must consider whether the application of the exemption is a proportionate response. You may consider
that there is a pressing social need to apply the immigration exemption, but you must also take into
account whether this outweighs your obligation to individuals under the UK GDPR. They have rights over
their personal data which you must consider in all circumstances, in particular, the right of access.

It is therefore important in every case that you consider whether the data protection rights of the individual
override the identified risk of prejudice. Your application of the exemption must be proportionate to the
circumstances and you must carefully consider and document each instance.

It is also important to note that prejudice changes over time. While personal data may be withheld during
an ongoing investigation, disclosure of this information is unlikely to present the same risk afterwards.

Therefore, you should keep the immigration exemption under review. You should always consider an
individual’s current circumstances. For example, you should not assume that if you have once refused to
provide a data subject with all their personal data under this exemption, then your response will always
remain the same. Should they submit a new subject access request to you, you should assess whether
circumstances have changed and whether providing the data would now prejudice the maintenance of
effective immigration control. If not, you may be able to respond more fully to this new request.

Example

An individual is suspected of overstaying their student visa in the UK. While an investigation is carried
out, they make a request for all personal data held about them.

783


--- New Page 345 ---
Page number: 345
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The Home Office may withhold information which, if disclosed, will prejudice the investigation. This
might include information which identifies any proposed actions against the individual.

However the Home Office should not apply a blanket exemption. It could disclose any personal data
relating to the individual’s previous visa application and any other information it holds, unless it can
show that the disclosure will be likely to impact on the ongoing investigation or any expected actions
arising from it.

The individual successfully extends their visa due to extenuating circumstances and is allowed to
remain in the UK for another two years. They make another request for their personal data.

The Home Office will have to carefully consider this, taking into account the guidance set out in the
immigration exemption policy document. As there are no active proceedings against the individual, the
exemption will only continue to be available if there is any remaining prejudice to immigration controls,
and the Home Office should not use it simply because it applied previously.

Although the immigration exemption may no longer apply in this context, other exemptions under
Schedule 2 of the DPA 2018 may be relevant.

What rights does the immigration exemption apply to?

The exemption applies to the following rights:

@ right to be informed;

@ right of access;

@ right to erasure;

e right to restrict processing; and

@ right to object.

The exemption does not restrict other data subject rights. More information is available in our UK GDPR

Example

An individual being investigated for an immigration offence contacts the Home Office to request that
their date of birth is rectified, as this is inaccurately reflected in their records.

The right to rectification is not a right which is restricted under this exemption. The Home Office must
therefore update their records and respond to the individual within the time frame permitted.

External link

How does the exemption affect the individual’s right to be informed?

The right to be informed means that the data subject has the right to be given certain privacy information
about the processing of their data. This includes for example, the purposes of the processing and the
identity and contact details of the controller. This applies whether you obtain personal data from the
individual or from someone else.

The provision of this privacy information also meets the transparency requirement of Article 5(a).

However, if you are investigating an individual, you may not wish to tell them that you are processing their
personal data for the purposes of immigration control. This would alert them to your investigation, and
would be likely to prejudice the purpose of the processing.

In these circumstances, you may apply the immigration exemption and restrict the individual’s right to be
informed. You do not have to provide privacy information if this is likely to prejudice the identified
immigration purposes.

As discussed above, the immigration exemption also provides an exemption from the data protection
principles so far as their provisions correspond to the listed data subject rights. Therefore in these
circumstances, it provides an exemption from the transparency requirement of Article 5(a) to the extent
that this corresponds with the right to be informed.

However, although you may therefore be exempt from providing privacy information to the individual you
are investigating, you still have to comply with the other requirements of Article 5(a) and identify a lawful
basis for processing. This lawfulness part of Article 5(a) does not affect (or correspond to) any of the rights
listed above and so you are not exempt from this particular obligation.

How does the exemption affect the individual’s right of access?

An individual may make a subject access request to you, in order to obtain a copy of the data you hold
about them. You must consider the circumstances of each case and may apply the exemption only if you
consider that to comply with the right of access would be likely to prejudice effective immigration control.

You may not wish to provide a copy of all the personal data you hold, if this would prejudice a current
investigation into that individual’s immigration status, or would otherwise prejudice the maintenance of
effective immigration controls. However, you may be able to provide some personal data in response to the

785


--- New Page 347 ---
Page number: 347
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

request, if this does not prejudice your investigation.

Example

An individual who has been refused entry to the UK at an airport e-Passport gate makes a Subject
Access Request to the Home Office, asking for information about why their entry was refused.

Providing the individual with this information would involve disclosing details about the technical
operation of the e-Passport gates, which if made public, could have a detrimental effect on border
control, potentially enabling attempts to undermine the system.

In this case, the Home Office may legitimately rely on the immigration exemption as a reason to refuse
to disclose the requested information.

Do we need to inform individuals that the immigration exemption has been applied?

You should keep a record of the decision to apply the immigration exemption, and your reasoning, each
time it is applied. Individuals should be informed that the immigration exemption has been applied unless it
would be prejudicial to effective immigration control to do so. See ‘What is the prejudice test?’ for guidance
on how to assess whether an individual being informed that the immigration exemption has been used
would be prejudicial to carrying out immigration control.

Example

An individual seeking asylum in the UK has had their application refused. They make a request to the
Home Office for all their personal data so that they can appeal against this decision.

The Home Office is investigating them for the use of identification which does not belong to them and it
would prejudice the investigation to provide them with the personal data relating to this investigation.

The Home Office therefore may apply this exemption in order to restrict the individual’s right of access.
However it should provide as much data as it can and inform the individual where the immigration
exemption has been applied, if this does not prejudice the investigation.

What happens if an immigration investigation becomes a criminal investigation?

If the investigation of an immigration offence develops into a criminal investigation, and if you are a
competent authority processing personal data for the purposes of law enforcement, you should undertake
processing under Part 3 of the DPA 2018, rather than under the UK GDPR regime. Personal data has to be

786


--- New Page 348 ---
Page number: 348
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

handled according to the requirements laid out in Part 3, which has its own restrictions about the rights of
individuals. More information is available in our guide to law enforcement processing.

 

Example

The Home Office is investigating an individual for an immigration offence. Investigations show that they
were involved in the trafficking of individuals into forced labour in the UK. The Home Office now has to
investigate under Part 3 of the DPA 2018 as a criminal offence.

Should the individual choose to exercise any of their data protection rights, the Home Office will have
to consider these under the requirements of Part 3 of the DPA 2018 and apply restrictions accordingly.

National security and defence

At a glance

e@ In order to safeguard national security or for defence purposes there is an exemption provided for at
section 26 of the DPA. It is capable of exempting personal data from most of the data protection
principles and obligations, and individuals rights, where this is required to safeguard national security or
for defence purposes.

@ This guidance only considers the national security aspects of this exemption. In the future, the ICO will
develop additional content on the defence aspects of this exemption, and will publish an amended
version of this guidance in due course.

@ You may be able to apply this exemption if you process data under the UK GDPR.

e@ This is not a blanket exemption. You must be able to show that the exemption from specified data
protection standards is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security. When deciding
whether to use this exemption, we suggest you consider whether complying with the UK GDPR would
raise a real possibility of an adverse effect on national security.

@ A Minister of the Crown (specifically a member of the Cabinet, the Attorney General or the Advocate
General for Scotland) can issue a certificate which covers your processing in relation to national security.
If you have decided that it is necessary to rely on the exemption, you can rely on this certificate as
conclusive proof that the exemption applies. However, you should not assume that you must apply the
exemption, simply because a certificate has been issued. We will publish details of relevant certificates.

@ You must always have a lawful basis under Article 6, and show that your processing is more generally
lawful. There is no exemption from the requirement to process lawfully.

@ You must always comply with your general accountability and governance obligations.

e Modified rules apply to how you process special category data and to your security obligations.

About the DPA 2018
What does “national security” cover?

“National security” is not specifically defined and can be interpreted in a flexible way to adapt to changing
threats. Thirty years ago, it would have been difficult or even impossible to predict the threats that
developments in computer and communications technology could give rise to, or how such developments

789


--- New Page 351 ---
Page number: 351
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

could be exploited by terrorists or hostile states. It is generally understood to cover the security and
well-being of the UK as a whole, its population, and its institutions and system of government. For
example, it can cover:

@ protection against specific threats, such as from terrorists or hostile states;

@ protection of potential targets even in the absence of specific threats; and

@ international co-operation with other countries.

What is the national security exemption?

Section 26 of the DPA 2018 sets out a broad exemption from specified provisions of the UK GDPR:

66

“...if exemption from the provision is required for—

(a) the purpose of safeguarding national security, or
(b) defence purposes.”

This guidance only focuses on the national security element of this exemption.
If the exemption applies, it can exempt you from:

@ any of the data protection principles (except lawfulness requirements);
@ any of the rights of individuals;

® personal data breach reporting;

@ international transfers requirements; and

© some of the Commissioner’s duties and enforcement powers.
You must always ensure that your processing is lawful, and that you have a lawful basis under Article 6.

If you are processing special category data for national security purposes there is no exemption from
Article 9, but special rules apply. Section 28 of the DPA permits the processing of special category data for
safeguarding national security, provided you ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects. For more information on this see What are the special rules for special category
data? below.

 

If you are processing criminal offence data, and can apply this exemption, you are also exempt from your
obligations under article 10 of the UK GDPR.

You must always comply with your accountability and governance obligations, including the requirement to
be able to demonstrate compliance (Article 5(2) of the UK GDPR).

Although there is no exemption from security obligations, modified provisions apply to data processed for
national security purposes. For more information on this see How are our security obligations affected?

e Accountability and governance

How does the exemption work?

Given the importance of national security, you can apply this exemption to a greater number of provisions
than many other exemptions.

The exemption applies if it is “required” to safeguard national security. In this context, “required” means
that the use of the exemption is “reasonably necessary”. This is linked to human rights standards. This
means that any interference with privacy rights should be necessary and proportionate in a democratic
society to meet a pressing social need.

The exemption is capable of being applied to a large number of the data protection provisions. However, it
is not a blanket exemption and national security will not automatically override individual rights. You should
consider your use of the exemption on a case-by-case basis.

In particular, it is not enough that the data is processed for national security purposes. You must consider
the actual consequences to national security if you had to comply with the particular UK GDPR provision. If
you can reasonably comply with the provision without affecting national security, you must. Of course, this
is subject to any other exemptions that might apply in the specific circumstances.

You don’t need to show that compliance would lead to a direct or immediate harm or threat. It is enough to
show that there is a real possibility of an adverse effect on national security in a broader sense. For
example, in freedom of information cases, courts have recognised that terrorists can be highly motivated.
There may therefore be grounds for withholding seemingly harmless information on the basis that it may
assist terrorists when pieced together with other information.

If you use the exemption, you should be able to make a reasoned and convincing argument about the risks
of compliance with the UK GDPR provisions. You may base these on hypothetical scenarios, as long as they
are still realistic and credible.

For example, you may need to use the exemption to provide a consistent “neither confirm nor deny”
(NCND) response about whether you process data for national security purposes. This may even be in a
case where there is no direct impact on national security. This is so that nothing can be inferred in other
cases which might have more of an impact on national security.

You can apply this type of NCND response as a general policy. However, you should be able to make a
reasoned argument about its use and demonstrate it to the ICO, if required. You should still consider
whether there are any special circumstances which mean you don’t need to rely on the general NCND policy
in a particular case.

Instead of an NCND response, you could also give a different form of non-committal response. There may
be circumstances when it is not appropriate to inform a person that you are relying on the national security
exemption and you may wish to word your response appropriately.

Example

An organisation is concerned that some of its service users are at risk of radicalisation from extremist
groups. It passes details of individuals it considers may have been approached or are at risk to the
relevant authorities.

A group of service users make subject access requests to the organisation. They ask specific questions
about whether their details have ever been “passed to the authorities”. The service users have
announced publicly on social media that they intend to share their responses with each other.

The organisation has informed the relevant authorities about some members of the group of service
users, but not others. It is concerned that if radicalised individuals become aware that their details
have been shared, it may damage national security, put lives in danger and they may take steps to
thwart surveillance or other monitoring of their actions.

The organisation must respond to the subject access requests, but can use the exemption to avoid
revealing any information about whether or not it has referred details to relevant authorities. It can
omit the relevant details from the information it does provide. It can also provide a non-committal
response to any direct question about disclosures to the authorities, regardless of whether or not the
referral has in fact taken place.

Further reading — ICO guidance

The courts have considered a very similar exemption in the context of freedom of information requests.
For more information, see our guidance on the FOI exemption for safeguarding national security.

 

When is the exemption likely to apply?

You can use the exemption if you can show that complying with the relevant rule would be incompatible
with safeguarding national security.

You can also use the exemption to maintain a consistent line so that individuals cannot draw inferences
which might harm national security in other cases. For example, giving a non-committal response to
subject access requests about national security processing. You do not have to confirm that you are relying
on the exemption or give any details which allow an individual to infer that additional information is in fact
processed.

Example

792


--- New Page 354 ---
Page number: 354
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

A company is concerned that some of its customers may be using its products to make bombs. It
decides to provide MI5 with information about these customers and their purchases.

A customer makes a subject access request to the company for their personal data, along with details
of the processing. The company should comply with the usual UK GDPR rules on the right of access in
the normal way for the processing it does for its own business purposes. However, it is likely to be able
to use the national security and defence exemption to avoid giving any information about the
disclosures to MI5. In this case, alerting a suspected bomb-maker to the fact that MI5 is aware of their
activities would clearly raise a real risk to MI5’s ability to effectively safeguard national security.

If the customer makes a request for erasure of their data, the company can delete its ordinary
customer records as usual but rely on the exemption to avoid deleting the data shared with MI5. It
could also rely on the exemption to avoid informing the customer that it had not deleted all of the data.

You cannot use the exemption if the impact of compliance would be trivial or is not linked to national
security (eg to avoid embarrassment).

You cannot use the exemption in a blanket way just because you process data for national security
purposes. You must be able to show some link between compliance with the specific provision and the need
to safeguard national security, even if that link is indirect. If necessary, we would expect you to be able to
provide us with evidence about why you used this exemption.

What is a ministerial certificate?

Section 27 of the DPA says that a Minister of the Crown (specifically a member of the Cabinet, the Attorney
General or the Advocate General for Scotland) can sign a certificate which is conclusive evidence that the
exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.

It is important to remember that you do not require a certificate in order to rely on the national security
exemption. In fact, in most cases, controllers will determine for themselves whether they require an
exemption to safeguard national security. It is also important to note that there are no certificates for
relying on this exemption for defence purposes.

The exemption and the ministerial certificate do different things. The exemption, as detailed above, is
always available. You may properly apply it to safeguard national security, with or without a ministerial
certificate. Ministerial certificates are meant to give greater legal certainty that national security is
applicable for specified data processing. This is because it certifies that an exemption is required for
specified personal data to safeguard national security.

In this context, a ministerial certificate is admissible as conclusive evidence that exemption from the
specific provision listed in section 26 is required to safeguard national security.

These certificates can be issued in advance or retrospectively. The personal data to which the certificate
applies may be identified in general terms.

The ICO will publish some details of all national security certificates which have been issued, including the
text of the certificate where possible. However, there may be some cases where the text of the certificate is
sensitive and cannot be published. In these cases, we will publish the fact that a certificate was issued, the

793


--- New Page 355 ---
Page number: 355
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

date it was signed, and which minister signed it.

If a relevant certificate is in place, you can rely on it to demonstrate that the exemption applies. However,
you should still consider whether you actually need to rely on the exemption, and the certificate, in a
particular case. You may need to check with the relevant authorities whether or not you should rely on a
certificate.

If you consider that a certificate is required, you can apply to a Minister of the Crown to issue a national
security certificate under section 27. Details of the process for doing this are on the Home Office website,
and linked to from the National security certificate page of the ICO website.

 

For more information on ministerial certificates, see the Guide to intelligence services processing.

What are the special rules for special category data?

Section 28 of the DPA 2018 modifies the rules on special category data for the purpose of safeguarding
national security.

You may not always need to identify an Article 9 condition for that element of your processing as long as
you have “appropriate safeguards” in place to protect individuals’ rights and freedoms. This reflects the
substantial public interest in national security. However, you still need to ensure you have an Article 6
lawful basis for your processing.

The DPA does not specify how you can demonstrate that you have appropriate safeguards in place - so it is
your responsibility to identify a reasonable way to do so.

This document should briefly outline:

@ how you have met the lawfulness requirements of principle (a) — including which lawful basis you are
relying upon;

® your retention and deletion policies; and

® an indication of the retention period for the specific data.

If you already have an appropriate policy document for the processing of special category data, you may
wish to include the details about your security processing in it.

It is good practice to retain these details until six months after the date you stop this processing. You must
keep it under review. You do not have to publish it, although it is good practice to do so (although it may
not be appropriate to do so for national security reasons).

How are our security obligations affected?

794


--- New Page 356 ---
Page number: 356
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Section 28 also modifies the security obligations placed on a controller. So, slightly different security
obligations apply if you are processing for the purpose of safeguarding national security.

You must implement security measures appropriate to the risks arising from your processing. There are
also specific additional requirements for any electronic data. You must evaluate the risks, and implement
specific measures to:

@ prevent unauthorised processing or interference with your electronic systems;

® ensure that you can establish the details of any processing which takes place (ie there is an electronic
audit trail);

® ensure proper functioning and restoration of the system; and

@ ensure that data will not be corrupted if a system malfunctions.

What about law enforcement processing?

If you are a competent authority processing for law enforcement purposes, different rules apply under Part
3 of the DPA 2018.

There is no equivalent broad exemption to safeguard national security for law enforcement processing. The
usual principles and obligations apply. However, there are some restrictions built-in to some of the rights of
data subjects, and some of the provisions about reporting data breaches. These can apply where necessary
and proportionate to protect national security. A Minister can sign a certificate as conclusive evidence that
these restrictions apply, in a similar way to the UK GDPR exemption.

enforcement processing.

 

For more information on processing by the intelligence services themselves and the equivalent exemption
in Part 4 of the DPA 2018, see the Guide to intelligence services processing.

Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA

Appeal against an ET's ruling that the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of
contract and failure to pay notice pay were well founded. Appeal dismissed.

The Claimant was dismissed for gross misconduct (physical violence) after he grabbed a
colleague by the neck. He won his claims of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure
to pay notice pay. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Respondent
was not one that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. Further, the Tribunal found that no
reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper regard to all of the
circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to what is just and equitable in
all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the Claimant contributed to his own
dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent. The Respondent appealed.

The EAT dismissed the appeal. The Respondent had erred in not having regard to all of
the circumstances, including the Claimant's exemplary record. The EAT also ruled that
there was no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per cent.

**SUMMARY**
UNFAIR DISMISSAL - Reasonableness of dismissal

The Employment Tribunal found the Respondent's complaints of unfair dismissal and
breach of contract to be well founded. The Appellant's primary ground of appeal that the
Employment Tribunal substituted its own view for that of the Appellant failed, as did the
contention that the Employment Tribunal reached a perverse decision. The Employment
Tribunal misapplied the decision in [Ramphal v Department for Transport ]()[2015] IRLR
985 and it is not clear from the Decision whether the Employment Tribunal accepted that
physical violence amounted to gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's
disciplinary procedure. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed the unfair dismissal
appeal: physical violence amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary
procedures, but the Appellant failed to have regard to all the surrounding circumstances
and the Claimant's exemplary disciplinary record over 42 years. The appeal against the
breach of contract claim was also dismissed.

**THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SUPPERSTONE**

 

1. The Appellant, Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd, appeals against the Judgment of an
Employment Tribunal (Employment Judge Johnson), sent to the parties on 28
January 2016 following a hearing held at North Shields on 21 December 2015, that
the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure to pay
notice pay are well founded and succeed. Mr Morgan appears for the Appellant; the
Claimant is not represented or present, but he has submitted written
representations which we have read and taken into account.

1. The Appellant is primarily an automotive retailer, with over 200 branches throughout
the UK. The company also provides hire, drive and insurance services. Its services
generally include sales, service and bodyshop departments. It has approximately
10,000 employees and has a specific HR facility comprising 15 staff across offices
in Glasgow and Manchester. The Claimant worked at the Appellant's Penn Street,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne branch. He is a Motor Vehicle Technician with over 42 years’
continuous service with the Appellant.

1. The claims arise out of the Appellant's dismissal of the Claimant on 6 May 2015 for
reasons related to his conduct. The alleged conduct was physical violence towards
another employee. The Claimant had admitted grabbing the other employee but
denied any physical violence. The Appellant's disciplinary procedures that are
relevant to the Claimant's complaint include the following (as quoted at paragraph
3.5 of the Decision):

"1.0 Informal procedure

1.1 Minor shortcomings in meeting the requirements of your job will be brought to
your attention informally by the person to whom you are primarily responsible. If
however formal steps are necessary the following will apply.

2.0 Guidelines for the conduct of formal disciplinary meetings

2.1 Disciplinary action will normally be taken by the person to whom you report but
circumstances may warrant someone else being involved, for example where your
line manager is not available or he or she is involved in the complaint.

3.0 Implementation of the disciplinary policy

3.3 The persons conducting the interview will decide what (if any) disciplinary
measures to apply whilst taking into account the circumstances and your previous
record."

1. Section 4, headed "Disciplinary actions", sets out disciplinary sanctions that may be
imposed. Section 5, headed "Summary dismissal", states:

"5.1 You will normally be dismissed with immediate effect and without notice or
payment in lieu of notice in cases of gross misconduct. ..."

Examples of gross misconduct given include physical violence.

1. The Claimant reported directly to the Workshop Controller, John French, and the
Service Manager, Tom Middleton. The incident that formed the subject matter of the
disciplinary proceedings taken against the Claimant occurred on 27 April 2015
(paragraph 3.8):

"3.8. ... One of the apprentices, Kieran Chapman, was having some difficulty in
operating a printer in the computer room. The claimant thought he could identify the
problem and suggested that the paper drawer should be opened to see if the paper
had jammed. The claimant suggested that more paper should be put into the drawer.
Kieran insisted that extra paper was not required. The claimant momentarily lost his
temper, accused Kieran of not listening to him and, using both hands, grabbed
Kieran in the vicinity of his neck. The words used by Kieran in the investigation
were, "The next think [sic] | know he's got his hands round my neck". When asked
in the investigation how long the claimant had his hands round his neck, Kieran
replied, "Just a couple of seconds". Kieran then said, "I pushed him off and then he
told us to get my hands off him and | didn't have my hand on him like"."

1. When the Claimant was interviewed, he said that he may have caught his throat but
he did not have him by the throat. The following morning the Claimant approached
Mr Chapman and apologised to him for his actions. Mr Chapman had already
reported the incident to Mr Middleton. Later in the day both of them were called into
Mr Middleton's office. They went over the details of the incident. Mr Middleton
informed them that he had decided not to proceed with any formal disciplinary
action but that he intended to issue the Claimant with a "letter of concern”, in
accordance with the Appellant's informal procedure. The Claimant again apologised
to Mr Chapman, confirming that he knew that he was in the wrong and should not
have done what he had done. They shook hands and both returned to work.

1. On the same day a copy of the letter was sent by Mr French to Liz Kilshaw in the
Appellant's HR Department. In substance it read:

"Had some handbags between two guys here and we will be issuing David [the
Claimant] with this letter. A copy for your records."

1. The Tribunal found that the use of the word "handbags" is a local colloquialism for
something understood to be a petty and insignificant disagreement. When Ms
Kilshaw received Mr French's message and a copy of the letter of concern, she
spoke to Mr French and established that there had been an allegation of what she
considered to be physical violence, specifically that the Claimant was alleged to
have grabbed Mr Chapman by the throat. Ms Kilshaw decided that a formal
investigation was required. Having interviewed the Claimant, Mr Chapman and
other employees, Ms Kilshaw suspended the Claimant pending a formal disciplinary
hearing. A letter was sent to the Claimant on 30 April, which ends by stating:

"You should be aware that the company considers this to be a matter amounting to
gross misconduct and a potential outcome of this meeting is your dismissal without
notice."

1. The Claimant attended a disciplinary hearing on 6 May, which was conducted by
Laura Fowler of HR and Mr French. At the end of the disciplinary hearing, after a
short retirement, Ms Fowler said:

",.. So you have confirmed obviously that you grabbed Kieran by the kind of the
collar area which may have been perceived as the neck area. You are not too sure as
to why you lost your temper and obviously afterwards you've realised kind of what
you've done and apologised to Kieran. Based on the facts established throughout
the disciplinary meeting we have decided the outcome of today's meeting will be
dismissal without notice, ok. ... Just to clarify the reason why we've come to this
decision is the physical violence, we couldn't accept it of any nature at all within the
business. ... we deem any form of any physical violence as unacceptable ..."

1. Ms Fowler gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted at paragraph 3.21
of the Decision:

"3.21. ... Ms Fowler insisted that the claimant's length of service and previous good
character were not matters to which she should have any regard whatsoever. ..."

800

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

1. The Claimant had over 42 years’ continuous service with the Appellant, and
throughout that time he had an exemplary disciplinary record. Ms Fowler also
insisted that "as a matter of policy we cannot tolerate physical violence". She
insisted that the Appellant operates a "zero tolerance policy" towards physical
violence. The Judge noted that Ms Fowler further refused to acknowledge that
allegations such as these must be seen and taken in the context of all of the
surrounding circumstances at the relevant time. She did not consider it appropriate
to undertake any assessment as to the level or degree of physical violence.

1. The Claimant appealed the decision to dismiss him, and on 25 June Ms Louise
Pheasey, Senior HR Adviser, conducted an appeal hearing. After the hearing Ms
Pheasey undertook further interviews with two employees who had previously given
statements and Mr French. She then issued her letter dismissing the Claimant's
appeal on 9 July without referring back to the Claimant. She dismissed all of the
Claimant's grounds of appeal. In her letter dismissing the appeal she said:

",.. [uphold that this was classed as physical violence which is listed in the
company disciplinary procedure as an issue of gross misconduct and therefore the
outcome of summary dismissal on this basis was fair and reasonable in the
circumstances."

1. Ms Pheasey gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted that when asked
whether grabbing someone by the collar should be regarded as very much towards
the lower end of physical violence, she said she saw no reason to make any
differentiation. She too insisted that the Appellant operated a zero tolerance policy
towards any incident of physical violence and that any such incident would
inevitably result in Summary dismissal. She accepted that there may well be
circumstances where an employee involved in an act of physical violence will not be
dismissed but insisted that this case was not one of those. An example given was
where an employee reacted to provocation that amounted to sexual harassment or
racial discrimination. That was not this case, and, that being so, the surrounding
circumstances and the Claimant's record were not taken into account.

1. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Appellant was not one
that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. No attempt was made to discuss the
matter with Mr French and Mr Middleton, and in particular to obtain from them their
assessment as to the seriousness of the incident itself. Further, the Tribunal found
that no reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper
regard to all of the circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to
what is just and equitable in all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the
Claimant contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent.

1. Mr Morgan advances four grounds of appeal. The Appellant's primary ground is that
the Tribunal fell into error by impermissibly substituting its own view for that of the
Appellant or at the very least the Tribunal substituted the views of the other
managers, Mr French and Mr Middleton, who had considered the Claimant's

801


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

misconduct at an earlier stage. In support of the submission the Appellant pointed in
particular to four passages in the Judgment: first, at paragraph 12, the Judge stated:

"12. ... The Tribunal saw no evidence from the respondents [sic] to contradict their
original assessment of the incident as "handbags". ..."

1. Secondly, at paragraph 13 the Judge stated:

"13. ... The Tribunal found that the subsequent investigation, disciplinary and
appeal process were [sic] tainted by Ms Fowler's and Ms Pheasey's exaggerated
interpretation of the facts. ..."

1. Thirdly, at paragraph 14 the Judge stated:

"14. ... Whilst some may consider it offensive, it could reasonably only be
categorised as mildly so. ..."

1. Fourthly, at paragraph 3.26 the Judge said:

"3.26. ... When asked whether she had taken into account the claimant's length of
service and good record, Ms Pheasey somewhat alarmingly said that she had done
so..."

1. We do not accept that the Tribunal substituted its own views for those of the
Appellant's decision makers. Paragraph 14 of the Judgment makes it clear, in our
view, that it was the decision of Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey that the Tribunal
subjected to scrutiny and analysis, correctly applying the "no reasonable employer"
test.

1. The second ground of appeal is that the Tribunal misdirected itself in applying the
guidance of this Tribunal set out in the case of Ramphal v Department for
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 when considering the role of Human Resources in the
Appellant's disciplinary process. At paragraph 13 of the Decision it is stated:

"13. The Tribunal found that this was one of those cases where the HR officers
involved had unreasonably and improperly imposed their own assumptions and
Opinions, in circumstances where their involvement was, in the view of those best
placed to decide, simply not required. ..."

1. We agree with Mr Morgan that this is a misapplication of the Ramphal decision, the
essence of which the Tribunal correctly records at paragraph 8 of its Judgment. Ms
Fowler and Ms Pheasey were the actual decision makers in this case. Accordingly,
the principle enunciated in Ramphal has no application to the facts of the present
case.

1. The third ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as to
whether the Claimant's behaviour amounted to gross misconduct or not. It is said
that at paragraphs 14 and 15 the Tribunal conflated its findings on the scale of the
act of misconduct (physical violence) on the one hand with its apparent view of the
mitigating circumstances (apology, risk to others, stressful circumstances, previous
employment record) on the other. Applying the Meek v City of Birmingham District
Council [1987] IRLR 250 test, it is said that the Appellant does not know why it lost

 

802

the case. There is, we think, some force in this criticism. The Tribunal found at
paragraph 16 of the Decision that this was a minor, trivial incident that could not
reasonably be categorised as the fundamental breach of contract by the Claimant.
Admittedly, this was said in the context of considering the breach of contract claim;
however, it is not clear from what is said at paragraphs 14 to 16 read as a whole
whether the Tribunal is accepting the physical violence in this case amounts to
gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.

1. Finally, the Appellant contends that the Tribunal acted perversely in that this was a
decision that no reasonable Tribunal properly directing itself on the law could have
reached. We do not accept that the Tribunal reached a perverse decision, for the
reasons that we shall explain. At the conclusion of the oral submissions we invited
Mr Morgan to address us on disposal of the appeal if we concluded (1) that he had
satisfied us that there were errors in the Tribunal Judgment, (2) that we were of the
view that there was gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure,
but (3) we were of the view that the dismissal was unfair because the Appellant had
proceeded on the basis of a zero tolerance policy and had not taken into account all
of the circumstances including the Claimant's employment record. Mr Morgan
acknowledged that if that was our view we would be entitled to deal with the appeal
without the need for remission to an Employment Tribunal.

1. We have reached the conclusion that there are errors in the Tribunal Decision that
we have identified. We are further of the view that there was physical violence that
amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.
However, it is clear to us that Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey proceeded on the basis
that in this case because there was gross misconduct the Claimant was to be
dismissed. There was no evidence that the Appellant did operate a zero tolerance
policy towards physical violence. Indeed, the Appellant's disciplinary procedure is
expressly stated in terms to the contrary. The use of the word "normally" in
paragraph 5.1 indicates that the Appellant has a discretion to exercise. In our
judgment, the Appellant erred in not having regard to all of the circumstances,
including the Claimant's exemplary record. We are satisfied, having regard to the
findings made by the Tribunal, which are not challenged, that by reason of the
Appellant's failure to have regard to all of the surrounding circumstances the
dismissal of the Claimant was unfair.

1. In the alternative, the Appellant contends that the Claimant contributed 100 per cent
to his own dismissal and that in deciding that he only contributed to his dismissal to
the extent of 50 per cent the Tribunal acted perversely. We reject this submission.
There is, in our view, no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per
cent.

1. For the reasons we have given, this appeal is dismissed; both the appeal in relation
to the finding of unfair dismissal and in relation to the breach of contract claim.

Arnold Clark
Automobiles Ltd v Spoor
— dismissal of employee
for physical violence
against a colleague was
unfair

805

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

 

In the case of Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (“EAT”) held that the Employment Tribunal had not erred in finding that the dismissal
of an employee for physical violence against another employee was unfair, as there was no error
of law in the Tribunal’s decision.

Mr Spoor commenced employment with Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd (“Arnold Clark”) in
1973 and was, at the times relevant to this case, a Motor Vehicle Technician.

On 27 April 2015 Mr Spoor momentarily lost his temper with a colleague over a minor issue and
placed his hands on the colleague’s neck for a couple of seconds. This incident was reported by
the colleague to his line manager, Mr French and Mr Spoor was interviewed by Mr French. In this
interview Mr Spoor admitted that he may have caught his colleague’s throat but contended that
he had not grabbed his colleague by the throat. On 28 April 2015 Mr Spoor approached his
colleague to apologise for his actions and, later in the day, both Mr Spoor and his colleague were
called by Mr Middleton (the Service Manager) to a meeting to discuss the incident. Mr Middleton
informed Mr Spoor that he had decided not to take any formal disciplinary action regarding the
incident but that he intended to issue Mr Spoor with a “letter of concern”, in line with Arnold

806

Page number: 11
Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

Clark’s informal procedure. Mr Spoor again apologised to his colleague and confirmed that he
knew that he was in the wrong and should not have done what he did. Mr Spoor and his
colleague shook hands and they both returned to work.

On 28 April 2015 Mr French sent a copy of the “letter of concern” to Ms Kilshaw (Human
Resources). Mr French confirmed that there had been “some handbags”, that a copy of the “letter
of concern” would be issued to Mr Spoor, and that he was sending this to Ms Kilshaw for her
records. Upon the receipt of Mr French’s email Ms Kilshaw became concerned that there had
been an incident of physical violence, and decided that a formal investigation of the incident
was required. Ms Kilshaw therefore interviewed Mr Spoor, Mr Chapman, and other colleagues,
and suspended Mr Spoor pending a formal disciplinary hearing. On 30 April 2015 Ms Kilshaw
sent Mr Spoor a letter stating that an outcome of the hearing may be dismissal.

On 6 May 2015 Mr Spoor attended a hearing. Mr French and Ms Fowler (Human Resources) also
attended the hearing. At the end of the hearing Ms Fowler confirmed that Mr Spoor would be
dismissed for gross misconduct as “...we deem any form of physical violence as unacceptable...”.
She also stated that the company had a “zero tolerance policy” to physical violence and did not
consider it appropriate to undertake a review of the context of the incident, including Mr Spoor’s
length of service (42 years), his exemplary disciplinary record, and the level or degree of physical
violence.

Mr Spoor appealed the decision to dismiss him but this was rejected. Mr Spoor made a claim to
the Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal, and this came to a full
hearing on 21 December 2015. The Employment Tribunal found that the investigation
undertaken by Arnold Clark was not reasonable in the circumstances as no attempt was made to
discuss the matter with Mr French or Middleton and, in particular, to obtain their view of the
seriousness of the incident. Further, the Tribunal also found that no reasonable employer would
have dismissed in the circumstances, having proper regard to all of the circumstances including
his length of service and previous record. The Tribunal did, however, find that Mr Spoor
contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 percent.

Arnold Clark appealed against this decision on four grounds, including that the Tribunal had
impermissibly substituted its own view for that of Arnold Clark (“the First Ground”), that the
Tribunal had misdirected itself by applying the guidance in the case of Ramphal v Department of
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 (“the Second Ground”), that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as
to whether Mr Spoor’s behaviour constituted gross misconduct (“the Third Ground”), and that
the Tribunal had acted perversely as this was not a decision that any reasonable Tribunal
properly directly itself on the law could have reached (“the Fourth Ground”).

The Employment Appeal Tribunal rejected the First Ground and Fourth Grounds of appeal but
found that Arnold Clark’s appeals on the Second Ground Third Ground had some merit, as,
respectively, Ramphal was not applicable in the circumstances and the Tribunal had failed to
give specific reasons as to whether they had found Mr Spoor’s behaviour to be gross misconduct
under Arnold Clark’s disciplinary policy. However, the EAT found that the merits of these grounds
of appeal were not sufficient to merit the upholding of the appeal, as the EAT were satisfied that
Arnold Clark had failed to take into account all the circumstances (including Mr Spoor’s
exemplary service and the seriousness of the incident) when reaching its decision to dismiss.

807

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

The EAT also dismissed an argument that Mr Spoor had contributed to his own dismissal to the
extent of 100 percent.

The EAT therefore rejected Arnold Clark’s appeal.

Chris Hadrill, a specialist employment solicitor at Redmans, commented on the case: “This case
shows that employers must carefully apply their disciplinary policy and take into account all of
the circumstances of the case before making any decision to dismiss - a failure to do so may
render any decision to dismiss unfair.”

Below are 20 articles that highlight the importance of modularity in software engineering,
each explained with an analogy:

1. The Lego Brick Approach: Building Software with Modularity
(https://www.csuohio.edu/sites/default/files/98B-The%20Advantages%20of
%20Modular%20Design%20in%20Software%20Engineering.pdf) by Martin Fowler:

 

¢ Analogy: Imagine building with Lego bricks. Each brick represents a small,
well-defined module. You can combine these modules to create complex
structures (software features) efficiently and flexibly. Just like adding or
replacing Lego bricks, modular software allows easy modification of specific
functionalities.

2. The Modular Kitchen: A Recipe for Maintainable Software
(https://medium.com/@scott.waring/use-modular-programming-to-improve-your-
code-and-life-5a25c98feaaQ) by Faizan Iqbal:

¢ Analogy: Think of a modular kitchen. Each section (cabinets, drawers,
appliances) acts as a module. This allows customization (adding new
features) and easier repairs (fixing isolated modules). Similarly, modular
software enables adding new functionalities or fixing specific bugs without
affecting the entire system.

3. The Orchestra Performance: Symphony of Modules in Software
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modular-approach-in-programming/) by
GeeksforGeeks:

 

¢ Analogy: Imagine an orchestra. Each instrument (module) plays its part,
contributing to the overall symphony (software functionality). Musicians can
be replaced or added without affecting the entire piece. Similarly, modular
software allows swapping or adding functionalities without disrupting the core
system.

4. The IKEA Furniture Guide: Assembling Maintainable Software
(https://www.programiz.com/blog/tools-we-use-at-programiz/) by Programiz:

 

¢ Analogy: Consider assembling IKEA furniture. Each well-defined piece
(module) with clear instructions simplifies the overall construction. Similarly,
modular software with clear interfaces between modules makes
development, testing, and maintenance easier.

5. The Cityscape Analogy: Building Scalable Software with Modularity
(http://gwentechembedded.com/the-advantages-of-modular-software-and-

programming/) by Wrox:

¢ Analogy: Imagine a city. Each district (module) has its own infrastructure and
functions (Services). The city can expand by adding new districts (modules)
without affecting existing ones. Likewise, modular software allows adding

809

new functionalities without impacting existing features, making the system
scalable.

6. The Jigsaw Puzzle: Putting the Pieces Together with Modularity
(https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/modular-programming-principle/) by JournalDev:

¢ Analogy: Think of a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece (module) contributes to the
final image (software functionality). Just like replacing incorrect puzzle
pieces, modular software allows isolating and fixing malfunctioning modules.

7. The Fast Food Restaurant: Modular Design for Efficient Software
Development ([invalid URL removed]) by Tutorialspoint:

¢ Analogy: Consider a fast-food restaurant. Each station (module) prepares a
specific ingredient (functionality). This allows parallel work (independent
module development) and customization (adding or removing stations).
Similarly, modular software facilitates concurrent development and flexible
feature addition/removal.

8. The Human Body: A Perfect Example of Modular Design
(https://appunite.com/blog/modular-software-design-mistakes) by SourceMaking:

 

¢ Analogy: The human body is a perfect example of modular design. Each
organ (module) has its specific function, yet works together for the whole.
Similar to the body, modular software allows independent development of
functionalities while ensuring smooth overall operation.

9. The Ship's Crew: Teamwork and Modularity in Software Development

(https:/Awww.myemssolutions.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-modular-
design-for-electronics-products/) by Educative:

¢ Analogy: Imagine a ship's crew. Each team member (module) has a specific
role (functionality). They collaborate (modules interact) to ensure smooth
sailing (Software operation). Modular software promotes teamwork through
independent module development and clear communication between
modules.

10.The Platformer Game: Building Blocks for Modular Software Design
(https://www.csuohio.edu/sites/default/files/98B-The%20Advantages%20of
%20Modular%20Design%20in%20Software%20Engineering.pdf) by
freeCodeCamp:

¢ Analogy: Consider a platformer game. Each level (module) has its own challenges
and objectives. Combining these modules creates a complete game experience.
Similarly, modular software allows for independent development and testing of
functionalities that can be combined to form the final software product.

Analysis of the Use of a Modular Approach in Software Engineering Across
Software Engineering Books

1.

- Discusses different design approaches for software architecture, mentioning that an application doesn't need to stick with a single
architecture and can mix different design approaches, implying a modular design.

- Highlights the decomposition process in the V-Model, aligning with modular design principles by breaking the application down into
manageable pieces.

In the book "Beginning Software Engineering,” the concept of a modular approach, while not explicitly labeled as "modular approach,” is
discussed in the context of software architecture and design. Here are the relevant sections:

High-Level Design (Page 100): The book discusses different design approaches for software architecture. It mentions that an
application doesn't need to stick with a single architecture and can mix different design approaches. Specifically, it states, "Some of the
larger services might use a component-based approach to break their code into decoupled pieces." This is a principle of modular design,
where software is divided into separate modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

V-Model (Page 275): In the context of the V-Model, the book discusses decomposition, which is the process of breaking the application
down from its highest conceptual level into more and more detailed tasks. This concept aligns with modular design as it involves dividing
software into smaller, manageable pieces.

Although the term "modular approach" is not used directly, the principles of modular design are implied in the discussions of component-
based approaches and the decomposition process. The book emphasizes the importance of breaking down software into manageable,
decoupled pieces, which is a core aspect of modular design.

2. "Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Fourth Edition" by Rajib Mall:

- Explicitly discusses modularity, stating that a modular design effectively decomposes a problem into a set of modules with limited
interactions.

- Emphasizes the importance of high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules as characteristics of a highly
modular design solution.

- Advocates for modular design to improve understandability, reusability, and manageability of software.

In the book "Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Fourth Edition" by Rajib Mall, the modular approach is explicitly discussed in several
sections:

Definition of Module (Page 65): The book defines a module as "a collection of procedures and data structures... forming an
independently compilable unit" that can be linked with other modules to form a complete application. This definition underlines the
concept of modularity in software engineering.

Modularity and Design (Page 627): The book elaborates on the concepts of modularity, stating that "A modular design is an effective
decomposition of a problem" and is a key characteristic of good design. It explains that modularity involves decomposing a problem into
modules with limited interactions, which simplifies understanding and reduces complexity.

Measuring Modularity (Page 628): It discusses the difficulty in quantitatively measuring the modularity of a design but suggests that a
design can be considered highly modular if it exhibits high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules.

Advantages of Modular Design (Page 634): The text outlines the benefits of modular design, including reusability, understandability,
and reduced complexity, by ensuring that modules are functionally independent.

Layered Design and Modularity (Page 646): It mentions that a layered design, which is a form of modular design, achieves control
abstraction and simplifies understanding and debugging.

Assessment and Improvement of Modularity (Page 672): The book poses questions regarding the assessment of modularity in design,
factors affecting modularity, and ways to improve designs with low cohesion and high coupling.

Function-Oriented Design and Modularity (Page 675): It discusses how top-down decomposition in function-oriented design leads to a
modular structure that embodies good design characteristics.

Integration Testing and Modularity (Pages 1213, 1214, 1217): The book explains how integration testing strategies, such as the big-
bang, bottom-up, and mixed approaches, relate to the modular structure of software systems.

These sections collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its
importance, implementation, and benefits in the context of design and testing.

 

 

3. "Introduction to Software Engineering":

- Describes how the development of the Linux operating system benefits from modularity, with each source code module being
reviewed by many programmers.

- Discusses the importance of modular requirements for the flexibility of design and code development.

- Explains different approaches to software integration (big bang, bottom-up, and top-down) and their relation to modularity.

In the book "Introduction to Software Engineering," the modular approach is discussed in various contexts:
Open Source Development and Modularity (Page 207): The book describes how the development of the Linux operating system
benefits from modularity, as each source code module is reviewed by many programmers, which enhances the quality and maintainability

of the code.

Requirements and Modularity (Page 331): It discusses how having modular requirements allows for the design and code to be
developed in a modular manner, which adds flexibility and makes it easier to incorporate new requirements with minimal changes.

Software Integration Approaches (Pages 851, 853, 854, 855, 857): The text explains different approaches to software integration (big
bang, bottom-up, and top-down) and how they relate to modularity. The big bang approach, for example, is more feasible if the system
design is sufficiently modular, allowing individual software components to adhere to appropriate interface and performance standards.

Advocacy for Higher Modularity (Page 866): The book advocates for a higher degree of modularity, especially in software that
combines procedural and object-oriented portions, to simplify integration and maintenance.

Hybrid Integration Approach (Page 909): It describes a hybrid approach to software integration that combines top-down and bottom-up
techniques, which relies on the modularity of the system to be effective.

References to Modularity Research (Page 1102): The book cites works by D.L. Parnas, a pioneer in software engineering, who has
written extensively on the modular structure of complex systems, highlighting the importance of modularity in software design.

These sections collectively underscore the importance of the modular approach in software engineering, particularly in terms of system
integration, flexibility in design, and the ability to handle changes effectively.

 

 

4. "Software Engineering, 10th Edition":

- Mentions the incremental approach to software development, which implies the need for a modular approach to maintain the system's
structure.

- Discusses Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and service-oriented approaches, highlighting the move towards more
modular systems.

- Emphasizes the importance of architectural design in successful reuse, focusing on the selection and integration of individual
components into the system architecture.

In "Software Engineering, 10th Edition," the modular approach is discussed indirectly through various software engineering practices and
principles:

Incremental Approach and Structural Degradation (Page 112): The book mentions the incremental approach to software development,
which can lead to structural degradation and code messiness as new increments are added. This implies the need for a modular
approach to maintain the system's structure and manageability.

Agile Methods and Plan-Driven Development (Page 164): While not directly mentioning modularity, the discussion contrasts agile
methods with plan-driven approaches, highlighting the challenges of applying heavyweight, plan-driven development to smaller systems.
This suggests the importance of adaptability and modularity in software development practices.

Components and Component Models (Page 1103): The book discusses Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and service-

oriented approaches, which replace traditional embedded components. This section highlights the move towards more modular, service-
oriented systems in software development.

Architectural Design and Reuse (Page 1130): It emphasizes the importance of architectural design in successful reuse, which involves
identifying and validating components for reuse. This process is inherently modular, focusing on the selection and integration of individual
components into the system architecture.

Systems of Systems (SoS) and Architectural Frameworks (Page 1442): The text discusses the architectural design of systems of
systems (SoS) and the use of architectural frameworks. These frameworks support the development of complex systems by promoting a
modular approach, where the system is viewed as a collection of interconnected components.

While the term "modular approach" is not explicitly used, the principles of modularity underpin many of the discussed concepts, such as
incremental development, component-based engineering, and the architectural design of complex systems.

 

 

5. "Software Engineering: Modern Approaches":
- Highlights that software should be modular, facilitating easier planning, development, modification, documentation, and testing.
- Lists modularity as one of the principal goals of software design, involving dividing the software into well-defined parts.
- Discusses the importance of decomposing software into modules that maximize cohesion and minimize coupling.
- Advocates for incremental integration over big bang integration, emphasizing the modular assembly of software systems.

In "Software Engineering: Modern Approaches," the modular approach is discussed in several contexts:

Design Simplification and Modularity (Page 842): The book emphasizes that software should be modular, allowing parts to be replaced
without affecting others, facilitating easier planning, development, modification, documentation, and testing. It also highlights that
modularity enables assigning different people to work on different parts of the software.

Principles of Software Design (Pages 842-843): Modularity is listed as one of the principal goals of software design, alongside
sufficiency, understandability, cohesion, coupling, robustness, flexibility, reusability, information hiding, efficiency, and reliability. The book

explains that modularity involves dividing the software into well-defined parts.

Software Decomposition (Page 844): The text discusses the importance of decomposing software into modules that maximize
cohesion within each module and minimize coupling between modules. This approach helps simplify complex tasks.

Good Design and Modularization (Page 1329): It states that good design requires modularization, which should ideally be performed in
advance but can also be beneficial when done after the fact. The book mentions the Facade design pattern as a means of handling
modularity on a larger scale.

Integration Strategies (Pages 1414-1416): The book contrasts big bang integration with incremental integration, advocating for the
latter as it allows for the system to be built step by step in small increments, making it easier to isolate integration problems.

Summary of Integration (Page 1439): It summarizes the integration process, emphasizing the advantages of incremental integration
over big bang integration and highlighting the use of the Facade design pattern to facilitate interface testing between modules.

These sections collectively provide a comprehensive view of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its importance in
design, development, and integration processes. The book underscores the benefits of modularity in terms of simplification,
understandability, and maintainability of software systems.

 

 

Overall, these ebooks collectively underscore the significance of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its benefits
in terms of design simplicity, maintainability, and flexibility. The modular approach is presented as a fundamental principle across different
aspects of software development, from architectural design to integration strategies.

application. Some of the larger services might use a component-based approach to break their code into
decoupled pieces. Other services might use a multitier approach to separate their features from the data
storage layer. (Combining different architectures can also sound impressive at cocktail parties. “Yes, we
decided to go with an event-driven multitier approach using rule-based distributed components.”)

CLASSYDRAW ARCHITECTURE

 

Suppose you want to pick an architecture for the ClassyDraw application described
in Chapter 4. (Recall that this is a drawing program somewhat similar to MS Paint
except it lets you select and manipulate drawing objects.) One way to do that is to
think about each of the standard architectures and decide whether it would make
sense to use while building the program.

1. Monolithic—This is basically the default if none of the more elaborate archi-
tectures apply. We'll come back to this one later.

2.  Client/server, multitier—ClassyDraw stores drawings in files, not a database,
so client/server and multitier architectures aren’t needed. (You could store
drawings in a database if you wanted to, perhaps for an architectural frm
or some other use where there would be some benefit. For a simple drawing
application, it would be overkill.)

3. Component-based—Y ou could think of different pieces of the application as
components providing services to each other. For example, you could think of
a “rectangle component” that draws a rectangle. For this simple application,
it’s probably just as easy to think of a Rectangle class that draws a rectangle,
so I’m not going to think of this as a component-based approach.

4. — Service-oriented—This is even less applicable than the component-based approach.
PP P PP
Spreading the application across multiple computers connected via web services
(or some other kind of service) wouldn't help a simple drawing application.

5. Data-centric—The user defines the drawings, so there’s no data around which
to organize the program. (Although a more specialized program, perhaps a
drafting program for an architectural firm or an aerospace design program,
might interact with data in a meaningful way.)

6.  Event-driven—The user interface will be event-driven. For example, the user
selects a tool and then clicks and drags to create a new shape.

7. Rule-based—There are no rules that the user must follow to make a drawing,
so this program isn’t rule-based.

8. Distributed—This program doesn’t perform extensive calculations, so distrib-
uting pieces across multiple CPUs or cores probably wouldn't help.

Because none of the more exotic architectures applied (such as multitier or service-

oriented), this application can have a simple monolithic architecture with an event-
driven user interface.

V-model | 275

 

Figure 12-4 and Figure 12-5 show projects that use three increments, but you can use as many
as you like. In fact, for an application with a long useful life, you could use an open-ended series
of increments. You would just keep adding new increments whenever you wanted to make a new
version of the application to add new features.

REFACTORING REQUIRED

 

Sometimes, programs that grow incrementally become strange creatures with
illogical interfaces, inconsistent mechanisms, and code as strange as anything
H.P. Lovecraft could have written (if he’d been a programmer). I’ve worked
with programs that had been used and modified for decades, and it was nearly
impossible to make any significant changes without breaking something.

At some point, you may need to slip in a refactoring increment to clean house. That
increment might add little or no new functionality, but it will let you move forward
with future increments more efficiently.

The incremental waterfall model is actually somewhat adaptive because it lets you reevaluate your
direction at the start of each increment, but I’ve included it in this chapter for three reasons. First,
this is a waterfall variation, so | want to put it with the other waterfall models.

Second, it’s not all that adaptive. You can change direction when you start a new increment, but
within each increment the model runs predictively. You can make only small changes allowed
by whichever particular waterfall model you use for the increments (waterfall with feedback or
sashimi).

The fact that you’re building on a previous increment also gives the project some inertia that limits
the amount of change you can add to the next release. For example, you can add, remove, and
tweak features in a new increment, but you probably shouldn’t radically change the user interface.
That would be more like a completely new project rather than an incremental change to the ongoing
series.

Finally, increments tend to run over a longer scale than the stages in most adaptive models. For
example, a long-running project might use a new increment every year or two. That gives the users
a nice, steady, predictable release schedule. In contrast, some adaptive models produce new builds
of an application every month or even every week. You probably wouldn’t release all of those builds
to the users, but the pace is definitely more frenetic. The incremental waterfall model is somewhat
adaptive, but usually over long timescales.

V-MODEL

V-model is basically a waterfall that’s been bent into a V shape, as shown in Figure 12-6.

The tasks on the left side of the V break the application down from its highest conceptual level into

more and more detailed tasks. This process of breaking the application down into pieces that you
can implement is called decomposition.

1 In this text, we shall use the terms module and module structure to loosely mean the folowing—A module is a

collection of procedures and data structures. The data structures mn a module are accessible only to the procedures
defined inside the module. A module forms an independently compilable unit and may be linked to other modules to
form a complete application. The term module structure will be used to denote the way in which different modules
invoke each other’s procedures.

characteristics to be easily understandable:

e It should assign consistent and meaningful names to various design
components.

e It should make use of the principles of decomposition and abstraction
in good measures to simplify the design.

We had discussed the essential concepts behind the principles of
abstraction and decomposition principles in Chapter 1. But, how can the
abstraction and decomposition principles are used in arriving at a design
solution? These two principles are exploited by design methodologies to
make a design modular and layered. (Though there are also a few other
forms in which the abstraction and decomposition principles can be used in
the design solution, we discuss those later). We can now define the
characteristics of an easily understandable design as follows: A design
solution is understandable, if it is modular and the modules are arranged in
distinct layers.

 

A design solution should be modular and layered to be understandable.
We now elaborate the concepts of modularity and layering of modules:

 

Modularity

A modular design is an effective decomposition of a problem. It is a basic
characteristic of any good design solution. A modular design, in simple
words, implies that the problem has been decomposed into a set of
modules that have only limited interactions with each other.
Decomposition of a problem into modules facilitates taking advantage
of the divide and conquer principle. If different modules have either no
interactions or little interactions with each other, then each module can
be understood separately. This reduces the perceived complexity of the
design solution greatly. To understand why this is so, remember that it
may be very difficult to break a bunch of sticks which have been tied
together, but very easy to break the sticks individually.

It is not difficult to argue that modularity is an important characteristic of a
good design solution. But, even with this, how can we compare the
modularity of two alternate design solutions? From an inspection of the
module structure, it is at least possible to intuitively form an idea as to which
design is more modular For example, consider two alternate design solutions

to a problem that are represented in Figure 5.2, in which the modules M1 ,
M2 etc. have been drawn as rectangles. The invocation of a module by
another module has been shown as an arrow. It can easily be seen that the
design solution of Figure 5.2(a) would be easier to understand since the
interactions among the different modules is low. But, can we quantitatively
measure the modularity of a design solution? Unless we are able to
quantitatively measure the modularity of a design solution, it will be hard to
say which design solution is more modular than another. Unfortunately, there
are no quantitative metrics available yet to directly measure the modularity
of a design. However, we can quantitatively characterise the modularity of a
design solution based on the cohesion and coupling existing in the design.

 

A design solution is said to be highly modular, if the different modules in the solution
have high cohesion and their inter-module couplings are low.

 

A software design with high cohesion and low coupling among modules is
the effective problem decomposition we discussed in Chapter 1. Such a
design would lead to increased productivity during program development by
bringing down the perceived problem complexity.

Figure 5.2: Two design solutions to the same problem.

Based on this classification, we would be able to easily judge the cohesion
and coupling existing in a design solution. From a knowledge of the cohesion
and coupling in a design, we can form our own opinion about the modularity
of the design solution. We shall define the concepts of cohesion and coupling
and the various classes of cohesion and coupling in Section 5.3. Let us now
discuss the other important characteristic of a good design solution—layered

of shared data, the modules are tightly coupled.

e If the interactions occur through some shared data, then also we say
that they are highly coupled.

If two modules either do not interact with each other at all or at best
interact by passing no data or only a few primitive data items, they are said
to have low coupling.

Cohesion: To understand cohesion, let us first understand an analogy.
Suppose you listened to a talk by some speaker. You would call the speech to
be cohesive, if all the sentences of the speech played some role in giving the
talk a single and focused theme. Now, we can extend this to a module in a
design solution. When the functions of the module co-operate with each other
for performing a single objective, then the module has good cohesion. If the
functions of the module do very different things and do not co-operate with
each other to perform a single piece of work, then the module has very poor
cohesion.

Functional independence

By the term functional independence, we mean that a module performs a
single task and needs very little interaction with other modules.

 

A module that is highly cohesive and also has low coupling with other modules is said
to be functionally independent of the other modules.

Functional independence is a key to any good design primarily due to the
following advantages it offers:

Error isolation: Whenever an error exists in a module, functional
independence reduces the chances of the error propagating to the other
modules. The reason behind this is that if a module is functionally
independent, its interaction with other modules is low. Therefore, an error
existing in the module is very unlikely to affect the functioning of other
modules.

Further, once a failure is detected, error isolation makes it very easy to
locate the error On the other hand, when a module is not functionally
independent, once a failure is detected in a functionality provided by the
module, the error can be potentially in any of the large number of modules
and propagated to the functioning of the module.

Scope of reuse: Reuse of a module for the development of other
applications becomes easier. The reasons for this is as follows. A functionally

tested in another module.

Common coupling: Two modules are common coupled, if they share some
global data items.

Content coupling: Content coupling exists between two modules, if they
share code. That is, a jump from one module into the code of another module
can occur Modern high-level programming languages such as C do not
support such jumps across modules.

The different types of coupling are shown schematically in Figure 5.5. The
degree of coupling increases from data coupling to content coupling. High
coupling among modules not only makes a design solution difficult to
understand and maintain, but it also increases development effort and also
makes it very difficult to get these modules developed independently by
different team members.

5.4 LAYERED ARRANGEMENT OF MODULES

Thecontrol hierarchyrepresents the organisation of program
components in terms of their call relationships. Thus we can say that
the control hierarchy of a design is determined by the order in which
different modules call each other. Many different types of notations
have been used to represent the control hierarchy. The most common
notation is a tree-like diagram known as a structure chart which we
shall study in some detail in Chapter 6. However, other notations such
as Warnier-Orr [1977, 1981] or Jackson diagrams [1975] may also be
used. Since, Warnier-Orr and Jackson’s notations are not widely used
nowadays, we shall discuss only structure charts in this text.

In a layered design solution, the modules are arranged into several layers
based on their call relationships. A module is allowed to call only the modules
that are at a lower layer. That is, a module should not call a module that is
either at a higher layer or even in the same layer. Figure 5.6(a) shows a
layered design, whereas Figure 5.6(b) shows a design that is not layered.
Observe that the design solution shown in Figure 5.6(b), is actually not
layered since all the modules can be considered to be in the same layer. In
the following, we state the significance of a layered design and subsequently
we explain it.

function that the system needs to perform is analysed and hierarchically
decomposed into more detailed functions. On the other hand, during
structured design, all functions identified during structured analysis are
mapped to a module structure. This module structure is also called the high-
level design or the software architecture for the given problem. This is
represented using a structure chart.

The high-level design stage is normally followed by a detailed design stage.
During the detailed design stage, the algorithms and data structures for the
individual modules are designed. The detailed design can directly be
implemented as a working system using a conventional programming
language.

 

It is important to understand that the purpose of structured analysis is to capture the
detailed structure of the system as perceived by the user, whereas the purpose of
structured design is to define the structure of the solution that is suitable for
implementation in some programming language.

 

The results of structured analysis can therefore, be easily understood by
the user. In fact, the different functions and data in structured analysis are
named using the user's terminology. The user can therefore even review the
results of the structured analysis to ensure that it captures all his
requirements.

In the following section, we first discuss how to carry out structured
analysis to construct the DFD model. Subsequently, we discuss how the DFD
model can be transformed into structured design.

6.2 STRUCTURED ANALYSIS

We have already mentioned that during structured analysis, the major

processing tasks (high-level functions) of the system are analysed, and
thedata flow among these processing tasks are represented
graphically. Significant contributions to the development of the
structured analysis techniques have been made by Gane and Sarson
[1979], and DeMarco and Yourdon [1978]. The structured analysis
technique is based on the following underlying principles:

e Top-down decomposition approach.

e Application of divide and conquer principle. Through this each high-
level function is independently decomposed into detailed functions.

e Graphical representation ofthe analysis results usingdata flow

present in procedural programs. Therefore additional test cases are
needed to be designed to detect these. We examine these issues as
well as some other basic issues in testing object-oriented programs in
the following subsections.

10.11.1 What is a Suitable Unit for Testing

Object-oriented Programs?

For procedural programs, we had seen that procedures are the basic units of
testing. That is, first all the procedures are unit tested. Then various tested
procedures are integrated together and tested. Thus, as far as procedural
programs are concerned, procedures are the basic units of testing. Since
methods in an object-oriented program are analogous to procedures in a
procedural program, can we then consider the methods of object-oriented
programs as the basic unit of testing? Weyuker studied this issue and
postulated his anticomposition axiom as follows:

 

Adequate testing of individual methods does not ensure that a dass has been
satisfactorily tested.

The main intuitive justification for the anticomposition axiom is the
following. A method operates in the scope of the data and other methods of
its object. That is, all the methods share the data of the class. Therefore, it is
necessary to test a method in the context of these. Moreover, objects can
have significant number of states. The behaviour of a method can be different
based on the state of the corresponding object. Therefore, it is not enough to
test all the methods and check whether they can be integrated satisfactorily.
A method has to be tested with all the other methods and data of the
corresponding object. Moreover, a method needs to be tested at all the
states that the object can assume. As a result, it is improper to consider a
method as the basic unit of testing an object-oriented program.

 

 

An object is the basic unit of testing of object-oriented programs. |

 

Thus, in an object oriented program, unit testing would mean testing each
object in isolation. During integration testing (called cluster testing in the
object-oriented testing literature) various unit tested objects are integrated
and tested. Finally, system-level testing is carried out.

any special system constraints, such as the system having a real-time response to certain
inputs; unusual features of the project, such as being the first time that a new technology,
programming language, or software development environment is used; any interoperable
software systems that may impact the cost of the software; and, of course, the cost of the
software itself. In many organizations, the baseline information may be broken down into
the cost of different subsystems.

The determination of “similarity” or “sameness” is made by examining the character-
istics of projects in the baseline database and selecting the projects for which information
is deemed to be relevant. The effective determination of “similarity” is largely a matter of
experience.

Ideally, the cost estimation will be developed in the form of a cost for the system (and
each subsystem for which cost estimates are to be made) and an expected range in which
the costs are likely to be for the system whose cost is being estimated.

1.8.5 Reviews ancl Inspections

Different organizations have developed different approaches to ensure that software proj-
ects produce useful, correct software. Some techniques appear to work better in certain
development environments than others and, thus, there is difficulty in simply adapting one
successful approach to a totally different environment.

However, there is one thing that has been shown to be highly successful in every organi-
zation in which it is carried out properly: the design review. Reviews should be held at each
major milestone of a project, including requirements, design, source code, and test plans.
For a software life cycle that uses an iterative process, a review should be held at each itera-
tion of the creation of major items within the software life cycle.

‘The basic idea is simple: each artifact produced for a specific milestone during develop-
ment must be subjected to a formal review in which all relevant documents are provided;
a carefully designed set of questions must be answered; and the results of the review must
be written down and disseminated to all concerned parties.

The following will describe several kinds of reviews for requirements, design, source
code, and test plans. In the sense in which they are used here, the two terms review and
inspection are synonymous. In the general literature, the term inspection may be used in
this sense or may instead refer to a procedure for reading the relevant documents.

There is one other point that should be made about reviews and inspections. This book
emphasizes systematic methods that attempt to determine problems in requirements and
design well before the software is reduced to code. This emphasis is consistent with experi-
ences across a Wide variety of software projects in nearly every application area.

‘The open source approach of the development of the Linux operating system avoids
reviews of requirements and designs, and instead relies on the efforts of a large number
of programmers who review source code posted on line. Thus each source code module
is intensively reviewed, often by hundreds of programmers. Modifications to the source

code are controlled by a much smaller team of experts. Of course, there is also configura-
tion management and testing, just in different order. Consult the article by McConnell
(McConnell, 1999) for an overview of the open source approach.

90 @ Introduction to Software Engineering

this stage of their academic careers, and hence such familiarity will not be assumed in the
discussion in this book.

Two topics are often missing from the typical education of computer science students
(prior to taking a course emphasizing software engineering principles): detailed, practical
instruction in (1) requirements and (2) design.

Unfortunately, most of the other software engineering activities are irrelevant if the
requirements are wrong, incomplete, or vague. One way in which the term “wrong” here
is used is the sense of being inconsistent; one requirement contradicts another. Let us con-
sider what can happen in each of these three cases.

If the requirements for a project are wrong, then the rest of the software engineering
activities will have to be redone, assuming that someone recognizes the error or errors in the
requirements. This is extremely expensive, and often means that much of the subsequent work
is wrong and has to be discarded. In the worst case, all the project effort must be scrapped.

What else can “wrong” mean? It may mean that the requirements do not fit the desired
system’s initial use. This is called “building the system wrong.” “Wrong” might also mean
that the requirements are for a system that is obsolete or completely the opposite of what
most customers want. This is called “building the wrong system.”

‘There are two possibilities if the requirements are incomplete. The best-case scenario
when the requirements are incomplete is that the requirements are so modular that the
project’s design and code also can be developed in a modular manner. In this case, it is
possible that the missing requirement can be fulfilled by additions both to the design and
the source code implementation with relatively few changes needed to incorporate the new
requirements. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of iterative approaches such as
the rapid prototyping or spiral development life cycle models. ‘The flexibility is even greater
in projects using agile methods.

If the requirements were complete but not modular, then it is unlikely that the design
and the resulting source code will be modular. In this case, major portions of the design
and source code will have to be scrapped because they are difficult to create given the lack
of consistency with modern programming techniques and the software engineering goal
of modularity. The experience of many failed software projects strongly indicates that the
lack of modular requirements is very expensive.

The third category of poor requirements occurs when the requirements are vague. In
this situation, it is difficult to know if the design is correct, because the software designers
do not know precisely what requirements mean. The designers may make some unwar-
ranted assumptions about the intentions of the requirements engineer. These assumptions,
if not correct, can be the major source of disaster for projects. The most common problem
is that the unwarranted assumptions become part of the culture of the project and there-
fore are never questioned.

‘There is one more thing to keep in mind about vague requirements. If the requirements
are vague as stated, but the software engineers working on the project are highly knowl-
edgeable in a particular application domain and have the unquestioned capability to fill in
the gaps and complete them in a clear, unambiguous manner, an agile software develop-
ment process may work, provided there is support from senior management.

FIGURE 6.4 Illustration of the first step in the bottom-up approach to software integration: deter-
mination of bottom-level modules and linking each of them to an artificial driver module.

6.9 SOFTWARE INTEGRATION

Suppose that we have tested each of the software modules individually for a program writ-
ten in a procedural language such as C or Ada. Alternatively, suppose that we have tested
each of the classes that are to be used in an object-oriented program written in C++, Java,
Swift, or similar. The same issue occurs if the program contains multiple classes. We have
to have some assurance that the entire program works correctly as a unit.

In addition, we have to make sure that our program functions correctly as a system.
‘That is, we have to make certain that our program works properly with any software pack-
age that we intend to use with our program. Recall that this property, which is known as
interoperability, was one of the goals of software engineering discussed in Chapter 1.

‘The process of ensuring that programs that are created from individual program mod-
ules that work together as a unit is called software integration.

Of course, many software systems, including the one we are developing as part of our
major software engineering example, consist of both object-oriented and procedural por-
tions. Hence, it may be necessary to employ both procedurally and object-based software
integration techniques. The beginning software engineer may be surprised at the formality FIGURE 6.5 Illustration of the second step in the bottom-up approach to software integration:

tion is much more than simply getting the individual modules to compile and link together

into a complete system. The final software system must meet the requirements that were set

for it initially. This testing of the final software is called system testing to distinguish it from

the topic of unit testing, which is what was discussed in Sections 6.1 through 6.8.
Software integration is not always a smooth process, particularly in modern develop-

ment environments in which efficiency requires reuse of existing software modules or even

existing COTS packages. A major problem can occur if one or more modules are extremely
difficult to integrate with others. If the project’s management has determined that the rea-
son is the lack of adherence to standards or the low quality of the module in the sense of a
large number of software defects, then the original coding team, design team, or require-
ments team may be called on to help with the problem.

‘There are three common approaches to software integration:

 
 
  

+ Big bang
+ Bottom-up

+ Top-down

Each of these approaches has considerable advantages and disadvantages and, therefore,
each has its proponents and detractors. We describe each of these approaches in turn.

The big bang approach to software integration is so named because it attempts to inte-
grate the previously tested software modules and existing COTS products into a complete
system without any preliminary software integration activities. The basic idea is to see if the
system works as an entirety without any changes to individual modules or configuration.

   

Ideally, the newly created system will work perfectly. The big bang approach is illustrated FIGURE 6.7 Illustration of the final step in the bottom-up approach to software integration: inte-
in Figure 6.3. In the figure the boxes represent individual software modules, subsystems, gration of the top-level module into the system with all artificial driver modules replaced by actual
modules.

‘The bottom-up approach is best suited to reuse of software components that are fairly
fine grained in the sense that they have a clearly defined, but narrowly limited, function-
ality. The likelihood of having a large number of such functions to characterize, catalog,
maintain, and access is small if there is not a large reuse library of such components.

‘The top-down approach is best suited to a situation in which there are a few, higher-level
components. This can avoid the overhead of maintenance of a reuse library. Reusing large,
high-level components has the potential to reduce system costs. However, finding an exact
match of an existing high-level software component to an actual set of requirements is
relatively rare.

We now turn to a discussion of integration issues for object-oriented programs. It is
clear that complete testing of all possible interactions of objects is essentially impossible.

‘The source code we used for some simple arithmetic with complex numbers that was
given in Example 6.5 illustrates this effective impossibility. Consider the possibilities: each
complex, real, double, or integer operand must be paired with a second operand of the
same set of types. This is a minimum of sixteen possible cases, each of which must be tested
to have even one example of each type tested. There are sixty-four cases if we allow multiple
types of the results of the arithmetic operations, with one test case for each pair of possible
argument types and four basic arithmetic operations. This is entirely too much.

Of course, integration issues are even more complex for software that has both pro-
cedural and object-oriented portions. We advocate striving for even a higher degree of
modularity than norma] in this situation. Considering the portions separately as much as
possible seems to be the best approach, but there is little research to guide the practitioner.

In some circumstances, another integration technique, known as plug and play, may
be used. It is easiest to explain the technique by an example. Some software systems, such
as those used for aircraft control, can never be taken off-line. For such systems, new mod-
ules that add functionality or modules that are replacements for faulty ones must be inte-
grated during regular operation. This requires a very careful integration process that we

testing the “glueware” used to combine these utilities. It is clear that black-box testing is a
natural choice for most of our system.

What about white-box testing? This method appears to be especially appropriate when
there are many execution paths and complex internal logic. This seems to characterize the
software intended to provide an interface to the operating system for the linking of the
names of input files to later routines in the program. Recall that this was to be done by
means of command-line arguments. The requirement to allow wild cards in the input file
names and to treat multilevel directories properly suggests a complexity that makes check-
ing each path especially important.

Of course some object-oriented methods must be applied to the back end of the system.
It seems as if the main questions to be answered about this subsystem’s correctness are the
completeness of the member functions of the appropriate classes and the proper assign-
ment of default values to member functions.

‘This section will close with the following two changes to the requirements for the major
project. You willbe asked to modify the testing and integration processes in order to reflect
the new requirements in the exercises. ‘The first change is that the customer now wants a
web-based user interface instead of one that is PC based. What changes need to be made to
the testing and integration processes? The second change is that the customer now wants to
use a cloud for data storage instead of one that is PC based. What changes need to be made
to the testing and integration process?

6.18 INTEGRATING THE MAJOR SOFTWARE PROJECT

We will now apply the techniques of software integration to the large running software
example that we have been considering throughout this book. The assumption is that all
the modules have been tested individually and that all have passed their tests.

In order to avoid writing a large number of artificial drivers or stubs, we will follow
an integration approach that is a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up techniques. We will
start with a top-down approach. ‘The interface will be checked to see if the file names are
properly handled. Each input source code file will be checked to see if the first subsystem
recognizes the files and the appropriate directories. This is little removed from the testing
techniques that we would apply to this subsystem if we tested it by itself.

Once we have tested the initial subsystem properly and linked to the operating system
by means of command-line arguments, we will then begin linking the analysis subsystem
modules in groups. Naturally, we will consider each of the analysis tools as a single entity
for the purpose of software integration.

‘There is one point to be discussed before we begin. MS/DOS has a facility to connect the
output of one executable file to the input of another using pipes, in much the same way that
UNIX allows the pipe method of interprocess communication. Commands such as

 

type file.txt |more

allow multiple actions to take place with simple commands. It is conceivable that we could
link file analysis tools by using a command such as

Problems with incremental development

Although incremental development has many advantages, itis not problem free. The primary cause of the
difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and
there may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.

Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons. For example, there may be procedures to ensure
that the software meets properly implements extemal regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes
Oxley accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible, so process conflicts may
be unavoidable.

much has been implemented. Customers find it difficult to judge progress from
software design documents.

3. Early delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible,
even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to use
and gain value from the software earlier than is possible with a waterfall process.

From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:

1. The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure pro-
eress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost effective to produce docu-
ments that reflect every version of the system.

2. System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Regular change
leads to messy code as new functionality is added in whatever way is possible.
It becomes increasingly difficult and costly to add new features to a system. To
reduce structural degradation and general code messiness, agile methods sug-
gest that you should regularly refactor (improve and restructure) the software.

The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large,
complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the
system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture, and the responsi-
bilities of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly
defined with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather
than developed incrementally.

Incremental development does not mean that you have to deliver each increment
to the system customer. You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to
customers and other stakeholders for comment, without necessarily delivering it
and deploying it in the customer's environment. Incremental delivery (covered in
Section 2.3.2) means that the software is used in real, operational processes, so user
feedback is likely to be realistic. However, providing feedback is not always possi-
ble as experimenting with new software can disrupt normal business processes.

activities apart from programming and testing. Itis perfectly feasible, in a plan-driven
process, to allocate requirements and plan the design and development phase as a
series of increments. An agile process is not inevitably code-focused, and it may
produce some design documentation. Agile developers may decide that an iteration
should not produce new code but rather should produce system models and documentation.

Agile methods

In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a widespread view that the best way to
achieve better software was through careful project planning, formalized quality
assurance, use of analysis and design methods supported by software tools, and con-
trolled and rigorous software development processes. This view came from the soft-
ware engineering community that was responsible for developing large, long-lived
software systems such as aerospace and government systems.

This plan-driven approach was developed for software developed by large teams,
working for different companies. Teams were often geographically dispersed and
worked on the software for long periods of time. An example of this type of software
is the control systems for a modern aircraft, which might take up to 10 years from
initial specification to deployment. Plan-driven approaches involve a significant
overhead in planning, designing, and documenting the system. This overhead is jus-
tified when the work of multiple development teams has to be coordinated, when the
system is a critical system, and when many different people will be involved in
maintaining the software over its lifetime.

However, when this heavyweight, plan-driven development approach is applied
to small and medium-sized business systems, the overhead involved is so large that
it dominates the software development process. More time is spent on how the sys-
tem should be developed than on program development and testing. As the system
requirements change, rework is essential and, in principle at least, the specification
and design have to change with the program.

Dissatisfaction with these heavyweight approaches to software engineering
led to the development of agile methods in the late 1990s. These methods allowed
the development team to focus on the software itself rather than on its design and
documentation. They are best suited to application development where the sys-
tem requirements usually change rapidly during the development process. They
are intended to deliver working software quickly to customers, who can then pro-
pose new and changed requirements to be included in later iterations of the sys-
tem. They aim to cut down on process bureaucracy by avoiding work that has
dubious long-term value and eliminating documentation that will probably never
be used.

The philosophy behind agile methods is reflected in the agile manifesto (http://
agilemanifesto.org) issued by the leading developers of these methods. This mani-
festo states:

to be unsuitable or may not work properly with other chosen components. You
may have to find alternatives to these components. Further requirements changes
may therefore be necessary, depending on the functionality of these components.

4. Development is a composition process where the discovered components are
integrated. This involves integrating the components with the component model
infrastructure and, often, developing adaptors that reconcile the interfaces of
incompatible components. Of course, additional functionality may also be
required over and above that provided by reused components.

The architectural design stage is particularly important. Jacobsen et al. (Jacobsen,
Gniss, and Jonsson 1997) found that defining a robust architecture is critical for suc-
cessful reuse. During the architectural design activity, you may choose a component
model and implementation platform. However, many companies have a standard
development platform (e.g.,.NET), so the component model is predetermined. As |
discussed in Chapter 6, you also establish the high-level architecture of the system at
this stage and make decisions about system distribution and control.

An activity that is unique to the CBSE process is identifying candidate compo-
nents or services for reuse. This involves a number of subactivities, as shown in
Figure 16.8. Initially, your focus should be on search and selection. You need to
convince yourself that components are available to meet your requirements.
Obviously, you should do some initial checking that the component is suitable, but
detailed testing may not be required. In the later stage, after the system architecture
has been designed, you should spend more time on component validation. You need
to be confident that the identified components are really suited to your application; if
not, then you have to repeat the search and selection processes.

The first step in identifying components is to look for components that are available
within your company or from trusted suppliers. There are few component vendors, so
you are most likely to be looking for components that have been developed in your own
organization or in the repositories of open-source software that are available. Software
development companies can build their own database of reusable components without
the risks inherent in using components from extemal suppliers. Alternatively, you may
decide to search code libraries available on the web, such as Sourceforge, GitHub, or
Google Code, to see if source code for the component that you need is available.

Once the component search process has identified possible components, you have to
select candidate components for assessment. In some cases, this will be a straightforward
task. Components on the list will directly implement the user requirements, and there will
not be competing components that match these requirements. In other cases, however,
the selection process is more complex. There will not be a clear mapping of requirements
onto components. You may find that several components have to be integrated to meet a

important that these interfaces are not too restrictive so that the system elements
can evolve and continue to be useful participants in the SoS.

4. Provide collaboration incentives. When the system elements are independently
owned and managed, it is important each system owner have incentives to continue
to participate in the system. These may be financial incentives (pay per use or reduced
Operational costs), access incentives (you share your data and I'll share mine), or
community incentives (participate in a SoS and you get a say in the community).

Sillitto (Sillitto 2010) has added to these principles and suggests additional
important design guidelines. These include the following:

1. Design a SoS as node and web architecture. Nodes are sociotechnical systems
that include data, software, hardware, infrastructure (technical components),
and organizational policies, people, processes, and training (sociotechnical).
The web is not just the communications infrastructure between nodes, but it also
provides a mechanism for informal and formal social communications between
the people managing and running the systems at each node.

2. Specify behavior as services exchanged between nodes. The development of
service-oriented architectures now provides a standard mechanism for system
operability. [fa system does not already provide a service interface, then this
interface should be implemented as part of the SoS development process.

3. Understand and manage system vulnerabilities. In any SoS, there will be unex-
pected failures and undesirable behavior. It is critically important to try to
understand vulnerabilities and design the system to be resilient to such failures.

The key message that emerges from both Maier’s and Sillitto’s work is that 50S
architects have to take a broad perspective. They need to look at the system as a
whole, taking into account both technical and sociotechnical considerations.
Sometimes the best solution to a problem is not more software but changes to the
rules and policies that govern the operation of the system.

Architectural frameworks such as MODAF (MOD 2008) and TOGAF (TOGAF
is a registered trademark of The Open Group 2011) have been suggested as a means
of supporting the architectural design of systems of systems. Architectural frame-
works were originally developed to support enterprise systems architectures, which
are portfolios of separate systems. Enterprise systems may be organizational systems
of systems, or they may have a simpler management structure so that the system
portfolio can be managed as a whole. Architectural frameworks are intended for the
development of organizational systems of systems where there is a single govern-
ance authority for the entire SoS.

An architectural framework recognizes that a single model of an architecture does
not present all of the information needed for architectural and business analysis.
Rather, frameworks propose a number of architectural views that should be created
and maintained to describe and document enterprise systems. Frameworks have
much in common and tend to reflect the language and history of the organizations

THE GOALS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN 351

only the code. The benefits of a fully detailed design are balanced against the time required to document and
maintain detailed designs. For large efforts, levels in between high level and detailed design may be identified.

This chapter introduces the concepts, needs, and terminology of software design. It sets the stage for
the remaining chapters in this part of the book, which include various concrete examples.

15.1 THE GOALS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN

The first goal of a software design is to be sufficient for satisfying the requirements. Usually, software designs must
also anticipate changes in the requirements, and so a second goal is flexibility. Another goal of software design is
robustness: the ability of the product to anticipate a broad variety of input. These and other goals are summarized in
Figure 15.2.

These goals sometimes oppose one another. For example, to make a design efficient it may be necessary
to combine modules in ways that limit flexibility. In fact, we trade off goals against each other in ways that
depend on the project's priorities.

A software design is sufficient if it provides the components for an implementation that satisties the
requirements. To assess such sufficiency, one needs to be able to understand it. This fact is obvious, but it has
profound consequences. It can be difficult to create an understandable design for applications due to the large
number of options that are typically available. OpenOffice, for example, is a very complex application when
viewed in complete detail. Yet OpenOffice is simple when viewed at a high level, as consisting of a few
subapplications: word processing, spreadsheet, presentations, and database.

Modularity is thus a key to understandability. Software is modular when it is divided into separately named
and addressable components. Modular software is much easier to understand than monolithic software, and
parts can be replaced without affecting other parts. It is easier to plan, develop, modify, document, and test.
When software is modular you can more easily assign different people to work on different parts.

A design isa form of communication. In its most elementary form, it documents the result of a designer's
thought process, and is used to communicate back to himself thereafter when he needs to know what he
designed. This is fine if the designer is to be the only person who has this need, but a project usually involves
several people throughout its lifetime. If a design is not understandable for them, it is of limited value, and the
project's health is at risk. Design simplification, in particular, frequently results in a better design.
Understandability is usually achieved by organizing the design as a progression from a high level with a
manageable number of parts, then increasing the detail on the parts.

A good software architect and designer forms a clear mental model of how the application will work at
an overall level, then develops a decomposition to match this mental model. She first asks the key modularity

 

* Sufficiency: handles the requirements

* Understandability: can be understood by intended audience

* Modularity: divided into well-defined parts

* Cohesion: organized so like-minded elements are grouped together

* Coupling: organized to minimize dependence between elements

* Robustness: can deal with wide variety of input

* Flexibility: can be readily modified to handle changes in requirements
* Reusability: can use parts of the design and implementation in other applications
* Information hiding: module internals are hidden from others

* Efficiency: executes within acceptable time and space limits

* Reliability: executes with acceptable failure rate

Figure 15.3 High cohesion and low coupling—bridge example

question such as: What five or six modules should we use to decompose a personal finance application? What
four or five modules neatly encompass a word processing application? After deciding this, she turns to
decomposing the components, and so on. This process is sometimes called “recursive design" because it
repeats the design process on design components at successively fine scales. Software decomposition itself
involves consideration of cohesion and coupling.

Cohesion within a module is the degree to which the module's elements belong together. In other
words, itis a measure of how focused a module is. The idea is not just to divide software into arbitrary parts
(ie., modularity), but to keep related issues in the same part. Coupling describes the degree to which modules
communicate with other modules. The higher the degree of coupling, the harder it is to understand and
change the system. To modularize effectively, we maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This principle helps to
decompose complex tasks into simpler ones.

Software engineering uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a principal means of explaining
design. Understand ing software design concepts by means of analogous physical artifacts is helpful to some,
and we will employ this means on occasion. Figure 15.3, for example, suggests coupling/cohesion goals by
showing an architecture for a bridge, in which each of the six components has a great deal of cohesion and
where the coupling between them is low. The parts of each bridge component belong together (e.g., the
concrete and the embedded metal reinforcing it this is high cohesion. On the other hand, each component
depends on just a few other components—two or three, in fact. This is low coupling.

The ‘Steel truss” in Figure 15.4, on the other hand, shows many components depending on each other at
one place. We would question this high degree of coupling.

616 CHAPTER24 REFACTORING

24.6 INTRODUCING MODULES

Good design requires modularization: a process of separating its essential elements. Whenever feasible, this
should be performed in advance. However, it is very useful to modularize after the fact as well—in other
words, to recognize useful modularization as the application grows and transitions into maintenance.

Classes by themselves are a means of modularization, but an application can contain hundreds of classes,
and so classes need organizing to enable designers to manage and apply them. A useful way to handle
modularity on this scale is via the Facade design pattern. Simplifying matters, the problem can be reduced to
thatshown in Figure 24.21, in which the design involves classes U, V, and W, where U references (mentions)
classes V and W. An example is U=Transaction, V=Customer, and W=Loan pool. Suppose that we want to
avoid multiple references like this (think of many classes instead of just the two in this simplification, and you
can imagine the resulting complexity). Class LJ must be modified because it should no longer reference both
classes V and W.

The refactoring in Figure 24.21 is simpleif U does not need to instantiate V objects or W objects. Thisis
the case when U needs only static methods of V or W. (Example: A transaction needs only a generic customer
functionality such as getting average assets of all customers; and the total amount in the loan pool.) In that
case, U references functionality in F only, and F does the work of translating such function calls into the static
calls on V or W.

The situation may be more involved, however. Suppose that U requires V instances in order to operate
(such as is usually the case when a transaction involves a customer). Ifwe want to protect V within a package,
then U has to depend on the facade interface F and no longer on V directly. Figure 24.22 shows how this can
be dealt with. First, Vis provided with an abstract interface VI (Step 1) that abstracts its public methods.
The Extract Interface refactoring can be used for this. Next, in Step 2, V is enclosed in a module (or package)

Figure 27.12 Module self-dependency—consider its effect on integration

handles the collection of data from patients, one that analyzes data for specific diseases, one that handles
emergency notifications such as calls to the police, and so on. It makes a great deal of sense to develop these
modules separately. For example, why not develop the diabetic analysis in an organization specializing in that
field, and have emergency notification developed by a company with experience in writing such software
reliably? Some modules may be effectively written by skilled teams working anywhere, geographically
speaking. Although continual integration, described below, is preferable in general, it may not be practical in
a case like this. Each high-level module and its subsidiaries may have to be developed separately, and then
integrated in big bang fashion.

The integration and testing of modules illustrates the wisdom of designing so that dependencies are
noncyclic. In other words, we try to avoid architectures in which a module depends on itself. Figure 27.12
illustrates such an architecture. We can't fully test any pair of modules alone. Our only choice is to use stubs or
to test all of them together, which multiplies the potential for hard-to-find and hard-to-fix defects.

27.3.2 Incremental Integration

Nowadays, software integration typically proceeds in an incremental manner in which software modules are
developed and assembled into progressively larger parts of the system. This is known as incremental integration
[1]. Gradually building the system means complexity increases incrementally, making it easier to isolate
integration problems. Incremental integration commences when the first two parts of an application are
developed, and continues until all its parts have been integrated into acomplete system, at which time system
testing commences. Stubs and drivers are employed during this process.

Throughout the integration process, software “builds” may be created that form the emerging system, as
illustrated in Figure 27.13. Before adding new modules, integration tests are executed against each build,
ensuring that the build works correctly. Figure 27.2 implies that modules are developed and integrated in
some order, but does not suggest how the order is determined. We usually determine the integration order by
basing it on the design of the system. Two common methods are bottom-up and top-down, and each must
account for dependencies between the modules making up the design.

27.3.3 Bottom-Up Integration

Suppose that an application consists of the modules and dependencies as shown in Figure 27.14.

In bottom-up integration, modules that are most depended on are developed and integrated first. Then
the modules that de pend on them are integrated next, and soon. In Figure 27.14, this implies thatModule 3 is
developed first, since it is at the “bottom" of the dependency tree. Modules 1 and 2 are integrated next with

the code that was checked in during the previous day. This makes the job of problem isolation and resolution
easier than if a longer time interval had elapsed between builds.

27.5 INTERFACE TESTING

Interface tests validate the interface of each module from the viewpoint of their usage by a client. These can be
conducted, to the extent possible, prior to the integration of a module (with necessary stubs), and then after
the integration of the module (with, typically, a reduced set of stubs). The Facade design pattern can be used
to facilitate interface testing. A facade object is created for each class or package, providing an implementa-
tion of its public interface. Each method in the facade checks its input parameters to ensure they are passed
correctly and returns a predetermined response. Thus, the caller can test its interface with a module without
knowledge of whether it is using the facade or the real implementation. This makes problem discovery and
isolation easier. Let's return to the video store as an example. Figure 27.24 shows the module decomposition
for this application.

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an
idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So i am breaking them down,
each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the

Good morning Claire.

Unfortunately , i got news that my uncle passed away in the early hours of this day despite all the best
efforts of the hospital staffTo be frank, i knew deep inside that only a miracle could reverse the
inevitable because the odds were most upsetting from the beginning.

So i would like to please take today off in order to start dealing with all the consequences brought
forward by the event and i have just sent through the timetastic app a request for the day; | will also
need to go pick up at the airport some family members who will be leaving Paris this very morning.

So therefore from now on, our sftp users will not have to do anything really..
All they will have to care about is ... choosing a username....and the rest is done for them.
Best yet the process can be repeated for an unlimited number of users.

On the test performed on a server with one core and 2 GB of ram, the server was able to generate the
keys and set up all aspects of the server at the rate of 5 users per second.

| will push the updated code tomorrow

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday... was running

| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144.217.84.102

-username: arnold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

lam also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Good morning Claire.With the unavaibility of the arnoldclarkemployee site, | thought | would remind
you that | was meant to be have a day off today.
Claire Thomson 30/12/22 08:53

Yes that's fine take your day off there's very little you can do anyway

Did you manage to get any servers scanned yesterday? Didn't get a chance for catch up

30/12/22 09:44

Actually before my message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before running it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

Claire Thomson 30/12/22 09:45 Edited

yeah it'd be much easier to build a large manifest and do them all at the same time, would let us add

So here is my question:

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance
you would be interested into an investigation about an alternative which is about combining Nexus
(Artifact repository) and SonarQube (code vulnerability scanner that is applicable to Docker)

Of course both Sonarqube and Nexus are Open source but used by banks...the banks i was supported
not so long ago were using it.

re Thomson 20/12/22 15:29

No we've just renewed our contract with Palo Alto, we can use it for scanning on prem stuff too - there's

lots of bits we don't use
it scans our repository too

20/12/22 15:30

aaaah it is too late@®

Claire Thomson 20/12/22 15:30

it can do code scanning and stuff and is in the pipelines

Good morning Claire.

| hope my message finds you well.

So, i was fortunate enough to review some of the awaiting tickets we have with Greg a couple of days
ago and i noticed a couple of them that are dealing with some security issues with a sftp server used

by one of our partners.

So i was wondering if i could may be take a few minutes of your time either today or tomorrow to
review these tickets together and see if i can begin dealing with them.

Of course i am fully aware that i haven't yet managed to deal with all the issues around knowing the
company environment but i think this very serious exercise could help me get to know the environment

even faster.

Also as i believe i should be able to bank a little bit on my recent role in cybersecurity to may be offer
some efficient solutions.

Please let me know what you think about this plan and many thanks in advance.

Thank you for your help on this.

absolutely no problem!

09/12/22 11:29
Hi Claire i would have a quick question.
So as we use Azure internally for our devops pipelines, i wanted to take a quick online course about
the ways of Azure. So | already bought a course on Udemy for this and wanted to know if you would be
ok with me going through this for about a week or so. | already went through the links you sent me and

can already see a lot of similarities with AWS and GCP but i thought such a course can only make things
even easier in the short to long term.

Of course, this course will not take any precedence whatsoever on any other important activities we
might have at any time of the day.

Thank you in advance

And one last question.

i noticed the icinga alerts by email. Are we the team supposed to write some scripts to
minimize/resolve some of these issues ? | would say yes since we are in the loop but i wanted to make
sure of this.

| noticed quite a few alerts around memory issues.Are we making use of packages such as zram for
memory optimization at all ? | am asking because i know from experience that with zram deployed,
memory utilization becomes way more efficient and we will see the very same servers doing the same
job with on average less memory used.

Thank you. The course was not at all expensive as is often the case on udemy

Claire Thomson 09/12/22 12:00

The alerts can be noisy, we're tried optimising the alerts previously but they're never quite right and
we've warnings set up too. We'll be moving alerts over to icinga2 and with the migration from Centos to
Ubuntu we're not overly concerned with the memory alerts at the moment - there's also lots of
resources available should we need to add any. We're not using zram. Those alerts do fluctuate quite a
bit by email

Most of the issues tend to be with the apps not being optimised, the alerts we care about most are the
ones we have set up for SMS - the critical ones that would require something to be done immediately

yes indeed 10 is a bit too low too...there already about 5 people in our team...and that would mean
that a message could not be forwarded to more than 4 extra persons...may be they could settle for
something around may be between 30 and 50.Honestly all these subjects are most definitively

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance

Did you manage to get any servers scanned yesterday? Didn't get a chance for catch up

30/12/22 09:44

Actually befo y message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before rfirMing it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

Claire Thomson 30/12/22 09:45 Edited

yeah it'd be much easier to build a large manifest and do them all at the same time, would let us add

keys to everything too
that's not a problem - enjoy your day off - sorry it's been such a chaotic start to your AC journey!

Hello Claire.

| have a quicl question
Edited
so regarding the sftp ticket...i am adding the possibility of having an SSL encrypted communication

between the server and the client

Now i wanted to know if it is ok , in regards to the company policy to have some self signed certificate
as they present the advantage of being as tough as we can envision them (4096 bits encryption)

6 Janu

Hi Claire.
| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144)/17.84.102

-username: @nold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

| am also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Marcel

fact that the current user has not been used in more than 2 years

Hi Claire Thank you so much for asking.Unfortunately the situation has not improved and he is still
unconscious as we speak.It is a difficult situation but he is in very good hands soi keep hoping for
some improvement.

Claire Thomson 02/02 16:07

may be improvement soon

A key pair, cons
a private key, is a set of security
credentials that you use to prove your
identity when connecting to an Amazon

ng of a public key and

EC2 instance. Amazon EC2 stores the
public key on your instance, and you
store the private key. For Li
the private key allows you to securely

So as you can see,Amazon does generate 2 keys, one private and one public.
The public key is kept on the server

And the private key is sent to us for authentication so we get to keep the private key.

| will push the updated code tomorrow

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday....| was running
the risk of forgetting tomorrow (the ailment of old age as | come to experience it) and | wanted to
devote tomorrow to a more agile and elastic way of dynamically generate terraform steps for AWS.

Many thanks

Claire Thomson 05/02 12:01

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the
same.

To be honest trying to get users to provide an SSH key at all is often difficult @

Thanks for the message, enjoy the rest of your weekend. Hope your Uncle is still stable x

Please find above a copy of the ansible for deploying sftp servers on premises
There are just 2 little things left really:

-Fixing the odd behaviours i see when execution reaches line 144 (Ansible generation of TLS
Certificate..w||rks perfectly with bash but is misbehaving completely with Ansible)

-and obviously making use of loops once the issue with the TLS Certificate (a rather trivial task once all
is operational)

However would you be ok with a creative one liner bash script added to the package ?
Something like below to eventually circumvent the issue with the TLS generation:
#!/bin/bash

#running TLS CErtificate generation

openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out

/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -days 3650

Hello Claire.

So it is just to let you know that i went through the repository as you advised yesterday and i think i
see what you mean.

Yes the ansible i tried to push yesterday is a massive 400 lines one...that does the job and even set up
new features but does need to be broken in smaller chunks/roles .

So this is my plan if you dont mind:
-Have a session with Jason as expressed yesterday.| am just waiting for his availability for today
-Agree with him on the steps to migrate the centos sftp to ubuntu so that we are all on the same page

-And apply the same principles as above to my aws terraform ; in this regard, i already spoke to Zoe
and i think a little code reorganization wont hurt anyone. | ll try to emulate what we have under /ac-

Thanks! Cyber basically get to control what is used/not used, so unfortunately we don't get much say in
it - only when they decide something we have to implement whatever idea they've come up with good
or bad haha

I'll happily pass on your offej/should they want to take you up on it - it would be good for them to have
someone with technical imptémentation knowledge of security tools
10/05 11:00
® yes i know we just got to execute the overall plan they design..i was mentioning this just in case

they were to some days ask for the opinion of our department some days.

But if you get a chance to get them to listen, please mention to them that the easiest way to disrupt

attacks at the earliest stage is to use the package "psad" in conjonction with iptables
to disrupt attacks at the ealiest stage

Claire Thomson 10/05 11:02

yeah we have a company called Barrier that deal with intrusion detection

that's how we found out about the incident, but we've (company) a large windows estate to think of

too ®

so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS" under "aws", there will be a folder "vpc terraform version 1.3.7"

with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version 1.3.7.

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:33

why? this should all be in on
It should be along these line:
AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
o> vpe-1.tf

-- vpe-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

older, it's all still in separate folders?
iscussed

it should be "= 1.3.7"

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:44

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right &

push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that just
say "Typo" &

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an
idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them down,
each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

The reason why i initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are considered
isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for scalability and
strict isolation from each other.

Claire Thomson 23/05 15:28

yeah I'm guessing you'll have no outputs or variables, so you'll only need the main.tf and the file with
the VPC and all it's settings

it'll be much tider and easier to understand

once that's done and everything is imported and there's no changes in the plans, it will be easier to
make a module and pass in the values

yes this is why i am breaking it down for each of them and theen use the broken down files to bukld a

Good morning Claire.| would need your help on a few little things please.

So | learnt last week that i inherited from my uncle total estate and the news came as
a shock since i did not want that and told him so many times.

But it seems to me my uncle had some surprises for me in store even when not around.

So i inherited from his flat in Paris and his mansion in Abidjan-Cocody .

f i could be authorised to work remotely from outside of the UK for a couple of weeks in

Can you also remember in addition to pushing changes to git - you also need to pull changes from
master into your branch to keep it up to date please

you will be OK as no one else is working in the area you are at moment - but if we don't do it elsewhere
we would get really bad merge conflicts to resolve.

Hi Claire.

I think i did nterpret this comment from you the last time we had a chat about the terraform for
the vpc:

= Claire Thomson 19/05 11
So why? this should all be in one folder, it's all

It should be along these lines as discussed
AWS

in separate folders?

(contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)

vpe-1.tf
= vpe-2.tf
- variables.tf
— output.tf

it should be "= 1.3.7"

This si why i was going that route

but what is finally asked is pretty straightforward

and will ha dana hu tamarrauws i think i am aleasdw an it

i checked the result and it appears that the S3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical
iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since $3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.

Zoe MacKay 13/04 15:3

@ ah ok

Hey Zoe i am checking from the UI manually to see if the outcome from the $3 query is consistent with
the reality.| ll report back to you as soon as it is confirmed//or not

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR
iam watching your latest commit and noticed that part of the change:

SecretsFilter: 'ac1-sc-arch-ops-a-tasks-pat-token,new-relic-api-key'

23/02 14:15

replaced by

Good morning Zoe. | would have a quick question if you don't mind.So i heard during the meeting that
autoscaling was only now enabled in production.Was it specific to a product or is it the case across all
environments ? Also would you have by any chance something like a link to a place where the
applications we support/deal with are documented ?

Thank you in advance

Zoe MacKay 08/12/22 12:16

tm) Hi, we don't have it documented but it on our kubernetes clusters. You can find the config in the
terraform module we use here https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-tfmodule-aks-cluster and then
the specific cluster config https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform/tree/master/aks

Good morning Zoe...in all honesty, i am having a lot of problems to move safely towards the full
deployment on pp and might require a bit of your assistance for the deployment...and this is despite
having spent the whole evening plus an early start at 4 am today...i thought about jumping out the
window but then i thought it is kind of lame really...so for example i am still fighting with some
dependencies issues on kubectl for azure:

but then the github repository indicated does not have clear instructions for either windows or linux
So i am moving on the terraform part for now otherwise i wont have anything ready.

and it is the same for the admin credentials...

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR

e MacKay 23/02

We had automation users before christmas SC.Arch-Ops-A-Tasks@aco.arnoldclark.com) but

cause AD was locked down we had to move it to a cloud only account. This account has been re-
enabled so just moving everything back to using it. So the PAT token is just a different name in the key
vault that is being used in these specific pipelines

Hello Zoe....

i checked the result and it appears that the $3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical

iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since S3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.

About the Guide to the GDPR

The Guide to the UK GDPR is part of our Guide to Data Protection. It is for DPOs and others who have
day-to-day responsibility for data protection.

 

It explains the general data protection regime that applies to most UK businesses and organisations. It
covers the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), tailored by the Data Protection Act 2018.

It explains each of the data protection principles, rights and obligations. It summarises the key points you
need to know, answers frequently asked questions, and contains practical checklists to help you comply.

Where relevant, this guide also links to more detailed guidance and other resources, including ICO guidance
and statutory ICO codes of practice. Links to relevant guidance published by the European Data Protection
Board (EDPB) are also included for reference purposes.

You may also find other sections of the Guide to Data Protection useful:

e@ Introduction to data protection — for more on how the DPA 2018 works
@ Guide to law enforcement processing — for more on the separate regime for law enforcement
@ Guide to intelligence services processing — for more on the separate regime for the intelligence services

e Key data protection themes - for specific guidance on key themes and topics, including children’s data

Key definitions

Who does the UK GDPR apply to?

e The UK GDPR applies to ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’.
e A controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
e A processor is responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.

e If you are a processor, the UK GDPR places specific legal obligations on you; for example, you are
required to maintain records of personal data and processing activities. You will have legal liability if you
are responsible for a breach.

@ However, if you are a controller, you are not relieved of your obligations where a processor is involved —
the UK GDPR places further obligations on you to ensure your contracts with processors comply with the
UK GDPR.

e@ The UK GDPR applies to processing carried out by organisations operating within the UK. It also applies
to organisations outside the UK that offer goods or services to individuals in the UK.

e@ The UK GDPR does not apply to certain activities including processing covered by the Law Enforcement
Directive, processing for national security purposes and processing carried out by individuals purely for
personal/household activities.

Controllers and processors

At a glance

e@ Understanding your role in relation to the personal data you are processing is crucial in ensuring
compliance with the UK GDPR and the fair treatment of individuals.

e Your obligations under the UK GDPR will vary depending on whether you are a controller, joint controller
or processor.

e The ICO has the power to take action against controllers and processors under the UK GDPR.
@ Individuals can bring claims for compensation and damages against both controllers and processors.

@ You should take the time to assess, and document, the status of each organisation you work with in
respect of all the personal data and processing activities you carry out.

@ Whether you are a controller or processor depends on a number of issues. The key question is - who
determines the purposes for which the data are processed and the means of processing?

® Organisations that determine the purposes and means of processing will be controllers regardless of how
they are described in any contract about processing services.

Checklists

The following checklists set out indicators as to whether you are a controller, a processor or a joint
controller. The more boxes you tick, the more likely you are to fall within the relevant category.

@ What are ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’?

@ How do you determine whether you are a controller or processor?
@ What does it mean if you are a controller?

@ What does it mean if you are a processor?

@ What does it mean if you are joint controllers?

@ In more detail

What are ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’?

Controllers are the main decision-makers — they exercise overall control over the purposes and means of
the processing of personal data.

If two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing of the same personal
data, they are joint controllers. However, they are not joint controllers if they are processing the same data
for different purposes.

Processors act on behalf of, and only on the instructions of, the relevant controller.

How do you determine whether you are a controller or processor?

You should be able to differentiate between controllers, joint controllers and processors so you understand
which UK GDPR obligations apply to which organisation.

To determine whether you are a controller or processor, you will need to consider your role and
responsibilities in relation to your data processing activities.

If you exercise overall control of the purpose and means of the processing of personal data - ie, you decide
what data to process and why - you are a controller.

If you don’t have any purpose of your own for processing the data and you only act on a client’s
instructions, you are likely to be a processor — even if you make some technical decisions about how you
process the data.

What does it mean if you are a controller?

Controllers shoulder the highest level of compliance responsibility - you must comply with, and
demonstrate compliance with, all the data protection principles as well as the other UK GDPR requirements.
You are also responsible for the compliance of your processor(s).

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and individuals may take action against a controller regarding
a breach of its obligations.

Controllers in the UK must pay the data protection fee, unless they are exempt.

What does it mean if you are a processor?

Processors do not have the same obligations as controllers under the UK GDPR and do not have to pay a
data protection fee. However, if you are a processor, you do have a number of direct obligations of your

452


--- New Page 14 ---
Page number: 14
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

own under the UK GDPR.

Both the ICO and individuals may take action against a processor regarding a breach of those obligations.

What does it mean if you are joint controllers?

Joint controllers must arrange between themselves who will take primary responsibility for complying with
UK GDPR obligations, and in particular transparency obligations and individuals’ rights. They should make
this information available to individuals.

However, all joint controllers remain responsible for compliance with the controller obligations under the
UK GDPR. Both the ICO and individuals may take action against any controller regarding a breach of those
obligations.

What is personal data?

At a glance

e@ Understanding whether you are processing personal data is critical to understanding whether the
UK GDPR applies to your activities.

e Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

@ What identifies an individual could be as simple as a name or a number or could include other identifiers
such as an IP address or a cookie identifier, or other factors.

e If it is possible to identify an individual directly from the information you are processing, then that
information may be personal data.

e@ If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether
the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing
together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify
that individual.

@ Even if an individual is identified or identifiable, directly or indirectly, from the data you are processing,
it is not personal data unless it ‘relates to’ the individual.

e@ When considering whether information ‘relates to’ an individual, you need to take into account a range
of factors, including the content of the information, the purpose or purposes for which you are
processing it and the likely impact or effect of that processing on the individual.

@ It is possible that the same information is personal data for one controller’s purposes but is not personal
data for the purposes of another controller.

@ Information which has had identifiers removed or replaced in order to pseudonymise the data is still
personal data for the purposes of UK GDPR.

@ Information which is truly anonymous is not covered by the UK GDPR.

e If information that seems to relate to a particular individual is inaccurate (ie it is factually incorrect or is
about a different individual), the information is still personal data, as it relates to that individual.

In brief

@ What is personal data?
@ What are identifiers and related factors?
® Can we identify an individual directly from the information we have?

information)?

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

e The UK GDPR applies to the processing of personal data that is:
@ wholly or partly by automated means; or
@ the processing other than by automated means of personal data which forms part of, or is intended
to form part of, a filing system.
@ Personal data only includes information relating to natural persons who:
®@ can be identified or who are identifiable, directly from the information in question; or
@ who can be indirectly identified from that information in combination with other information.
e Personal data may also include special categories of personal data or criminal conviction and offences

data. These are considered to be more sensitive and you may only process them in more limited
circumstances.

e Pseudonymised data can help reduce privacy risks by making it more difficult to identify individuals, but
it is still personal data.

© If personal data can be truly anonymised then the anonymised data is not subject to the UK GDPR. It is
important to understand what personal data is in order to understand if the data has been anonymised.

e@ Information about a deceased person does not constitute personal data and therefore is not subject to
the UK GDPR.

@ Information about companies or public authorities is not personal data.

@ However, information about individuals acting as sole traders, employees, partners and company
directors where they are individually identifiable and the information relates to them as an individual
may constitute personal data.

What are identifiers and related factors?

@ An individual is ‘identified’ or ‘identifiable’ if you can distinguish them from other individuals.

@ A name is perhaps the most common means of identifying someone. However whether any potential
identifier actually identifies an individual depends on the context.

© A combination of identifiers may be needed to identify an individual.
e@ The UK GDPR provides a non-exhaustive list of identifiers, including:
® name;
@ identification number;
@ location data; and

@ an online identifier.

@ ‘Online identifiers’ includes IP addresses and cookie identifiers which may be personal data.

@ Other factors can identify an individual.

Can we identify an individual directly from the information we have?

e If, by looking solely at the information you are processing you can distinguish an individual from other
individuals, that individual will be identified (or identifiable).

@ You don’t have to know someone’s name for them to be directly identifiable, a combination of other
identifiers may be sufficient to identify the individual.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ If an individual is directly identifiable from the information, this may constitute personal data.

Can we identify an individual indirectly from the information we have (together with other
available information)?

@ It is important to be aware that information you hold may indirectly identify an individual and therefore
could constitute personal data.

e@ Even if you may need additional information to be able to identify someone, they may still be
identifiable.

e That additional information may be information you already hold, or it may be information that you need
to obtain from another source.

e@ In some circumstances there may be a slight hypothetical possibility that someone might be able to
reconstruct the data in such a way that identifies the individual. However, this is not necessarily
sufficient to make the individual identifiable in terms of UK GDPR. You must consider all the factors at
stake.

@ When considering whether individuals can be identified, you may have to assess the means that could
be used by an interested and sufficiently determined person.

@ You have a continuing obligation to consider whether the likelihood of identification has changed over
time (for example as a result of technological developments).

What is the meaning of ‘relates to’?

e@ Information must ‘relate to’ the identifiable individual to be personal data.
@ This means that it does more than simply identifying them — it must concern the individual in some way.
e@ To decide whether or not data relates to an individual, you may need to consider:
@ the content of the data - is it directly about the individual or their activities?;
@ the purpose you will process the data for; and
e@ the results of or effects on the individual from processing the data.
e Data can reference an identifiable individual and not be personal data about that individual, as the
information does not relate to them.

e@ There will be circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether data is personal data. If this
is the case, as a matter of good practice, you should treat the information with care, ensure that you
have a clear reason for processing the data and, in particular, ensure you hold and dispose of it securely.

@ Inaccurate information may still be personal data if it relates to an identifiable individual.

What happens when different organisations process the same data for different purposes?

@ It is possible that although data does not relate to an identifiable individual for one controller, in the
hands of another controller it does.

@ This is particularly the case where, for the purposes of one controller, the identity of the individuals is
irrelevant and the data therefore does not relate to them.

@ However, when used for a different purpose, or in conjunction with additional information available to
another controller, the data does relate to the identifiable individual.

456


--- New Page 18 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the purpose for which the controller is using the data in
order to decide whether it relates to an individual.

@ You should take care when you make an analysis of this nature.

Principles

At a glance

e The UK GDPR sets out seven key principles:
e Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

e Accuracy
e Storage limitation
e@ Integrity and confidentiality (security)

@ Accountability

e These principles should lie at the heart of your approach to processing personal data.

In brief

@ What are the principles?

@ Why are the principles important?

What are the principles?

Article 5 of the UK GDPR sets out seven key principles which lie at the heart of the general data protection
regime.

Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be:

66

“(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (lawfulness,
fairness and transparency’);

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that
is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be
incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);

(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (‘data minimisation’);

(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);

458


--- New Page 20 ---
Page number: 20
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods
insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the
appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the
rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);

(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).”

Article 5(2) adds that:

“The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1
(accountability’).”

For more detail on each principle, please read the relevant page of this guide.

Why are the principles important?

The principles lie at the heart of the UK GDPR. They are set out right at the start of the legislation, and
inform everything that follows. They don’t give hard and fast rules, but rather embody the spirit of the
general data protection regime - and as such there are very limited exceptions.

Compliance with the spirit of these key principles is therefore a fundamental building block for good data
protection practice. It is also key to your compliance with the detailed provisions of the UK GDPR.

Failure to comply with the principles may leave you open to substantial fines. Article 83(5)(a) states that
infringements of the basic principles for processing personal data are subject to the highest tier of
administrative fines. This could mean a fine of up to £17.5 million, or 4% of your total worldwide annual
turnover, whichever is higher.

Accountability principle

The accountability principle requires you to take responsibility for what you do with personal data and how
you comply with the other principles.

You must have appropriate measures and records in place to be able to demonstrate your compliance.

Storage limitation

At a glance

@ You must not keep personal data for longer than you need it.

@ You need to think about - and be able to justify — how long you keep personal data. This will depend on
your purposes for holding the data.

e You need a policy setting standard retention periods wherever possible, to comply with documentation
requirements.

e You should also periodically review the data you hold, and erase or anonymise it when you no longer
need it.

e@ You must carefully consider any challenges to your retention of data. Individuals have a right to erasure
if you no longer need the data.

@ You can keep personal data for longer if you are only keeping it for public interest archiving, scientific or
historical research, or statistical purposes.

® Do we need a retention policy?

@ When should we review our retention?

@ What should we do with personal data that we no longer need?

@ How long can we keep personal data for archiving, research or statistical purposes?

@ How does this apply to data sharing?

What is the storage limitation principle?

Article 5(1)(e) says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods
insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject
to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation
in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’)”

So, even if you collect and use personal data fairly and lawfully, you cannot keep it for longer than you
actually need it.

There are close links here with the data minimisation and accuracy principles.

The UK GDPR does not set specific time limits for different types of data. This is up to you, and will depend
on how long you need the data for your specified purposes.

Why is storage limitation important?

Ensuring that you erase or anonymise personal data when you no longer need it will reduce the risk that it
becomes irrelevant, excessive, inaccurate or out of date. Apart from helping you to comply with the data
minimisation and accuracy principles, this also reduces the risk that you will use such data in error — to the
detriment of all concerned.

Personal data held for too long will, by definition, be unnecessary. You are unlikely to have a lawful basis for
retention.

From a more practical perspective, it is inefficient to hold more personal data than you need, and there

464


--- New Page 26 ---
Page number: 26
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

may be unnecessary costs associated with storage and security.

Remember that you must also respond to subject access requests for any personal data you hold. This may
be more difficult if you are holding old data for longer than you need.

Good practice around storage limitation - with clear policies on retention periods and erasure - is also likely
to reduce the burden of dealing with queries about retention and individual requests for erasure.

Do we need a retention policy?

Retention policies or retention schedules list the types of record or information you hold, what you use it
for, and how long you intend to keep it. They help you establish and document standard retention periods
for different categories of personal data.

A retention schedule may form part of a broader ‘information asset register’ (IAR), or your general
processing documentation.

To comply with documentation requirements, you need to establish and document standard retention
periods for different categories of information you hold wherever possible. It is also advisable to have a
system for ensuring that your organisation keeps to these retention periods in practice, and for reviewing
retention at appropriate intervals. Your policy must also be flexible enough to allow for early deletion if
appropriate. For example, if you are not actually using a record, you should reconsider whether you need to
retain it.

 

If you are a small organisation undertaking occasional low-risk processing, you may not need a
documented retention policy.

However, if you don’t have a retention policy (or if it doesn’t cover all of the personal data you hold), you
must still regularly review the data you hold, and delete or anonymise anything you no longer need.
Further reading — records management and retention schedules

The National Archives (TNA) @ publishes practical guidance for public authorities on a range of records
management topics, including retention and disposal. This guidance can help you comply with the
storage limitation principle (even if you are not a public authority):

 

FOI Records Management Code - Guide 8: Disposal of records @

 

The Keeper of the Records of Scotland @ also publishes guidance on Scottish public authorities’ records
management obligations, including specific guidance on retention schedules @.

 

 

How should we set retention periods?

The UK GDPR does not dictate how long you should keep personal data. It is up to you to justify this, based
on your purposes for processing. You are in the best position to judge how long you need it.

You must also be able to justify why you need to keep personal data in a form that permits identification of

465


--- New Page 27 ---
Page number: 27
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

individuals. If you do not need to identify individuals, you should anonymise the data so that identification
is no longer possible.

For example:

e You should consider your stated purposes for processing the personal data. You can keep it as long as
one of those purposes still applies, but you should not keep data indefinitely ‘just in case’, or if there is
only a small possibility that you will use it.

Example

A bank holds personal data about its customers. This includes details of each customer’s address, date
of birth and mother’s maiden name. The bank uses this information as part of its security procedures.
It is appropriate for the bank to retain this data for as long as the customer has an account with the
bank. Even after the account has been closed, the bank may need to continue holding some of this
information for legal or operational reasons for a further set time.

Example

A bank may need to retain images from a CCTV system installed to prevent fraud at an ATM machine
for several weeks, since a suspicious transaction may not come to light until the victim gets their bank
statement. In contrast, a pub may only need to retain images from their CCTV system for a short
period because incidents will come to light very quickly. However, if a crime is reported to the police,
the pub will need to retain images until the police have time to collect them.

Example

A tracing agency holds personal data about a debtor so that it can find that individual on behalf of a
creditor. Once it has found the individual and reported to the creditor, there may be no need to retain
the information about the debtor - the agency should remove it from their systems unless there are
good reasons for keeping it. For example, if the agency has also been asked to collect the debt on
behalf of the creditor.

@ You should consider whether you need to keep a record of a relationship with the individual once that
relationship ends. You may not need to delete all personal data when the relationship ends. You may
need to keep some information so that you can confirm that the relationship existed — and that it has
ended - as well as some of its details.

Example

A business may need to keep some personal data about a previous customer so that they can deal with
any complaints the customer might make about the services they provided.

Example

An employer should review the personal data it holds about an employee when they leave the
organisation’s employment. It will need to retain enough data to enable the organisation to deal with,
for example, providing references or pension arrangements. However, it should delete personal data
that it is unlikely to need again from its records — such as the employee’s emergency contact details,
previous addresses, or death-in-service beneficiary details.

Example

A business receives a notice from a former customer requiring it to stop processing the customer’s
personal data for direct marketing. It is appropriate for the business to retain enough information about
the former customer for it to stop including that person in future direct marketing activities.

@ You should consider whether you need to keep information to defend possible future legal claims.
However, you could still delete information that could not possibly be relevant to such a claim. Unless
there is some other reason for keeping it, personal data should be deleted when such a claim could no
longer arise.

Example

An employer receives several applications for a job vacancy. Unless there is a clear business reason for
doing so, the employer should not keep recruitment records for unsuccessful applicants beyond the
statutory period in which a claim arising from the recruitment process may be brought.

e You should consider any legal or regulatory requirements. There are various legal requirements and
professional guidelines about keeping certain kinds of records — such as information needed for income
tax and audit purposes, or information on aspects of health and safety. If you keep personal data to
comply with a requirement like this, you will not be considered to have kept the information for longer

467

than necessary.

@ You should consider any relevant industry standards or guidelines. For example, credit reference
agencies keep consumer credit data for six years. Industry guidelines are a good starting point for
standard retention periods and are likely to take a considered approach. However, they do not guarantee
compliance. You must still be able to explain why those periods are justified, and keep them under
review.

You must remember to take a proportionate approach, balancing your needs with the impact of retention
on individuals’ privacy. Don’t forget that your retention of the data must also always be fair and lawful.

When should we review our retention?

You should review whether you still need personal data at the end of any standard retention period, and
erase or anonymise it unless there is a clear justification for keeping it for longer. Automated systems can
flag records for review, or delete information after a pre-determined period. This is particularly useful if you
hold many records of the same type.

It is also good practice to review your retention of personal data at regular intervals before this, especially
if the standard retention period is lengthy or there is potential for a significant impact on individuals.

If you don’t have a set retention period for the personal data, you must regularly review whether you still
need it.

However, there is no firm rule about how regular these reviews must be. Your resources may be a relevant
factor here, along with the privacy risk to individuals. The important thing to remember is that you must be
able to justify your retention and how often you review it.

You must also review whether you still need personal data if the individual asks you to. Individuals have the
absolute right to erasure of personal data that you no longer need for your specified purposes.

What should we do with personal data that we no longer need?

You can either erase (delete) it, or anonymise it.

You need to remember that there is a significant difference between permanently deleting personal data,
and taking it offline. If personal data is stored offline, this should reduce its availability and the risk of
misuse or mistake. However, you are still processing personal data. You should only store it offline (rather
than delete it) if you can still justify holding it. You must be prepared to respond to subject access requests
for personal data stored offline, and you must still comply with all the other principles and rights.

The word ‘deletion’ can mean different things in relation to electronic data, and we recognise it is not
always possible to delete or erase all traces of the data. The key issue is to ensure you put the data beyond
use. If it is appropriate to delete personal data from a live system, you should also delete it from any
back-up of the information on that system.

Further reading

We produced detailed guidance on the issues surrounding deletion under the 1998 Act. This will be
updated for the UK GDPR in due course, but in the meantime still offers useful guidance on the

468


--- New Page 30 ---
Page number: 30
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

practical issues surrounding deletion:

Deleting personal data

 

Alternatively, you can anonymise the data so that it is no longer “in a form which permits identification of
data subjects”.

Personal data that has been pseudonymised — eg key-coded - will usually still permit identification.
Pseudonymisation can be a useful tool for compliance with other principles such as data minimisation and
security, but the storage limitation principle still applies.

How long can we keep personal data for archiving, research or statistical purposes?

You can keep personal data indefinitely if you are holding it only for:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;
e scientific or historical research purposes; or

e statistical purposes.

Although the general rule is that you cannot hold personal data indefinitely ‘just in case’ it might be useful
in future, there is an inbuilt exception if you are keeping it for these archiving, research or statistical
purposes.

You must have appropriate safeguards in place to protect individuals. For example, pseudonymisation may
be appropriate in some cases.

This must be your only purpose. If you justify indefinite retention on this basis, you cannot later use that
data for another purpose - in particular for any decisions affecting particular individuals. This does not
prevent other organisations from accessing public archives, but they must ensure their own collection and
use of the personal data complies with the principles.

How does this apply to data sharing?

If you share personal data with other organisations, you should agree between you what happens once you
no longer need to share the data. In some cases, it may be best to return the shared data to the
organisation that supplied it without keeping a copy. In other cases, all of the organisations involved should
delete their copies of the personal data.

Example

Personal data about the customers of Company A is shared with Company B, which is negotiating to
buy Company A’s business. The companies arrange for Company B to keep the information confidential,
and use it only in connection with the proposed transaction. The sale does not go ahead and Company
B returns the customer information to Company A without keeping a copy.

The organisations involved in an information-sharing initiative may each need to set their own retention
periods, because some may have good reasons to retain personal data for longer than others. However, if
you all only hold the data for the purposes of the data-sharing initiative and it is no longer needed for that
initiative, then all organisations with copies of the information should delete it.

@ What should we do if an individual challenges the accuracy of their personal data?

What is the accuracy principle?

Article 5(1)(d) of the UK GDPR says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are
erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’)”

This is the second of three principles about data standards, along with data minimisation and storage
limitation.

personal data corrected.
In practice, this means that you must:

@ take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of any personal data;
® ensure that the source and status of personal data is clear;
@ carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of information; and

® consider whether it is necessary to periodically update the information.

When is personal data ‘accurate’ or ‘inaccurate’?

The UK GDPR does not define the word ‘accurate’. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 does say that
‘inaccurate’ means “incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact”. It will usually be obvious whether
personal data is accurate.

You must always be clear about what you intend the record of the personal data to show. What you use it
for may affect whether it is accurate or not. For example, just because personal data has changed doesn’t
mean that a historical record is inaccurate - but you must be clear that it is a historical record.

472


--- New Page 34 ---
Page number: 34
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

If an individual moves house from London to Manchester a record saying that they currently live in
London will obviously be inaccurate. However a record saying that the individual once lived in London
remains accurate, even though they no longer live there.

Example

The Postcode Address File (PAF) contains UK property postal addresses. It is structured to reflect the
way the Royal Mail delivers post. So it is common for someone to have a postal address linked to a
town in one county (eg Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire) even if they actually live in another county (eg
Cheshire) and pay council tax to that council. The PAF file is not intended to accurately reflect county
boundaries.

What about records of mistakes?

There is often confusion about whether it is appropriate to keep records of things that happened which
should not have happened. Individuals understandably do not want their records to be tarnished by, for
example, a penalty or other charge that was later cancelled or refunded.

However, you may legitimately need your records to accurately reflect the order of events — in this
example, that a charge was imposed, but later cancelled or refunded. Keeping a record of the mistake and
its correction might also be in the individual’s best interests.

Example

A misdiagnosis of a medical condition continues to be held as part of a patient’s medical records even
after the diagnosis is corrected, because it is relevant for the purpose of explaining treatment given to
the patient, or for other health problems.

It is acceptable to keep records of mistakes, provided those records are not misleading about the facts. You
may need to add a note to make clear that a mistake was made.

Example

473


--- New Page 35 ---
Page number: 35
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

An individual finds that, because of an error, their account with their existing energy supplier has been
closed and an account opened with a new supplier. Understandably aggrieved, they believe the original
account should be reinstated and no record kept of the unauthorised transfer. Although this reaction is
understandable, if their existing supplier did close their account, and another supplier opened a new
account, then records reflecting what actually happened will be accurate. In such cases it makes sense
to ensure that the record clearly shows that an error occurred.

Example

An individual is dismissed for alleged misconduct. An Employment Tribunal finds that the dismissal was
unfair and the individual is reinstated. The individual demands that the employer deletes all references
to misconduct. However, the record of the dismissal is accurate. The Tribunal’s decision was that the
employee should not have been dismissed on those grounds. The employer should ensure its records
reflect this.

What about accuracy of opinions?

A record of an opinion is not necessarily inaccurate personal data just because the individual disagrees with
it, or it is later proved to be wrong. Opinions are, by their very nature, subjective and not intended to
record matters of fact.

However, in order to be accurate, your records must make clear that it is an opinion, and, where
appropriate, whose opinion it is. If it becomes clear that an opinion was based on inaccurate data, you
should also record this fact in order to ensure your records are not misleading.

Example

An area of particular sensitivity is medical opinion, where doctors routinely record their opinions about
possible diagnoses. It is often impossible to conclude with certainty, perhaps until time has passed or
tests have been done, whether a patient is suffering from a particular condition. An initial diagnosis
(which is an informed opinion) may prove to be incorrect after more extensive examination or further
tests. However, if the patient’s records reflect the doctor’s diagnosis at the time, the records are not
inaccurate, because they accurately reflect that doctor’s opinion at a particular time. Moreover, the
record of the doctor’s initial diagnosis may help those treating the patient later, and in data protection
terms is required in order to comply with the ‘adequacy’ element of the data minimisation principle.

If an individual challenges the accuracy of an opinion, it is good practice to add a note recording the
challenge and the reasons behind it.

How much weight is actually placed on an opinion is likely to depend on the experience and reliability of the

474


--- New Page 36 ---
Page number: 36
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

person whose opinion it is, and what they base their opinion on. An opinion formed during a brief meeting
will probably be given less weight than one derived from considerable dealings with the individual.
However, this is not really an issue of accuracy. Instead, you need to consider whether the personal data is
“adequate” for your purposes, in line with the data minimisation principle.

Note that some records that may appear to be opinions do not contain an opinion at all. For example, many
financial institutions use credit scores to help them decide whether to provide credit. A credit score is a
number that summarises the historical credit information on a credit report and provides a numerical
predictor of the risk involved in granting an individual credit. Credit scores are based on a statistical
analysis of individuals’ personal data, rather than on a subjective opinion about their creditworthiness.
However, you must ensure the accuracy (and adequacy) of the underlying data.

Does personal data always have to be up to date?

This depends on what you use the information for. If you use the information for a purpose that relies on it
remaining current, you should keep it up to date. For example, you should update your employee payroll
records when there is a pay rise. Similarly, you should update your records for customers’ changes of
address so that goods are delivered to the correct location.

In other cases, it will be equally obvious that you do not need to update information.

Example

An individual places a one-off order with an organisation. The organisation will probably have good
reason to retain a record of the order for a certain period for accounting reasons and because of
possible complaints. However, this does not mean that it has to regularly check that the customer is
still living at the same address.

You do not need to update personal data if this would defeat the purpose of the processing. For example, if
you hold personal data only for statistical, historical or other research reasons, updating the data might
defeat that purpose.

In some cases it is reasonable to rely on the individual to tell you when their personal data has changed,
such as when they change address or other contact details. It may be sensible to periodically ask
individuals to update their own details, but you do not need to take extreme measures to ensure your
records are up to date, unless there is a corresponding privacy risk which justifies this.

475


--- New Page 37 ---
Page number: 37
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

An organisation keeps addresses and contact details of previous customers for marketing purposes. It
does not have to use data matching or tracing services to ensure its records are up to date - and it
may actually be difficult to show that the processing involved in data matching or tracing for these
purposes is fair, lawful and transparent.

However, if an individual informs the organisation of a new address, it should update its records. And if a
mailing is returned with the message ‘not at this address’ marked on the envelope — or any other
information comes to light which suggests the address is no longer accurate — the organisation should
update its records to indicate that the address is no longer current.

What steps do we need to take to ensure accuracy?

Where you use your own resources to compile personal data about an individual, then you must make sure
the information is correct. You should take particular care if the information could have serious implications
for the individual. If, for example, you give an employee a pay increase on the basis of an annual increment
and a performance bonus, then there is no excuse for getting the new salary figure wrong in your payroll
records.

We recognise that it may be impractical to check the accuracy of personal data someone else provides. In
order to ensure that your records are not inaccurate or misleading in this case, you must:

@ accurately record the information provided;
® accurately record the source of the information;
@ take reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure the accuracy of the information; and

@ carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of the information.

What is a ‘reasonable step’ will depend on the circumstances and, in particular, the nature of the personal
data and what you will use it for. The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater
the effort you should put into ensuring its accuracy. So if you are using the data to make decisions that
may significantly affect the individual concerned or others, you need to put more effort into ensuring
accuracy. This may mean you have to get independent confirmation that the data is accurate. For example,
employers may need to check the precise details of job applicants’ education, qualifications and work
experience if it is essential for that particular role, when they would need to obtain authoritative
verification.

Example

An organisation recruiting a driver will want proof that the individuals they interview are entitled to
drive the type of vehicle involved. The fact that an applicant states in his work history that he worked

476


--- New Page 38 ---
Page number: 38
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

as a Father Christmas in a department store 20 years ago does not need to be checked for this
particular job.

If your information source is someone you know to be reliable, or is a well-known organisation, it is usually
reasonable to assume that they have given you accurate information. However, in some circumstances you
need to double-check - for example if inaccurate information could have serious consequences, or if
common sense suggests there may be a mistake.

Example

A business that is closing down recommends a member of staff to another organisation. Assuming the
two employers know each other, it may be reasonable for the organisation to which the
recommendation is made to accept assurances about the individual’s work experience at face value.
However, if a particular skill or qualification is needed for the new job role, the organisation needs to
make appropriate checks.

Example

An individual sends an email to her mobile phone company requesting that it changes its records about
her willingness to receive marketing material. The company amends its records accordingly without
making any checks. However, when the customer emails again asking the company to send her bills to
a new address, they carry out additional security checks before making the requested change.

Even if you originally took all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of the data, if you later get any new
information which suggests it may be wrong or misleading, you should reconsider whether it is accurate
and take steps to erase, update or correct it in light of that new information as soon as possible.

What should we do if an individual challenges the accuracy of their personal data?

If this happens, you should consider whether the information is accurate and, if it is not, you should delete
or correct it.

Remember that individuals have the absolute right to have incorrect personal data rectified - see the right
to rectification for more information.

Individuals don’t have the right to erasure just because data is inaccurate. However, the accuracy principle
requires you to take all reasonable steps to erase or rectify inaccurate data without delay, and it may be
reasonable to erase the data in some cases. If an individual asks you to delete inaccurate data it is
therefore good practice to consider this request.

Data minimisation

At a glance

You must ensure the personal data you are processing is:

@ adequate -— sufficient to properly fulfil your stated purpose;
e@ relevant — has a rational link to that purpose; and

e limited to what is necessary - you do not hold more than you need for that purpose.

Checklist

Oo We only collect personal data we actually need for our specified purposes.
O We have sufficient personal data to properly fulfil those purposes.

O We periodically review the data we hold, and delete anything we don’t need.

In brief

@ What is the data minimisation principle?

@ How do we decide what is adequate, relevant and limited?
@ When could we be processing too much personal data?

@ When could we be processing inadequate personal data?

@ What about the adequacy and relevance of opinions?

What is the data minimisation principle?

Article 5(1)(c) says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (data minimisation)”

479


--- New Page 41 ---
Page number: 41
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

So you should identify the minimum amount of personal data you need to fulfil your purpose. You should
hold that much information, but no more.

This is the first of three principles about data standards, along with accuracy and storage limitation.

The accountability principle means that you need to be able to demonstrate that you have appropriate
processes to ensure that you only collect and hold the personal data you need.

Also bear in mind that the UK GDPR says individuals have the right to complete any incomplete data which
is inadequate for your purpose, under the right to rectification. They also have right to get you to delete
any data that is not necessary for your purpose, under the right to erasure (right to be forgotten).

How do we decide what is adequate, relevant and limited?

The UK GDPR does not define these terms. Clearly, though, this will depend on your specified purpose for
collecting and using the personal data. It may also differ from one individual to another.

So, to assess whether you are holding the right amount of personal data, you must first be clear about why
you need it.

For special category data or criminal offence data, it is particularly important to make sure you collect and
retain only the minimum amount of information.

You may need to consider this separately for each individual, or for each group of individuals sharing
relevant characteristics. You should in particular consider any specific factors that an individual brings to
your attention - for example, as part of an objection, request for rectification of incomplete data, or
request for erasure of unnecessary data.

You should periodically review your processing to check that the personal data you hold is still relevant and
adequate for your purposes, and delete anything you no longer need. This is closely linked with the storage
limitation principle.

When could we be processing too much personal data?

You should not have more personal data than you need to achieve your purpose. Nor should the data
include irrelevant details.

Example

A debt collection agency is engaged to find a particular debtor. It collects information on several people
with a similar name to the debtor. During the enquiry some of these people are discounted. The agency
should delete most of their personal data, keeping only the minimum data needed to form a basic
record of a person they have removed from their search. It is appropriate to keep this small amount of
information so that these people are not contacted again about debts which do not belong to them.

If you need to process particular information about certain individuals only, you should collect it just for

480


--- New Page 42 ---
Page number: 42
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

those individuals — the information is likely to be excessive and irrelevant in relation to other people.

Example

A recruitment agency places workers in a variety of jobs. It sends applicants a general questionnaire,
which includes specific questions about health conditions that are only relevant to particular manual
occupations. It would be irrelevant and excessive to obtain such information from an individual who
was applying for an office job.

You must not collect personal data on the off-chance that it might be useful in the future. However, you
may be able to hold information for a foreseeable event that may never occur if you can justify it.

Example

An employer holds details of the blood groups of some of its employees. These employees do
hazardous work and the information is needed in case of accident. The employer has in place safety
procedures to help prevent accidents so it may be that this data is never needed, but it still needs to
hold this information in case of emergency.

If the employer holds the blood groups of the rest of the workforce, though, such information is likely
to be irrelevant and excessive as they do not engage in the same hazardous work.

If you are holding more data than is actually necessary for your purpose, this is likely to be unlawful (as
most of the lawful bases have a necessity element) as well as a breach of the data minimisation principle.
Individuals will also have the right to erasure.

When could we be processing inadequate personal data?

If the processing you carry out is not helping you to achieve your purpose then the personal data you have
is probably inadequate. You should not process personal data if it is insufficient for its intended purpose.

In some circumstances you may need to collect more personal data than you had originally anticipated
using, so that you have enough information for the purpose in question.

Example

A group of individuals set up a club. At the outset the club has only a handful of members, who all
know each other, and the club’s activities are administered using only basic information about the
members’ names and email addresses. The club proves to be very popular and its membership grows

481


--- New Page 43 ---
Page number: 43
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

rapidly. It becomes necessary to collect additional information about members so that the club can
identify them properly, and so that it can keep track of their membership status, subscription payments
etc.

Data may also be inadequate if you are making decisions about someone based on an incomplete
understanding of the facts. In particular, if an individual asks you to supplement incomplete data under
their right to rectification, this could indicate that the data might be inadequate for your purpose.

Obviously it makes no business sense to have inadequate personal data — but you must be careful not to go
too far the other way and collect more than you need.

What about the adequacy and relevance of opinions?

A record of an opinion is not necessarily inadequate or irrelevant personal data just because the individual
disagrees with it or thinks it has not taken account of information they think is important.

However, in order to be adequate, your records should make clear that it is opinion rather than fact. The
record of the opinion (or of the context it is held in) should also contain enough information to enable a
reader to interpret it correctly. For example, it should state the date and the author’s name and position.

If an opinion is likely to be controversial or very sensitive, or if it will have a significant impact when used
or disclosed, it is even more important to state the circumstances or the evidence it is based on. If a record
contains an opinion that summarises more detailed records held elsewhere, you should make this clear.

Example

A GP's record may hold only a letter from a consultant and it will be the hospital file that contains
greater detail. In this case, the record of the consultant’s opinion should contain enough information to
enable detailed records to be traced.

For more information about the accuracy of opinions, see our guidance on the accuracy principle.

What is the purpose limitation principle?

Article 5(1)(b) says:

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

“1. Personal data shall be:

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that
is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1),
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes.”

In practice, this means that you must:

e@ be clear from the outset why you are collecting personal data and what you intend to do with it;
® comply with your documentation obligations to specify your purposes;
@ comply with your transparency obligations to inform individuals about your purposes; and

@ ensure that if you plan to use or disclose personal data for any purpose that is additional to or different
from the originally specified purpose, the new use is fair, lawful and transparent.

Why do we need to specify our purposes?

This requirement aims to ensure that you are clear and open about your reasons for obtaining personal
data, and that what you do with the data is in line with the reasonable expectations of the individuals
concerned.

Specifying your purposes from the outset helps you to be accountable for your processing, and helps you
avoid ‘function creep’. It also helps individuals understand how you use their data, make decisions about
whether they are happy to share their details, and assert their rights over data where appropriate. It is
fundamental to building public trust in how you use personal data.

There are clear links with other principles — in particular, the fairness, lawfulness and transparency
principle. Being clear about why you are processing personal data will help you to ensure your processing is
fair, lawful and transparent. And if you use data for unfair, unlawful or ‘invisible’ reasons, it’s likely to be a
breach of both principles.

Specifying your purposes is necessary to comply with your accountability obligations.

How do we specify our purposes?

If you comply with your documentation and transparency obligations, you are likely to comply with the
requirement to specify your purposes without doing anything more:

e You need to specify your purpose or purposes for processing personal data within the documentation
you are required to keep as part of your records of processing (documentation) obligations under Article
30.

@ You also need to specify your purposes in your privacy information for individuals.

However, you should also remember that whatever you document, and whatever you tell people, this
cannot make fundamentally unfair processing fair and lawful.

If you are a small organisation and you are exempt from some documentation requirements, you may not
need to formally document all of your purposes to comply with the purpose limitation principle. Listing your
purposes in the privacy information you provide to individuals will be enough. However, it is still good
practice to document all of your purposes. For more information, read our documentation guidance.

 

If you have not provided privacy information because you are only using personal data for an obvious
purpose that individuals already know about, the “specified purpose” should be taken to be the obvious
purpose.

You should regularly review your processing, documentation and privacy information to check that your
purposes have not evolved over time beyond those you originally specified (‘function creep’).

Once we collect personal data for a specified purpose, can we use it for other purposes?

The UK GDPR does not ban this altogether, but there are restrictions. In essence, if your purposes change
over time or you want to use data for a new purpose which you did not originally anticipate, you can only
go ahead if:

@ the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose;

@ you get the individual’s specific consent for the new purpose; or

® you can point to a clear legal provision requiring or allowing the new processing in the public interest —

for example, a new function for a public authority.

All processing must also be lawful, so you do need a lawful basis. The original basis you used to collect the
data may not always be appropriate for your new use of that data.

If your new purpose is compatible, and your use of the data is necessary for that purpose, you can
generally be confident it will also be lawful. In most cases, the appropriate basis for your new use of the

for more information.

You need to make sure that you update your privacy information to ensure that your processing is
transparent.

What is a ‘compatible’ purpose?

The UK GDPR specifically says that the following purposes should be considered to be compatible purposes:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;
@ scientific or historical research purposes; and

e statistical purposes.

Please read our detailed guidance on the research provisions for more information.

 

Otherwise, you need to do a compatibility assessment to decide whether a new purpose is compatible with
your original purpose. The assessment should take into account:

486


--- New Page 48 ---
Page number: 48
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ any link between your original purpose and the new purpose;

@ the context in which you originally collected the personal data — in particular, your relationship with the
individual and what they would reasonably expect;

e the nature of the personal data - eg is it particularly sensitive;
@ the possible consequences for individuals of the new processing; and

@ whether there are appropriate safeguards - eg encryption or pseudonymisation.
This list is not exhaustive and what you need to look at depends on the particular circumstances.

We consider a compatibility assessment is likely to look at similar factors to a legitimate interests

help you assess compatibility.

As a general rule, if the new purpose is either very different from the original purpose, would be
unexpected, or would have an unjustified impact on the individual, it is likely to be incompatible with your
original purpose. In practice, you are likely to need to ask for specific consent to use or disclose data for
this type of purpose.

Example

A GP discloses his patient list to his wife, who runs a travel agency, so that she can offer special holiday
deals to patients needing recuperation. Disclosing the information for this purpose would be
incompatible with the purposes for which it was obtained.

What is the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle?

Article 5(1) of the UK GDPR says:

66

“1. Personal data shall be:

(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (lawfulness,
fairness, transparency’)”

There are more detailed provisions on lawfulness and having a ‘lawful basis for processing’ set out in
Articles 6 to 10.

There are more detailed transparency obligations set out in Articles 13 and 14, as part of the ‘right to be
informed’.

The three elements of lawfulness, fairness and transparency overlap, but you must make sure you satisfy
all three. It’s not enough to show your processing is lawful if it is fundamentally unfair to or hidden from
the individuals concerned.

What is lawfulness?

For processing of personal data to be lawful, you need to identify specific grounds for the processing. This is
called a ‘lawful basis’ for processing, and there are six options which depend on your purpose and your
relationship with the individual. There are also specific additional conditions for processing some especially
sensitive types of data. For more information, see the lawful basis section of this guide.

 

If no lawful basis applies then your processing will be unlawful and in breach of this principle.

Lawfulness also means that you don’t do anything with the personal data which is unlawful in a more
general sense. This includes statute and common law obligations, whether criminal or civil. If processing
involves committing a criminal offence, it will obviously be unlawful. However, processing may also be
unlawful if it results in:

@ a breach of a duty of confidence;

® your organisation exceeding its legal powers or exercising those powers improperly;

@ an infringement of copyright;

@ a breach of an enforceable contractual agreement;

@ a breach of industry-specific legislation or regulations; or

@ a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998.

498


--- New Page 52 ---
Page number: 52
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

These are just examples, and this list is not exhaustive. You may need to take your own legal advice on
other relevant legal requirements.

Although processing personal data in breach of copyright or industry regulations (for example) will involve
unlawful processing in breach of this principle, this does not mean that the ICO can pursue allegations
which are primarily about breaches of copyright, financial regulations or other laws outside our remit and
expertise as data protection regulator. In this situation there are likely to be other legal or regulatory routes
of redress where the issues can be considered in a more appropriate forum.

If you have processed personal data unlawfully, the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to erase that data
or restrict your processing of it.

What is fairness?

Processing of personal data must always be fair as well as lawful. If any aspect of your processing is unfair
you will be in breach of this principle - even if you can show that you have a lawful basis for the
processing.

In general, fairness means that you should only handle personal data in ways that people would reasonably
expect and not use it in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on them. You need to stop and think not
just about how you can use personal data, but also about whether you should.

Assessing whether you are processing information fairly depends partly on how you obtain it. In particular,
if anyone is deceived or misled when the personal data is obtained, then this is unlikely to be fair.

In order to assess whether or not you are processing personal data fairly, you must consider more
generally how it affects the interests of the people concerned — as a group and individually. If you have
obtained and used the information fairly in relation to most of the people it relates to but unfairly in relation
to one individual, there will still be a breach of this principle.

Personal data may sometimes be used in a way that negatively affects an individual without this necessarily
being unfair. What matters is whether or not such detriment is justified.

Example

Where personal data is collected to assess tax liability or to impose a fine for breaking the speed limit,
the information is being used in a way that may cause detriment to the individuals concerned, but the
proper use of personal data for these purposes will not be unfair.

You should also ensure that you treat individuals fairly when they seek to exercise their rights over their
data. This ties in with your obligation to facilitate the exercise of individuals’ rights. Read our guidance on
rights for more information.

What is transparency?

Transparency is fundamentally linked to fairness. Transparent processing is about being clear, open and

491


--- New Page 53 ---
Page number: 53
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

honest with people from the start about who you are, and how and why you use their personal data.

Transparency is always important, but especially in situations where individuals have a choice about
whether they wish to enter into a relationship with you. If individuals know at the outset what you will use
their information for, they will be able to make an informed decision about whether to enter into a
relationship, or perhaps to try to renegotiate the terms of that relationship.

Transparency is important even when you have no direct relationship with the individual and collect their
personal data from another source. In some cases, it can be even more important - as individuals may
have no idea that you are collecting and using their personal data, and this affects their ability to assert
their rights over their data. This is sometimes known as ‘invisible processing’.

You must ensure that you tell individuals about your processing in a way that is easily accessible and easy
to understand. You must use clear and plain language.

For more detail on your transparency obligations and the privacy information you must provide to

Lawful basis for processing

At a glance

@ You must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data.

e@ There are six available lawful bases for processing. No single basis is ‘better’ or more important than the
others — which basis is most appropriate to use will depend on your purpose and relationship with the
individual.

e Most lawful bases require that processing is ‘necessary’ for a specific purpose. If you can reasonably
achieve the same purpose without the processing, you won’t have a lawful basis.

e You must determine your lawful basis before you begin processing, and you should document it. We
have an interactive tool to help you.

@ Take care to get it right first time - you should not swap to a different lawful basis at a later date without
good reason. In particular, you cannot usually swap from consent to a different basis.

@ Your privacy notice should include your lawful basis for processing as well as the purposes of the
processing.

e If your purposes change, you need to consider whether you need a new lawful basis.

e If you are processing special category data you need to identify both a lawful basis for general
processing and an additional condition for processing this type of data.

What are the lawful bases for processing?

The lawful bases for processing are set out in Article 6 of the UK GDPR. At least one of these must apply
whenever you process personal data:

(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific
purpose.

(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they
have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.

(c) Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual
obligations).

(d) Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone's life.

(e) Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your
official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.

(f) Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate
interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which
overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to
perform your official tasks.)

For more detail on each lawful basis, read the specific page of this guide.

When is processing ‘necessary’?

Many of the lawful bases for processing depend on the processing being “necessary”. This does not mean
that processing has to be absolutely essential. However, it must be more than just useful, and more than
just standard practice. It must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving a specific purpose. The
lawful basis will not apply if you can reasonably achieve the purpose by some other less intrusive means, or
by processing less data.

It is not enough to argue that processing is necessary because you have chosen to operate your business in
a particular way. The question is whether the processing is objectively necessary for the stated purpose,
not whether it is a necessary part of your chosen methods.

Why is the lawful basis for processing important?

The first principle requires that you process all personal data lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. If
no lawful basis applies to your processing, your processing will be unlawful and in breach of the first
principle.

Individuals also have the right to erase personal data which has been processed unlawfully.

The individual’s right to be informed under Article 13 and 14 requires you to provide people with
information about your lawful basis for processing. This means you need to include these details in your
privacy notice.

The lawful basis for your processing can also affect which rights are available to individuals. For example,
some rights will not apply:

 

Right to Right to Right to
erasure portability object
x
Consent but right to

withdraw consent

Contract x
Legal obligation x x x
Vital interests x x
Public task x x
Legitimate x
Interests

However, an individual always has the right to object to processing for the purposes of direct marketing,
whatever lawful basis applies.

The remaining rights are not always absolute, and there are other rights which may be affected in other
ways. For example, your lawful basis may affect how provisions relating to automated decisions and

495

profiling apply, and if you are relying on legitimate interests you need more detail in your privacy notice.

subject) @

How do we decide which lawful basis applies?

This depends on your specific purposes and the context of the processing. You should think about why you
want to process the data, and consider which lawful basis best fits the circumstances. You can use our
interactive guidance tool to help you.

 

You might consider that more than one basis applies, in which case you should identify and document all of
them from the start.

You must not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. No one basis should be seen as always better, safer or
more important than the others, and there is no hierarchy in the order of the list in the UK GDPR.

Several of the lawful bases relate to a particular specified purpose - a legal obligation, performing a
contract with the individual, protecting someone’s vital interests, or performing your public tasks. If you are
processing for these purposes then the appropriate lawful basis may well be obvious, so it is helpful to
consider these first.

In other cases you are likely to have a choice between using legitimate interests or consent. You need to
give some thought to the wider context, including:

@ Who does the processing benefit?

@ Would individuals expect this processing to take place?

@ What is your relationship with the individual?

@ Are you in a position of power over them?

@ What is the impact of the processing on the individual?

@ Are they vulnerable?

e Are some of the individuals concerned likely to object?

e Are you able to stop the processing at any time on request?
You may prefer to consider legitimate interests as your lawful basis if you wish to keep control over the
processing and take responsibility for demonstrating that it is in line with people’s reasonable expectations
and wouldn't have an unwarranted impact on them. On the other hand, if you prefer to give individuals full

control over and responsibility for their data (including the ability to change their mind as to whether it can
continue to be processed), you may want to consider relying on individuals’ consent.

In more detail

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

We have produced the lawful basis interactive guidance tool, to give more tailored guidance on which
lawful basis is likely to be most appropriate for your processing activities.

 

Is this different for public authorities?

The basic approach is the same. You should think about your purposes, and choose whichever basis fits

The public task basis is more likely to be relevant to much of what you do. If you are a public authority and
can demonstrate that the processing is to perform your tasks as set down in UK law, then you are able to
use the public task basis. But if it is for another purpose, you can still consider another basis.

In particular, you may still be able to consider consent or legitimate interests in some cases, depending on
the nature of the processing and your relationship with the individual. There is no absolute ban on public
authorities using consent or legitimate interests as their lawful basis, although there are some limitations.
For more information, see the specific guidance page on each lawful basis.

The Data Protection Act 2018 says that ‘public authority’ here means a public authority under the Freedom
of Information Act or Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act - with the exception of parish and community
councils.

Example

A university that wants to process personal data may consider a variety of lawful bases depending on
what it wants to do with the data.

Universities are classified as public authorities, so the public task basis is likely to apply to much of
their processing, depending on the detail of their constitutions and legal powers. If the processing is
separate from their tasks as a public authority, then the university may instead wish to consider
whether consent or legitimate interests are appropriate in the particular circumstances. For example, a
University might rely on public task for processing personal data for teaching and research purposes;
but a mixture of legitimate interests and consent for alumni relations and fundraising purposes.

The university however needs to consider its basis carefully —- it is the controller’s responsibility to be
able to demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the particular processing purpose.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must determine your lawful basis before starting to process personal data. It’s important to get this
right first time. If you find at a later date that your chosen basis was actually inappropriate, it will be
difficult to simply swap to a different one. Even if a different basis could have applied from the start,
retrospectively switching lawful basis is likely to be inherently unfair to the individual and lead to breaches
of accountability and transparency requirements.

Example

A company decided to process on the basis of consent, and obtained consent from individuals. An
individual subsequently decided to withdraw their consent to the processing of their data, as is their
right. However, the company wanted to keep processing the data so decided to continue the processing
on the basis of legitimate interests.

Even if it could have originally relied on legitimate interests, the company cannot do so at a later date -
it cannot switch basis when it realised that the original chosen basis was inappropriate (in this case,
because it did not want to offer the individual genuine ongoing control). It should have made clear to
the individual from the start that it was processing on the basis of legitimate interests. Leading the
individual to believe they had a choice is inherently unfair if that choice will be irrelevant. The company
must therefore stop processing when the individual withdraws consent.

It is therefore important to thoroughly assess upfront which basis is appropriate and document this. It may
be possible that more than one basis applies to the processing because you have more than one purpose,
and if this is the case then you should make this clear from the start.

If there is a genuine change in circumstances or you have a new and unanticipated purpose which means
there is a good reason to review your lawful basis and make a change, you need to inform the individual
and document the change.

What happens if we have a new purpose?

If your purposes change over time or you have a new purpose which you did not originally anticipate, you
need to comply with the purpose limitation principle. In summary, you can only go ahead if:

@ the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose;

@ you get the individual’s specific consent for the new purpose; or

® you can point to a clear legal provision requiring or allowing the new processing in the public interest —

for example, a new function for a public authority.

For more information on compatibility, see our purpose limitation guidance.

All processing must be lawful, so you also need to identify a lawful basis. The original basis you used to
collect the data may not always be appropriate for your new use of the data.

In most cases, the appropriate basis for your new use of the data is likely to be fairly obvious. For example,
if you are getting specific consent for the new purpose, your lawful basis will be consent. If you are relying
on a legal provision requiring the new processing in the public interest, your lawful basis will be legal
obligation. If you are relying on a legal provision allowing the new use of data in the public interest, your
lawful basis will be public task.

Where the purpose for your new processing activity is compatible with the original purpose for the
processing, you are likely to be able to rely on “legitimate interests” as the lawful basis for the new
processing, provided your use of the personal data is necessary for that purpose.

We consider a compatibility assessment is likely to look at similar factors to a legitimate interests

help you assess compatibility.This will also help demonstrate your lawful basis at the same time.

If your new processing is for research purposes, you do not need to carry out a compatibility assessment,
and in most circumstances you can be confident that your lawful basis is likely to be either public task or

However, if you originally collected the data on the basis of consent, you should get fresh consent which
specifically covers the new purpose (unless you are relying on a clear legal provision specifically permitting
your reuse of the data). This is because consent means giving individuals real choice and control over how
their data is used. This means that consent must always be specific and informed. People can only give
valid consent when they know and understand what you are going to do with their data. If you do get
specific consent for the new purpose, you do not need to show it is compatible.

If you are processing special category data, you will also need to ensure that you can identify an
appropriate condition which applies to your new processing.

How should we document our lawful basis?

The principle of accountability requires you to be able to demonstrate that you are complying with the

UK GDPR, and have appropriate policies and processes. This means that you need to be able to show that
you have properly considered which lawful basis applies to each processing purpose and can justify your
decision.

You need therefore to keep a record of which basis you are relying on for each processing purpose, and a
justification for why you believe it applies. There is no standard form for this, as long as you ensure that
what you record is sufficient to demonstrate that a lawful basis applies. This will help you comply with
accountability obligations, and will also help you when writing your privacy notices.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you can demonstrate which lawful basis applies to the particular

What do we need to tell people?

You need to include information about your lawful basis (or bases, if more than one applies) in your privacy
notice. Under the transparency provisions of the UK GDPR, the information you need to give people
includes:

e the lawful basis for the processing.

This applies whether you collect the personal data directly from the individual or you collect their data from
another source.

GDPR.

What about special category data?

If you are processing special category data, you need to identify both a lawful basis for processing and a
special category condition for processing in compliance with Article 9. You should document both your
lawful basis for processing and your special category condition so that you can demonstrate compliance and
accountability.

What about criminal offence data?

If you are processing data about criminal convictions, criminal offences or related security measures, you
need both a lawful basis for processing, and either ‘official authority’ or a separate condition for processing
this data in compliance with Article 10. You should document both your lawful basis for processing and your
criminal offence data condition so that you can demonstrate compliance and accountability.

07 October 2022 - We have updated our position on needing a new lawful basis when your purpose
for processing changes. The update can be found under the ‘What happens if we have a new purpose?’
section. You now need to consider whether you need a new lawful basis if your purposes for processing
personal data change.

Criminal offence data

At a glance

@ The UK GDPR gives extra protection to the personal data of offenders or suspected offenders in the
context of criminal activity, allegations, investigations, and proceedings.

e If you have official authority, you can process personal data about criminal convictions and offences,
because you are processing the data in an official capacity.

@ If you do not have official authority, you can only process criminal offence data if you can identify a
specific condition for processing in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.

@ You cannot keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions, unless you do so in an official
capacity.

@ You must determine your condition for processing criminal offence data, or identify your official authority
for the processing, before you begin the processing, and you should document this.

e You must still have a lawful basis for your processing under Article 6.

@ In many cases, you also need an ‘appropriate policy document @” in place in order to meet a UK
Schedule 1 condition for processing in the DPA 2018.

® You need to complete a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for any type of processing which is
likely to be high risk. You must therefore be aware of the risks of processing the criminal offence data.

@ In more detail

What is criminal offence data?

The UK GDPR gives extra protection to “personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or
related security measures”. We refer to this as criminal offence data.

This covers a wide range of information about offenders or suspected offenders in the context of:

® criminal activity;

@ allegations;

@ investigations; and
® proceedings.

It includes not just data which is obviously about a specific criminal conviction or trial, but may also include
personal data about:

503


--- New Page 65 ---
Page number: 65
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® unproven allegations; and

@ e information relating to the absence of convictions.
It also covers a wide range of related security measures, including

® personal data about penalties;

@ conditions or restrictions placed on an individual as part of the criminal justice process; or

e civil measures which may lead to a criminal penalty if not adhered to.

It does not cover information about other individuals, including victims and witnesses of crime. However,

information about victims and witnesses is likely to be sensitive, and controllers should take particular care
when processing it.

What are the rules for criminal offence data?

You must always ensure that your processing is generally lawful, fair and transparent and complies with all
the other principles and requirements of the UK GDPR. To ensure that your processing is lawful, you need
to identify an Article 6 basis for processing.

In addition, you can only process criminal offence data if the processing is either:

®@ under the control of official authority; or

® authorised by domestic law. This means you need to meet one of the conditions in Schedule 1 @ of the
DPA 2018.

You may only keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions if this register is “under the control of
official authority”.

Public bodies, or private bodies who are given public sector tasks, may have “official authority” to process
criminal offence data. This official authority may derive from either common law or statute. If you area
public body, you must identify the specific law that gives you official authority to process criminal offence
data.

If you do not have official authority for the processing, it must be authorised by domestic law. This
authorisation in law is set out in the conditions listed in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018 @.

 

You must also identify whether you need an “appropriate policy document” under the DPA 2018. Our
template appropriate policy document @ shows the kind of information this should contain.

 

You must do a DPIA for any type of processing that is likely to be high risk. This means that you are more
likely to need to do a DPIA for processing criminal offence data. For further information, please see our

You should also consider how the risks associated with criminal offence data affect your other obligations -
in particular, obligations around data minimisation, security, transparency, and DPOs.

What are the Schedule 1 conditions for processing criminal offence data?

Special category data

At a glance

@ Special category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive.

e In order to lawfully process special category data, you must identify both a lawful basis under Article 6
of the UK GDPR and a separate condition for processing under Article 9. These do not have to be linked.

e There are 10 conditions for processing special category data in Article 9 of the UK GDPR.

@ Five of these require you to meet additional conditions and safeguards set out in UK law, in Schedule 1
of the DPA 2018.

@ You must determine your condition for processing special category data before you begin this processing
under the UK GDPR, and you should document it.

e@ In many cases you also need an ‘appropriate policy document @” in place in order to meet a UK
Schedule 1 condition for processing in the DPA 2018.

 

@ You need to complete a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for any type of processing which is

In brief

@ What is special category data?

@ What are the rules for special category data?

@ What are the conditions for processing special category data?
@ What are the substantial public interest conditions?

@ In more detail

What is special category data?

The UK GDPR defines special category data as:

® personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;

® personal data revealing political opinions;

@ personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;
® personal data revealing trade union membership;

e genetic data;

e biometric data (where used for identification purposes);

@ data concerning health;

e data concerning a person’s sex life; and

e data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.

This does not include personal data about criminal allegations, proceedings or convictions, as separate rules

Special category data includes personal data revealing or concerning the above types of data. Therefore,
if you have inferred or guessed details about someone which fall into one of the above categories, this data
may count as special category data. It depends on how certain that inference is, and whether you are
deliberately drawing that inference.

What are the rules for special category data?

You must always ensure that your processing is generally lawful, fair and transparent and complies with all
the other principles and requirements of the UK GDPR. To ensure that your processing is lawful, you need
to identify an Article 6 basis for processing.

In addition, you can only process special category data if you can meet one of the specific conditions in
Article 9 of the UK GDPR. You need to consider the purposes of your processing and identify which of these
conditions are relevant.

508


--- New Page 70 ---
Page number: 70
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Five of the conditions for processing are provided solely in Article 9 of the UK GDPR. The other five require
authorisation or a basis in UK law, which means you need to meet additional conditions set out in the DPA
2018.

You must also identify whether you need an ‘appropriate policy document’ under the DPA 2018. Our
template appropriate policy document @ shows the kind of information this should contain.

 

You must do a DPIA for any type of processing that is likely to be high risk. This means that you are more
likely to need to do a DPIA for processing special category data. For further information, please see our

If you process special category data you must keep records, including documenting the categories of data.
You may also need to consider how the risks associated with special category data affect your other
obligations — in particular, obligations around data minimisation, security, transparency, DPOs and rights
related to automated decision-making.

What are the conditions for processing special category data?

Article 9 lists the conditions for processing special category data:

(a) Explicit consent

(b) Employment, social security and social protection (if authorised by law)
(c) Vital interests

(d) Not-for-profit bodies

(e) Made public by the data subject

(f) Legal claims or judicial acts

(g) Reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law)

(h) Health or social care (with a basis in law)

(i) Public health (with a basis in law)

(j) Archiving, research and statistics (with a basis in law)

If you are relying on conditions (b), (h), (i) or (j), you also need to meet the associated condition in UK
law, set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018 CG.

 

If you are relying on the substantial public interest condition in Article 9(2)(g), you also need to meet one
of 23 specific substantial public interest conditions set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.

What are the substantial public interest conditions?

The 23 substantial public interest conditions are set out in paragraphs 6 to 28 of Schedule 1 of the DPA
2018:

6. Statutory and government purposes

7. Administration of justice and parliamentary purposes
8. Equality of opportunity or treatment

9. Racial and ethnic diversity at senior levels

10. Preventing or detecting unlawful acts

11. Protecting the public

12. Regulatory requirements

509

24. Disclosure to elected representatives

25. Informing elected representatives about prisoners

26. Publication of legal judgments

27. Anti-doping in sport

28. Standards of behaviour in sport

You should identify which of these conditions appears to most closely reflect your purpose. Our detailed
guidance gives you some further advice on how the conditions generally work, but you always need to refer
to the detailed provisions of each condition @ in the legislation itself to make sure you can demonstrate it
applies.

 

For some of these conditions, the substantial public interest element is built in. For others, you need to be
able to demonstrate that your specific processing is “necessary for reasons of substantial public interest”,
on a case-by-case basis.

The public interest covers a wide range of values and principles relating to the public good, or what is in the
best interests of society. It needs to be real and of substance. Given the inherent risks of special category
data, it is not enough to make a vague or generic public interest argument. You should be able to make
specific arguments about the concrete wider benefits of your processing.

For some of the conditions, you also need to justify why you cannot give individuals a choice and get
explicit consent for your processing. In most cases, you must have an ‘appropriate policy document @” in
place.

Legitimate interests

At a glance

e Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always
be the most appropriate.

e It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect
and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.

e@ If you choose to rely on legitimate interests, you are taking on extra responsibility for considering and
protecting people’s rights and interests.

e@ Public authorities can only rely on legitimate interests if they are processing for a legitimate reason
other than performing their tasks as a public authority.

e There are three elements to the legitimate interests basis. It helps to think of this as a three-part test.
You need to:

@ identify a legitimate interest;
e show that the processing is necessary to achieve it; and
@ balance it against the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms.
e The legitimate interests can be your own interests or the interests of third parties. They can include
commercial interests, individual interests or broader societal benefits.

e The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably achieve the same result in another less
intrusive way, legitimate interests will not apply.

e@ You must balance your interests against the individual’s. If they would not reasonably expect the
processing, or if it would cause unjustified harm, their interests are likely to override your legitimate
interests.

@ Keep a record of your legitimate interests assessment (LIA) to help you demonstrate compliance if
required.

@ You must include details of your legitimate interests in your privacy information.

In brief

@ What is the ‘legitimate interests' basis?

@ When can we rely on legitimate interests?

@ How can we apply legitimate interests in practice?
@ What else do we need to consider?

e@ In detail

What is the ‘legitimate interests’ basis?

Article 6(1)(f) gives you a lawful basis for processing where:

“processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
third party except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data
subject is a child.”

This can be broken down into a three-part test:

1. Purpose test: are you pursuing a legitimate interest?

513


--- New Page 75 ---
Page number: 75
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

2. Necessity test: is the processing necessary for that purpose?

3. Balancing test: do the individual’s interests override the legitimate interest?

A wide range of interests may be legitimate interests. They can be your own interests or the interests of
third parties, and commercial interests as well as wider societal benefits. They may be compelling or trivial,
but trivial interests may be more easily overridden in the balancing test.

The UK GDPR specifically mentions use of client or employee data, marketing, fraud prevention, intra-group
transfers, or IT security as potential legitimate interests, but this is not an exhaustive list. It also says that
you have a legitimate interest in disclosing information about possible criminal acts or security threats to
the authorities.

‘Necessary’ means that the processing must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving your
purpose. You cannot rely on legitimate interests if there is another reasonable and less intrusive way to
achieve the same result.

You must balance your interests against the individual’s interests. In particular, if they would not reasonably
expect you to use data in that way, or it would cause them unwarranted harm, their interests are likely to
override yours. However, your interests do not always have to align with the individual’s interests. If there
is a conflict, your interests can still prevail as long as there is a clear justification for the impact on the
individual.

When can we rely on legitimate interests?

Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis, but you cannot assume it will always be appropriate
for all of your processing.

If you choose to rely on legitimate interests, you take on extra responsibility for ensuring people’s rights
and interests are fully considered and protected.

Legitimate interests is most likely to be an appropriate basis where you use data in ways that people would
reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact. Where there is an impact on individuals, it may
still apply if you can show there is an even more compelling benefit to the processing and the impact is
justified.

You can rely on legitimate interests for marketing activities if you can show that how you use people’s data
is proportionate, has a minimal privacy impact, and people would not be surprised or likely to object - but

electronic marketing.

You can consider legitimate interests for processing children’s data, but you must take extra care to make
sure their interests are protected. See our detailed guidance on children and the UK GDPR.

 

You may be able to rely on legitimate interests in order to lawfully disclose personal data to a third party.
You should consider why they want the information, whether they actually need it, and what they will do
with it. You need to demonstrate that the disclosure is justified, but it will be their responsibility to
determine their lawful basis for their own processing.

You should avoid using legitimate interests if you are using personal data in ways people do not understand
and would not reasonably expect, or if you think some people would object if you explained it to them. You

514


--- New Page 76 ---
Page number: 76
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

should also avoid this basis for processing that could cause harm, unless you are confident there is
nevertheless a compelling reason to go ahead which justifies the impact.

If you are a public authority, you cannot rely on legitimate interests for any processing you do to perform
your tasks as a public authority. However, if you have other legitimate purposes outside the scope of your
tasks as a public authority, you can consider legitimate interests where appropriate. This will be particularly
relevant for public authorities with commercial interests.

See our guidance page on the lawful basis for more information on the alternatives to legitimate interests,
and how to decide which basis to choose.

 

How can we apply legitimate interests in practice?

If you want to rely on legitimate interests, you can use the three-part test to assess whether it applies. We
refer to this as a legitimate interests assessment (LIA) and you should do it before you start the
processing.

An LIA is a type of light-touch risk assessment based on the specific context and circumstances. It will help
you ensure that your processing is lawful. Recording your LIA will also help you demonstrate compliance in
line with your accountability obligations under Articles 5(2) and 24. In some cases an LIA will be quite
short, but in others there will be more to consider.

First, identify the legitimate interest(s). Consider:

@ Why do you want to process the data - what are you trying to achieve?
@ Who benefits from the processing? In what way?

e Are there any wider public benefits to the processing?

@ How important are those benefits?

@ What would the impact be if you couldn’t go ahead?

@ Would your use of the data be unethical or unlawful in any way?
Second, apply the necessity test. Consider:

® Does this processing actually help to further that interest?

@ Is it a reasonable way to go about it?

e@ Is there another less intrusive way to achieve the same result?
Third, do a balancing test. Consider the impact of your processing and whether this overrides the interest
you have identified. You might find it helpful to think about the following:

@ What is the nature of your relationship with the individual?

@ Is any of the data particularly sensitive or private?

@ Would people expect you to use their data in this way?

@ Are you happy to explain it to them?

@ Are some people likely to object or find it intrusive?

@ What is the possible impact on the individual?

515


--- New Page 77 ---
Page number: 77
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ How big an impact might it have on them?

e Are you processing children’s data?

@ Are any of the individuals vulnerable in any other way?
@ Can you adopt any safeguards to minimise the impact?

® Can you offer an opt-out?

You then need to make a decision about whether you still think legitimate interests is an appropriate basis.
There’s no foolproof formula for the outcome of the balancing test — but you must be confident that your
legitimate interests are not overridden by the risks you have identified.

Keep a record of your LIA and the outcome. There is no standard format for this, but it’s important to
record your thinking to help show you have proper decision-making processes in place and to justify the
outcome.

Keep your LIA under review and refresh it if there is a significant change in the purpose, nature or context
of the processing.

If you are not sure about the outcome of the balancing test, it may be safer to look for another lawful
basis. Legitimate interests will not often be the most appropriate basis for processing which is unexpected
or high risk.

If your LIA identifies significant risks, consider whether you need to do a DPIA to assess the risk and

What else do we need to consider?

You must tell people in your privacy information that you are relying on legitimate interests, and explain
what these interests are.

If you want to process the personal data for a new purpose, you may be able to continue processing under
legitimate interests as long as your new purpose is compatible with your original purpose. We would still
recommend that you conduct a new LIA, as this will help you demonstrate compatibility.

If you rely on legitimate interests, the right to data portability does not apply.

If you are relying on legitimate interests for direct marketing, the right to object is absolute and you must
stop processing when someone objects. For other purposes, you must stop unless you can show that your
legitimate interests are compelling enough to override the individual’s rights. See our guidance on
individual rights for more on this.

Our legitimate interests assessment (LIA) template @ is designed to help you to decide whether or not the
legitimate interests basis is likely to apply to your processing.

We have produced the lawful basis interactive guidance tool, to give tailored guidance on which lawful
basis is likely to be most appropriate for your processing activities.

 

In more detail - European Data Protection Board

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party (WP29),
includes representatives from the data protection authorities of each EU member state. It adopts
guidelines for complying with the requirements of the UK GDPR. EDPB guidelines will no longer be
directly relevant to the UK regime and will not be binding under the UK regime. However, they may still
provide helpful guidance on certain issues.

Opinion 06/2014 (9 April 2014) gives detailed guidance on the key elements of the similar legitimate
interests provisions under the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.

Public task

At a glance

@ You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process personal data:

@ ‘in the exercise of official authority’. This covers public functions and powers that are set out in law;
or

@ to perform a specific task in the public interest that is set out in law.
e It is most relevant to public authorities, but it can apply to any organisation that exercises official
authority or carries out tasks in the public interest.

e You do not need a specific statutory power to process personal data, but your underlying task, function
or power must have a clear basis in law.

e The processing must be necessary. If you could reasonably perform your tasks or exercise your powers
in a less intrusive way, this lawful basis does not apply.

e Document your decision to rely on this basis to help you demonstrate compliance if required. You should
be able to specify the relevant task, function or power, and identify its statutory or common law basis.

In brief

@ What is the ‘public task’ basis?

@ What does ‘laid down by law’ mean?
@ Who can rely on this basis?

@ When can we rely on this basis?

@ What else should we consider?

What is the ‘public task’ basis?

Article 6(1)(e) gives you a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller”

This can apply if you are either:

® carrying out a specific task in the public interest which is laid down by law; or

® exercising official authority (for example, a public body’s tasks, functions, duties or powers) which is laid
down by law.

518


--- New Page 80 ---
Page number: 80
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you can show you are exercising official authority, including use of discretionary powers, there is no
additional public interest test. However, you must be able to demonstrate that the processing is ‘necessary’
for that purpose.

‘Necessary’ means that the processing must be a targeted and proportionate way of achieving your
purpose. You do not have a lawful basis for processing if there is another reasonable and less intrusive way
to achieve the same result.

In this guide we use the term ‘public task’ to help describe and label this lawful basis. However, this is not a
term used in the UK GDPR itself. Your focus should be on demonstrating either that you are carrying out a
task in the public interest, or that you are exercising official authority.

In particular, there is no direct link to the concept of ‘public task’ in the Re-use of Public Sector Information
Regulations 2015 (RPSI). There is some overlap, as a public sector body’s core role and functions for RPSI
purposes may be a useful starting point in demonstrating official authority for these purposes. However,

context of RPSI.

What does ‘laid down by law’ mean?

Article 6(3) requires that the relevant task or authority must be laid down by domestic law. This will most
often be a statutory function. However, Recital 41 clarifies that this does not have to be an explicit statutory
provision, as long as the application of the law is clear and foreseeable. This means that it includes clear
common law tasks, functions or powers as well as those set out in statute or statutory guidance.

You do not need specific legal authority for the particular processing activity. The point is that your overall
purpose must be to perform a public interest task or exercise official authority, and that overall task or
authority has a sufficiently clear basis in law.

Who can rely on this basis?

Any controller who is exercising official authority or carrying out a specific task in the public interest. The
focus is on the nature of the function, not the nature of the organisation.

Example

Private water companies are likely to be able to rely on the public task basis even if they do not fall
within the definition of a public authority in the Data Protection Act 2018. This is because they are
considered to be carrying out functions of public administration and they exercise special legal powers
to carry out utility services in the public interest. See our guidance on Public authorities under the EIR
for more details.

 

However, if you are a private sector organisation you are likely to be able to consider the legitimate
interests basis as an alternative.

See the main lawful basis page of this guide for more on how to choose the most appropriate basis.

When can we rely on this basis?

Section 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) says that the public task basis will cover processing
necessary for:

@ the administration of justice;

® parliamentary functions;

e statutory functions;

® governmental functions; or

@ activities that support or promote democratic engagement.

However, this is not intended as an exhaustive list. If you have other official non-statutory functions or

public interest tasks you can still rely on the public task basis, as long as the underlying legal basis for that
function or task is clear and foreseeable.

For accountability purposes, you should be able to specify the relevant task, function or power, and identify
its basis in common law or statute. You should also ensure that you can demonstrate there is no other
reasonable and less intrusive means to achieve your purpose.

You may share personal information with another controller or individual in the lawful exercise of any of
your public tasks, functions or powers, if it is a clear and foreseeable use of the information. In order to do
so, you should be able to identify the relevant legal basis you are subject to.

However, you cannot rely on another controller’s public tasks, functions or powers as the lawful basis for
your processing, including disclosing personal data to them, as this is not a clear and foreseeable use of the
information.

Example

A government agency has statutory powers to conduct research about the online shopping habits of
consumers. The agency asks retailers to share the personal data of a random sample of their
customers to enable it to carry out this function. It explains that it will process the data under ‘public
task’ once it receives the information.

As the retailers are not subject to the agency’s statutory function, they cannot share the information on
the basis of the agency’s public task. However, they may consider disclosing the information under
another lawful basis, eg legitimate interests.

What else should we consider?

Individuals’ rights to erasure and data portability do not apply if you are processing on the basis of public

520


--- New Page 82 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

task. However, individuals do have a right to object. See our guidance on individual rights for more
information.

You should consider an alternative lawful basis if you are not confident that processing is necessary for a
relevant task, function or power which is clearly set out in law.

If you are a public authority (as defined in the Data Protection Act 2018), your ability to rely on consent or
legitimate interests as an alternative basis is more limited, but they may be available in some
circumstances. In particular, legitimate interests is still available for processing which falls outside your
tasks as a public authority. Other lawful bases may also be relevant. See our guidance on the other lawful
bases for more information.

Remember that the UK GDPR specifically says that further processing for certain purposes should be
considered to be compatible with your original purpose. This means that if you originally processed the
personal data for a relevant task or function, you do not need a separate lawful basis for any further
processing for:

@ archiving purposes in the public interest;

e scientific research purposes; or

e statistical purposes.

If you are processing special category data, you also need to identify an additional condition for processing
this type of data. The Data Protection Act 2018 includes specific conditions for parliamentary, statutory or

governmental functions in the substantial public interest. Read the special category data page of this guide
for our latest guidance on these provisions.

To help you meet your accountability and transparency obligations, remember to:

@ document your decision that the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest
or exercise your official authority;

@ identify the relevant task or authority and its basis in common law or statute; and
@ include basic information about your purposes and lawful basis in your privacy notice.

Vital interests

At a glance

@ You are likely to be able to rely on vital interests as your lawful basis if you need to process the personal
data to protect someone’s life.

@ The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably protect the person’s vital interests in another
less intrusive way, this basis will not apply.

@ You cannot rely on vital interests for health data or other special category data if the individual is
capable of giving consent, even if they refuse their consent.

e@ You should consider whether you are likely to rely on this basis, and if so document the circumstances
where it will be relevant and ensure you can justify your reasoning.

In brief

@ What does the UK GDPR say?
@ What are ‘vital interests’?
@ When is the vital interests basis likely to apply?

@ What else should we consider?

What does the UK GDPR say?

Article 6(1)(d) provides a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
person”.

Recital 46 provides some further guidance:

66

“The processing of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an
interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing
of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only
where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis...”

What are ‘vital interests’?

523


--- New Page 85 ---
Page number: 85
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

It’s clear from Recital 46 that vital interests are intended to cover only interests that are essential for
someone's life. So this lawful basis is very limited in its scope, and generally only applies to matters of life
and death.

When is the vital interests basis likely to apply?

It is likely to be particularly relevant for emergency medical care, when you need to process personal data
for medical purposes but the individual is incapable of giving consent to the processing.

Example

An individual is admitted to the A & E department of a hospital with life-threatening injuries following a
serious road accident. The disclosure to the hospital of the individual’s medical history is necessary in
order to protect his/her vital interests.

It is less likely to be appropriate for medical care that is planned in advance. Another lawful basis such as
public task or legitimate interests is likely to be more appropriate in this case.

Processing of one individual’s personal data to protect the vital interests of others is likely to happen more
rarely. It may be relevant, for example, if it is necessary to process a parent’s personal data to protect the
vital interests of a child.

Vital interests is also less likely to be the appropriate basis for processing on a larger scale. Recital 46 does
suggest that vital interests might apply where you are processing on humanitarian grounds such as
monitoring epidemics, or where there is a natural or man-made disaster causing a humanitarian
emergency.

However, if you are processing one person’s personal data to protect someone else’s life, Recital 46 also
indicates that you should generally try to use an alternative lawful basis, unless none is obviously available.
For example, in many cases you could consider legitimate interests, which will give you a framework to
balance the rights and interests of the data subject(s) with the vital interests of the person or people you
are trying to protect.

What else should we consider?

In most cases the protection of vital interests is likely to arise in the context of health data. This is one of
the special categories of data, which means you will also need to identify a condition for processing special
category data under Article 9.

There is a specific condition at Article 9(2)(c) for processing special category data where necessary to
protect someone’s vital interests. However, this only applies if the data subject is physically or legally
incapable of giving consent. This means explicit consent is more appropriate in many cases, and you cannot
in practice rely on vital interests for special category data (including health data) if the data subject refuses
consent, unless they are not competent to do so.

Legal obligation

At a glance

or statutory obligation.

@ This does not apply to contractual obligations.

e The processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably comply without processing the personal data,
this basis does not apply.

@ You should document your decision to rely on this lawful basis and ensure that you can justify your

guidance that clearly sets out your obligation.

In brief

@ When is the lawful basis for legal obligations likely to apply?
e@ When is processing ‘necessary’ for compliance?

@ What else should we consider?

What does the UK GDPR say?

Article 6(1)(c) provides a lawful basis for processing where:

66

“processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.”

When is the lawful basis for legal obligations likely to apply?

In short, when you are obliged to process the personal data to comply with the law.

Article 6(3) requires that the legal obligation must be laid down by UK or EU law. Recital 41 confirms that
this does not have to be an explicit statutory obligation, as long as the application of the law is foreseeable
to those individuals subject to it. So it includes clear common law obligations.

This does not mean that there must be a legal obligation specifically requiring the specific processing
activity. The point is that your overall purpose must be to comply with a legal obligation which has a
sufficiently clear basis in either common law or statute.

You should be able to identify the obligation in question, either by reference to the specific legal provision

526


--- New Page 88 ---
Page number: 88
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

or else by pointing to an appropriate source of advice or guidance that sets it out clearly. For example, you
can refer to a government website or to industry guidance that explains generally applicable legal
obligations.

Example

An employer needs to process personal data to comply with its legal obligation to disclose employee
salary details to HMRC.

The employer can point to the HMRC website where the requirements are set out to demonstrate this
obligation. In this situation it is not necessary to cite each specific piece of legislation.

Example

A financial institution relies on the legal obligation imposed by the Part 7 of Proceeds of Crime Act 2002
to process personal data in order submit a Suspicious Activity Report to the National Crime Agency
when it Knows or suspects that a person is engaged in, or attempting, money laundering.

Example

A court order may require you to process personal data for a particular purpose and this also qualifies
as a legal obligation.

Regulatory requirements also qualify as a legal obligation for these purposes where there is a statutory
basis underpinning the regulatory regime and which requires regulated organisations to comply.

527


--- New Page 89 ---
Page number: 89
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has powers under The Enterprise Act 2002 to make
orders to remedy adverse effects on competition, some of which may require the processing of
personal data.

A retail energy supplier passes customer data to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to comply
with the CMA’s Energy Market Investigation (Database) Order 2016. The supplier may rely on legal
obligation as the lawful basis for this processing.

A contractual obligation does not comprise a legal obligation in this context. You cannot contract out of the
requirement for a lawful basis. However, you can look for a different lawful basis. If the contract is with the
individual you can consider the lawful basis for contracts. For contracts with other parties, you may want to
consider legitimate interests.

When is processing ‘necessary’ for compliance?

Although the processing need not be essential for you to comply with the legal obligation, it must be a
reasonable and proportionate way of achieving compliance. You cannot rely on this lawful basis if you have
discretion over whether to process the personal data, or if there is another reasonable way to comply.

It is likely to be clear from the law in question whether the processing is actually necessary for compliance.

What else should we consider?

If you are processing on the basis of legal obligation, the individual has no right to erasure, right to data
portability, or right to object. Read our guidance on individual rights for more information.

Remember to:

@ document your decision that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation;
e identify an appropriate source for the obligation in question; and

@ include information about your purposes and lawful basis in your privacy notice.

Contract

At a glance

@ You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process someone’s personal data:
@ to deliver a contractual service to them; or
@ because they have asked you to do something before entering into a contract (eg provide a quote).
e The processing must be necessary. If you could reasonably do what they want by processing less data,
or using their data in a less intrusive way, this basis will not apply.

@ You should document your decision to rely on this lawful basis and ensure that you can justify your
reasoning.

In brief

@ When is the lawful basis for contracts likely to apply?
@ When is processing ‘necessary’ for a contract?

@ What else should we consider?

When is the lawful basis for contracts likely to apply?

You have a lawful basis for processing if:
@ you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data to comply with your
obligations under the contract.

@ you have a contract with the individual and you need to process their personal data so that they can
comply with specific counter-obligations under the contract (eg you are processing payment details).

@ you haven't yet got a contract with the individual, but they have asked you to do something as a first
step (eg provide a quote) and you need to process their personal data to do what they ask. This applies
even if they don’t actually go on to enter into a contract with you, as long as the processing was in the
context of a potential contract with that individual.

Example

An individual shopping around for car insurance requests a quotation. The insurer needs to process
certain data in order to prepare the quotation, such as the make and age of the car.

It does not apply if you need to process one person's details but the contract is with someone else.

It does not apply if you collect and reuse your customer’s data for your own business purposes, even if this
is permitted under your standard contractual terms and is part of your funding model.

530


--- New Page 92 ---
Page number: 92
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

It does not apply if you take pre-contractual steps on your own initiative, to meet other obligations, or at
the request of a third party.

Note that, in this context, a contract does not have to be a formal signed document, or even written down,
as long as there is an agreement which meets the requirements of contract law. Broadly speaking, this
means that the terms have been offered and accepted, you both intend them to be legally binding, and
there is an element of exchange (usually an exchange of goods or services for money, but this can be
anything of value). However, this is not a full explanation of contract law, and if in doubt you should seek
your own legal advice.

When is processing ‘necessary’ for a contract?

‘Necessary’ does not mean that the processing must be absolutely essential or ‘the only way’ to perform
the contract or take relevant pre-contractual steps. However, it must be more than just useful, and more
than just part of your standard terms. It must be a targeted and proportionate step which is integral to
delivering the contractual service or taking the requested action. This lawful basis does not apply if there
are other reasonable and less intrusive ways to deliver the contractual service or take the steps requested.

The processing must be necessary to perform the contract with this particular person. If the processing is
instead necessary to maintain your business model more generally, or is included in your terms for other
business purposes beyond delivering the contractual service, this lawful basis will not apply and you should
consider another lawful basis, such as legitimate interests.

Example

When a data subject makes an online purchase, a controller processes the address of the individual in
order to deliver the goods. This is necessary in order to perform the contract.

However, the profiling of an individual’s interests and preferences based on items purchased is not
necessary for the performance of the contract and the controller cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) as the
lawful basis for this processing. Even if this type of targeted advertising is a useful part of your
customer relationship and is a necessary part of your business model, it is not necessary to perform
the contract itself.

This does not mean that processing which is not necessary for the contract is automatically unlawful, but
rather that you need to look for a different lawful basis (and other safeguards such as the right to object
may come into play).

What else should we consider?

If the processing is necessary for a contract with the individual, processing is lawful on this basis and you
do not need to get separate consent.

If processing of special category data is necessary for the contract, you also need to identify a separate

@ How should we obtain, record and manage consent?

e@ In detail

Why is consent important?

The UK GDPR sets a high standard for consent, which must be unambiguous and involve a clear affirmative
action (an opt-in).

It specifically bans pre-ticked opt-in boxes. It also requires distinct (‘granular’) consent options for distinct
processing operations. Consent should be separate from other terms and conditions and should not
generally be a precondition of signing up to a service.

You must keep clear records to demonstrate consent.

The UK GDPR gives a specific right to withdraw consent. You need to tell people about their right to
withdraw, and offer them easy ways to withdraw consent at any time.

Public authorities, employers and other organisations in a position of power may find it more difficult to
show valid freely given consent.

You need to review existing consents and your consent mechanisms to check they meet the UK GDPR
standard. If they do, there is no need to obtain fresh consent.

Consent is one lawful basis for processing, and explicit consent can also legitimise use of special category
data. Consent may also be relevant where the individual has exercised their right to restriction, and explicit
consent can legitimise automated decision-making and overseas transfers of data.

Genuine consent should put individuals in control, build trust and engagement, and enhance your
reputation.

Relying on inappropriate or invalid consent could destroy trust and harm your reputation - and may leave
you open to large fines.

When is consent appropriate?

Consent is one lawful basis for processing, but there are alternatives. Consent is not inherently better or
more important than these alternatives. If consent is difficult, you should consider using an alternative.

Consent is appropriate if you can offer people real choice and control over how you use their data, and
want to build their trust and engagement. But if you cannot offer a genuine choice, consent is not
appropriate. If you would still process the personal data without consent, asking for consent is misleading
and inherently unfair.

If you make consent a precondition of a service, it is unlikely to be the most appropriate lawful basis.

Public authorities, employers and other organisations in a position of power over individuals should avoid
relying on consent unless they are confident they can demonstrate it is freely given.

What is valid consent?

535


--- New Page 97 ---
Page number: 97
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Consent must be freely given; this means giving people genuine ongoing choice and control over how you
use their data.

Consent should be obvious and require a positive action to opt in. Consent requests must be prominent,
unbundled from other terms and conditions, concise and easy to understand, and user-friendly.

Consent must specifically cover the controller’s name, the purposes of the processing and the types of
processing activity.

Explicit consent must be expressly confirmed in words, rather than by any other positive action.
There is no set time limit for consent. How long it lasts will depend on the context. You should review and

refresh consent as appropriate.

How should we obtain, record and manage consent?

Make your consent request prominent, concise, separate from other terms and conditions, and easy to
understand. Include:

e@ the name of your organisation;

@ the name of any third party controllers who will rely on the consent;
@ why you want the data;

@ what you will do with it; and

@ that individuals can withdraw consent at any time.

You must ask people to actively opt in. Don’t use pre-ticked boxes, opt-out boxes or other default settings.
Wherever possible, give separate (‘granular’) options to consent to different purposes and different types of
processing.

Keep records to evidence consent — who consented, when, how, and what they were told.

Make it easy for people to withdraw consent at any time they choose. Consider using preference-
management tools.

Keep consents under review and refresh them if anything changes. Build regular consent reviews into your
business processes.

e@ In detail

What is automated individual decision-making and profiling?

Automated individual decision-making is a decision made by automated means without any human
involvement.

Examples of this include:

® an online decision to award a loan; and

® a recruitment aptitude test which uses pre-programmed algorithms and criteria.
Automated individual decision-making does not have to involve profiling, although it often will do.

The UK GDPR says that profiling is:

541


--- New Page 103 ---
Page number: 103
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

“Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.”

[Article 4(4)]

Organisations obtain personal information about individuals from a variety of different sources. Internet
searches, buying habits, lifestyle and behaviour data gathered from mobile phones, social networks, video
surveillance systems and the Internet of Things are examples of the types of data organisations might
collect.

Information is analysed to classify people into different groups or sectors, using algorithms and machine-
learning. This analysis identifies links between different behaviours and characteristics to create profiles for

artificial intelligence, machine learning and data protection.

 

Based on the traits of others who appear similar, organisations use profiling to:

e@ find something out about individuals’ preferences;
@ predict their behaviour; and/or

@ make decisions about them.

This can be very useful for organisations and individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education,
financial services and marketing.

Automated individual decision-making and profiling can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions. But
if they are used irresponsibly there are significant risks for individuals. The UK GDPR provisions are
designed to address these risks.

What does the UK GDPR say about automated individual decision-making and profiling?

The UK GDPR restricts you from making solely automated decisions, including those based on profiling, that
have a legal or similarly significant effect on individuals.

66

“The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated
processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly
significantly affects him or her.”

[Article 22(1)]

542


--- New Page 104 ---
Page number: 104
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

For something to be solely automated there must be no human involvement in the decision-making
process.

The restriction only covers solely automated individual decision-making that produces legal or similarly
significant effects. These types of effect are not defined in the UK GDPR, but the decision must have a
serious impact on an individual to be caught by this provision.

A legal effect is something that affects someone's legal rights. Similarly significant effects are more difficult
to define but would include, for example, automatic refusal of an online credit application, and e-recruiting
practices without human intervention.

When can we carry out this type of processing?

Solely automated individual decision-making - including profiling - with legal or similarly significant effects
is restricted, although this restriction can be lifted in certain circumstances.

You can only carry out solely automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects if the
decision is:

@ necessary for entering into or performance of a contract between an organisation and the individual;
e authorised by law (for example, for the purposes of fraud or tax evasion); or

@ based on the individual’s explicit consent.

If you’re using special category personal data you can only carry out processing described in Article 22(1)
if:

@ you have the individual’s explicit consent; or

@ the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.

What else do we need to consider?

Because this type of processing is considered to be high-risk the UK GDPR requires you to carry out a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to show that you have identified and assessed what those risks are
and how you will address them.

As well as restricting the circumstances in which you can carry out solely automated individual decision-
making (as described in Article 22(1)) the UK GDPR also:

@ requires you to give individuals specific information about the processing;
e@ obliges you to take steps to prevent errors, bias and discrimination; and

@ gives individuals rights to challenge and request a review of the decision.

These provisions are designed to increase individuals’ understanding of how you might be using their
personal data.

You must:

@ provide meaningful information about the logic involved in the decision-making process, as well as the
significance and the envisaged consequences for the individual;

543


--- New Page 105 ---
Page number: 105
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures;
@ ensure that individuals can:
@ obtain human intervention;
® express their point of view; and
@ obtain an explanation of the decision and challenge it;
© put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place, so that you can correct inaccuracies and
minimise the risk of errors;

@ secure personal data in a way that is proportionate to the risk to the interests and rights of the
individual, and that prevents discriminatory effects.

What if Article 22 doesn’t apply to our processing?

Article 22 applies to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling, with legal or similarly
significant effects.

If your processing does not match this definition then you can continue to carry out profiling and
automated decision-making.

But you must still comply with the UK GDPR principles.

You must identify and record your lawful basis for the processing.

 

Individuals have a right to object to profiling in certain circumstances. You must bring details of this right
specifically to their attention.

What is the right to object?

Article 21 of the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data at
any time. This effectively allows individuals to stop or prevent you from processing their personal data.

An objection may be in relation to all of the personal data you hold about an individual or only to certain

information. It may also only relate to a particular purpose you are processing the data for.

When does the right to object apply?

The right to object only applies in certain circumstances. Whether it applies depends on your purposes for
processing and your lawful basis for processing.

Individuals have the absolute right to object to the processing of their personal data if it is for direct
marketing purposes.

Individuals can also object if the processing is for:

@ a task carried out in the public interest;
e@ the exercise of official authority vested in you; or

® your legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
In these circumstances the right to object is not absolute.

If you are processing data for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, the right to object is
more limited.

These various grounds are discussed further below.

547

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Direct marketing

An individual can object to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing at any time. This
includes any profiling of data that is related to direct marketing.

This is an absolute right and there are no exemptions or grounds for you to refuse. Therefore, when you
receive an objection to processing for direct marketing, you must not process the individual’s data for this
purpose.

However, this does not automatically mean that you need to erase the individual’s personal data, and in
most cases it will be preferable to suppress their details. Suppression involves retaining just enough
information about them to ensure that their preference not to receive direct marketing is respected in
future.

Processing based upon public task or legitimate interests

An individual can also object where you are relying on one of the following lawful bases:

@ ‘public task’ (for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest),
e ‘public task’ (for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or
e legitimate interests.

An individual must give specific reasons why they are objecting to the processing of their data. These
reasons should be based upon their particular situation.

In these circumstances this is not an absolute right, and you can refuse to comply if:

@ you can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests,
rights and freedoms of the individual; or

@ the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

If you are deciding whether you have compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests of an
individual, you should consider the reasons why they have objected to the processing of their data. In
particular, if an individual objects on the grounds that the processing is causing them substantial damage or
distress (eg the processing is causing them financial loss), the grounds for their objection will have more
weight. In making a decision on this, you need to balance the individual’s interests, rights and freedoms
with your own legitimate grounds. During this process you should remember that the responsibility is for
you to be able to demonstrate that your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

If you are satisfied that you do not need to comply with the request you should let the individual know. You
should explain your decision, and inform them of their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another
supervisory authority; and their ability to seek to enforce their rights through a judicial remedy.

Research purposes

Where you are processing personal data for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, the right
to object is more restricted.

Article 21(6) states:

548


--- New Page 110 ---
Page number: 110
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes
pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her personal situation, shall
have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.’

Effectively this means that if you are processing data for these purposes and have appropriate safeguards
in place (eg data minimisation and pseudonymisation where possible) the individual only has a right to
object if your lawful basis for processing is:

@ public task (on the basis that it is necessary for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or

e legitimate interests.

The individual does not have a right to object if your lawful basis for processing is public task because it is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in you).

This may cause difficulties if you are relying on the public task lawful basis for processing. It may not
always be clear whether you are carrying out the processing solely as a task in the public interest, or in the
exercise of official authority. Indeed, it may be difficult to differentiate between the two.

As such, it is good practice that if you are relying upon the public task lawful basis and receive an
objection, you should consider the objection on its own merits and go on to consider the steps outlined in
the next paragraph, rather than refusing it outright. If you do intend to refuse an objection on the basis
that you are carrying out research or statistical work solely for the performance of a public task carried out
in the public interest you should be clear in your privacy notice that you are only carrying out this
processing on this basis.

If you do receive an objection you may be able to continue processing, if you can demonstrate that you
have a compelling legitimate reason or the processing is necessary for legal claims. You need to go through
the steps outlined in the previous section to demonstrate this.

As noted above, if you are satisfied that you do not need to comply with the request you should let the
individual know. You should provide an explanation for your decision, and inform them of their right to

make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority, as well as their ability to seek to enforce
their rights through a judicial remedy.

Do we need to tell individuals about the right to object?

The UK GDPR is clear that you must inform individuals of their right to object at the latest at the time of
your first communication with them where:

® you process personal data for direct marketing purposes, or

e your lawful basis for processing is:

549


--- New Page 111 ---
Page number: 111
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ public task (for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest),
@ public task (for the exercise of official authority vested in you), or
e legitimate interests.

If one of these conditions applies, you should explicitly bring the right to object to the individual’s attention.
You should present this information clearly and separately from any other information.

If you are processing personal data for research or statistical purposes you should include information
about the right to object (along with information about the other rights of the individual) in your privacy
notice.

Do we always need to erase personal data to comply with an objection?

Where you have received an objection to the processing of personal data and you have no grounds to
refuse, you need to stop or not begin processing the data.

This may mean that you need to erase personal data as the definition of processing under the UK GDPR is
broad, and includes storing data. However, as noted above, this will not always be the most appropriate
action to take.

Erasure may not be appropriate if you process the data for other purposes as you need to retain the data
for those purposes. For example, when an individual objects to the processing of their data for direct
marketing, you can place their details onto a suppression list to ensure that you continue to comply with
their objection. However, you need to ensure that the data is clearly marked so that it is not processed for
purposes the individual has objected to.

Can we refuse to comply with an objection for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partly). Not all of the
exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it applies

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or

@ excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to object. For example an individual makes
a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation; or

558


--- New Page 112 ---
Page number: 112
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or

@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

551


--- New Page 113 ---
Page number: 113
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with an objection?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.
You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
e their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise an objection?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid objection. Therefore, an objection to processing can be
made verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have to be to
a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase ‘objection to processing’ or Article 21 of the UK GDPR - as
long as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal objection. However, you
have a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made an objection to you and to handle it
accordingly. Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals
may need specific training to identify an objection.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the objections you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the
objection. We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal objections.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with an objection.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

552


--- New Page 114 ---
Page number: 114
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must comply with an objection without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the
request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

® any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or
@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

553


--- New Page 115 ---
Page number: 115
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the objection you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You need to let the individual know as soon as possible that you need more information from them to
confirm their identity before responding to their objection. The period for responding to the objection
begins when you receive the additional information.

Right to data portability

At a glance

@ The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own
purposes across different services.

@ It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a
safe and secure way, without affecting its usability.

@ Doing this enables individuals to take advantage of applications and services that can use this data to
find them a better deal or help them understand their spending habits.

@ The right only applies to information an individual has provided to a controller.

@ Some organisations in the UK already offer data portability through midata and similar initiatives which
allow individuals to view, access and use their personal consumption and transaction data in a way that
is portable and safe.

What is the right to data portability?

The right to data portability gives individuals the right to receive personal data they have provided to a
controller in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format. It also gives them the right to
request that a controller transmits this data directly to another controller.

When does the right apply?

The right to data portability only applies when:

e your lawful basis for processing this information is consent or for the performance of a contract; and

® you are carrying out the processing by automated means (ie excluding paper files).

What does the right apply to?

Information is only within the scope of the right to data portability if it is personal data of the individual
that they have provided to you.

What does ‘provided to a controller’ mean?

Sometimes the personal data an individual has provided to you will be easy to identify (eg their mailing
address, username, age). However, the meaning of data ‘provided to’ you is not limited to this. It is also
personal data resulting from observation of an individual’s activities (eg where using a device or service).

This may include:

e history of website usage or search activities;
e traffic and location data; or

e ‘raw’ data processed by connected objects such as smart meters and wearable devices.

It does not include any additional data that you have created based on the data an individual has provided
to you. For example, if you use the data they have provided to create a user profile then this data would
not be in scope of data portability.

You should however note that if this ‘inferred’ or ‘derived’ data is personal data, you still need to provide it
to an individual if they make a subject access request. Bearing this in mind, if it is clear that the individual
is seeking access to the inferred/derived data, as part of a wider portability request, it would be good
practice to include this data in your response.

Does the right apply to anonymous or pseudonymous data?

The right to data portability only applies to personal data. This means that it does not apply to genuinely
anonymous data. However, pseudonymous data that can be clearly linked back to an individual (eg where
that individual provides the respective identifier) is within scope of the right.

What happens if the personal data includes information about others?

If the requested information includes information about others (eg third party data) you need to consider
whether transmitting that data would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of those third parties.

Generally speaking, providing third party data to the individual making the portability request should not be
a problem, assuming that the requestor provided this data to you within their information in the first place.
However, you should always consider whether there will be an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of
third parties, in particular when you are transmitting data directly to another controller.

If the requested data has been provided to you by multiple data subjects (eg a joint bank account) you
need to be satisfied that all parties agree to the portability request. This means that you may have to seek
agreement from all the parties involved.

What is an individual entitled to?

557

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The right to data portability entitles an individual to:

® receive a copy of their personal data; and/or

@ have their personal data transmitted from one controller to another controller.

Individuals have the right to receive their personal data and store it for further personal use. This allows
the individual to manage and reuse their personal data. For example, an individual wants to retrieve their
contact list from a webmail application to build a wedding list or to store their data in a personal data store.

You can achieve this by either:

@ directly transmitting the requested data to the individual; or

@ providing access to an automated tool that allows the individual to extract the requested data
themselves.

This does not create an obligation for you to allow individuals more general and routine access to your
systems -— only for the extraction of their data following a portability request.

You may have a preferred method of providing the information requested depending on the amount and
complexity of the data requested. In either case, you need to ensure that the method is secure.

What are the limits when transmitting personal data to another controller?

Individuals have the right to ask you to transmit their personal data directly to another controller without
hindrance. If it is technically feasible, you should do this.

You should consider the technical feasibility of a transmission on a request by request basis. The right to
data portability does not create an obligation for you to adopt or maintain processing systems which are
technically compatible with those of other organisations (UK GDPR Recital 68). However, you should take a
reasonable approach, and this should not generally create a barrier to transmission.

Without hindrance means that you should not put in place any legal, technical or financial obstacles
which slow down or prevent the transmission of the personal data to the individual, or to another
organisation.

However, there may be legitimate reasons why you cannot undertake the transmission. For example, if the
transmission would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. It is however your responsibility to
justify why these reasons are legitimate and why they are not a ‘hindrance’ to the transmission.

Do we have responsibility for the personal data we transmit to others?

If you provide information directly to an individual or to another organisation in response to a data
portability request, you are not responsible for any subsequent processing carried out by the individual or
the other organisation. However, you are responsible for the transmission of the data and need to take
appropriate measures to ensure that it is transmitted securely and to the right destination.

If you provide data to an individual, it is possible that they will store the information in a system with less
security than your own. Therefore, you should make individuals aware of this so that they can take steps to
protect the information they have received.

558

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You also need to ensure that you comply with the other provisions in the UK GDPR. For example, whilst
there is no specific obligation under the right to data portability to check and verify the quality of the data
you transmit, you should already have taken reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of this data in order
to comply with the requirements of the accuracy principle of the UK GDPR.

How should we provide the data?

You should provide the personal data in a format that is:

e@ structured;
® commonly used; and

@ machine-readable.

Although these terms are not defined in the UK GDPR these three characteristics can help you decide
whether the format you intend to use is appropriate.

You can also find relevant information in the ‘Open Data Handbook’, published by Open Knowledge
International. The handbook is a guide to ‘open data’, information that is free to access and can be re-used
for any purpose - particularly information held by the public sector. The handbook contains a number of
definitions that are relevant to the right to data portability, and this guidance includes some of these below.

What does ‘structured’ mean?

Structured data allows for easier transfer and increased usability.

The Open Data Handbook defines ‘structured data’ as:

66

‘data where the structural relation between elements is explicit in the way the data is stored ona
computer disk.’

This means that software must be able to extract specific elements of the data. An example of a structured
format is a spreadsheet, where the data is organised into rows and columns, ie it is ‘structured’. In practice,
some of the personal data you process will already be in structured form.

In many cases, if a format is structured it is also machine-readable.

What does ‘commonly used’ mean?

This simply means that the format you choose must be widely-used and well-established.

However, just because a format is ‘commonly used’ does not mean it is appropriate for data portability. You
have to consider whether it is ‘structured’, and ‘machine-readable’ as well. Although you may be using
common software applications, which save data in commonly-used formats, these may not be sufficient to
meet the requirements of data portability.

559


--- New Page 121 ---
Page number: 121
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What does ‘machine-readable’ mean?

The Open Data Handbook states that ‘machine readable’ data is:

66

‘Data in a data format that can be automatically read and processed by a computer.’

Furthermore, Regulation 2 of the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 defines ‘machine-
readable format’ as:

66

‘A file format structured so that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific
data, including individual statements of fact, and their internal structure.’

Machine-readable data can be made directly available to applications that request that data over the web.
This is undertaken by means of an application programming interface (“API”).

If you are able to implement such a system then you can facilitate data exchanges with individuals and
respond to data portability requests in an easy manner.

Should we use an ‘interoperable’ format?

Although you are not required to use an interoperable format, this is encouraged by the UK GDPR, which
seeks to promote the concept of interoperability. Recital 68 says:

66

‘Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability.’

Interoperability allows different systems to share information and resources. An ‘interoperable format’ is a
type of format that allows data to be exchanged between different systems and be understandable to both.

At the same time, you are not expected to maintain systems that are technically compatible with those of
other organisations. Data portability is intended to produce interoperable systems, not compatible ones.

What formats can we use?

You may already be using an appropriate format within your networks and systems, and/or you may be
required to use a particular format due to the particular industry or sector you are part of. Provided it
meets the requirements of being structured, commonly-used and machine readable then it could be
appropriate for a data portability request.

568

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The UK GDPR does not require you to use open formats internally. Your processing systems may indeed use
proprietary formats which individuals may not be able to access if you provide data to them in these
formats. In these cases you need to perform some additional processing on the personal data in order to
put it into the type of format required by the UK GDPR.

Where no specific format is in common use within your industry or sector, you should provide personal data
using open formats such as CSV, XML and JSON. You may also find that these formats are the easiest for
you to use when answering data portability requests.

For further information on CSV, XML and JSON, please see below.

What is CSV?

CSV stands for ‘Comma Separated Values’. It is defined by the Open Data Handbook as:

66

‘a standard format for spreadsheet data. Data is represented in a plain text file, with each data row on
a new line and commas separating the values on each row. As a very simple open format it is easy to
consume and is widely used for publishing open data.’

CSV is used to exchange data and is widely supported by software applications. Although CSV is not
standardised it is nevertheless structured, commonly used and machine-readable and is therefore an
appropriate format for you to use when responding to a data portability request.

What is XML?

XML stands for ‘Extensible Markup Language’. It is defined by the Open Data Handbook as:

66

‘a simple and powerful standard for representing structured data.’

It is a file format that is intended to be both human readable and machine-readable. Unlike CSV, XML is
defined by a set of open standards maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C’”). It is widely
used for documents, but can also be used to represent data structures such as those used in web services.

This means XML can be processed by APIs, facilitating data exchange. For example, you may develop or
implement an API to exchange personal data in XML format with another organisation. In the context of
data portability, this can allow you to transmit personal data to an individual’s personal data store, or to
another organisation if the individual has asked you to do so.

What is JSON?

JSON stands for ‘JavaScript Object Notation’. The Open Data Handbook defines JSON as:

561


--- New Page 123 ---
Page number: 123
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘a simple but powerful format for data. It can describe complex data structures, is highly machine-
readable as well as reasonably human-readable, and is independent of platform and programming
language, and is therefore a popular format for data interchange between programs and systems.’

It is a file format based on the JavaScript language that many web sites use and is used as a data
interchange format. As with XML, it can be read by humans or machines. It is also a standardised open
format maintained by the W3C.

Are these the only formats we can use?

CSV, XML and JSON are three examples of structured, commonly used and machine-readable formats that
are appropriate for data portability. However, this does not mean you are obliged to use them. Other
formats exist that also meet the requirements of data portability.

Example

The RDF or ‘Resource Description Framework’ format is also a structured, commonly-used, machine-
readable format. It is an open standard published by the W3C and is intended to provide
interoperability between applications exchanging information.

You should however consider the nature of the portability request. If the individual cannot make use of the
format, even if it is structured, commonly-used and machine-readable then the data will be of no use to
them.

What responsibilities do we have when we receive personal data because of a data portability
request?

When you receive personal data that has been transmitted as part of a data portability request, you need
to process this data in line with data protection requirements.

In deciding whether to accept and retain personal data, you should consider whether the data is relevant
and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which you will process it. You also need to consider
whether the data contains any third party information.

As anew controller, you need to ensure that you have an appropriate lawful basis for processing any third
party data and that this processing does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of those third parties.
If you have received personal data which you have no reason to keep, you should delete it as soon as
possible. When you accept and retain data, it becomes your responsibility to ensure that you comply with
the requirements of the UK GDPR.

In particular, if you receive third party data you should not use this for your own purposes. You should keep
the third party data under the sole control of the individual who has made the portability request, and only
used for their own purposes.

563

Example

An individual enters into a contract with a controller for the provision of a service. The controller relies
on Article 6(1)(b) to process the individual’s personal data. The controller receives information from a
data portability request that includes information about third parties. The controller has a legitimate
interest to process the third party data under Article 6(1)(f) so that it can provide this service to the
individual. However, it should not then use this data to send direct marketing to the third parties.

When can we refuse to comply with a request for data portability?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for data portability (wholly or partly). Not
all of the exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or
® excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to data portability. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

564


--- New Page 126 ---
Page number: 126
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for data portability?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the
request.

You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and

@ their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

565


--- New Page 127 ---
Page number: 127
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how individuals should make data portability requests. Therefore, requests
could be made verbally or in writing. They can also be made to any part of your organisation and do not
have to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase 'request for data portability’ or a reference to ‘Article 20 of
the UK GDPR’, as long as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid request. However, you have a
legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need
specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

In practice, you may already have processes in place to enable your staff to recognise subject access
requests, such as training or established procedures. You could consider adapting them to ensure your staff
also recognise data portability requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for data portability.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

You must comply with a request for data portability without undue delay and at the latest within one month
of receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

@ any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month

566


--- New Page 128 ---
Page number: 128
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You need to let the individual know as soon as possible that you need more information from them to
confirm their identity before responding to their request. The period for responding to the request begins
when you receive the additional information.

What is the right to restrict processing?

Article 18 of the UK GDPR gives individuals the right to restrict the processing of their personal data in
certain circumstances. This means that an individual can limit the way that an organisation uses their data.
This is an alternative to requesting the erasure of their data.

Individuals have the right to restrict the processing of their personal data where they have a particular
reason for wanting the restriction. This may be because they have issues with the content of the
information you hold or how you have processed their data. In most cases you will not be required to
restrict an individual’s personal data indefinitely, but will need to have the restriction in place for a certain
period of time.

When does the right to restrict processing apply?

Individuals have the right to request you restrict the processing of their personal data in the following
circumstances:

@ the individual contests the accuracy of their personal data and you are verifying the accuracy of the
data;

e@ the data has been unlawfully processed (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the first principle
of the UK GDPR) and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead;

@ you no longer need the personal data but the individual needs you to keep it in order to establish,
exercise or defend a legal claim; or

@ the individual has objected to you processing their data under Article 21(1), and you are considering
whether your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

Although this is distinct from the right to rectification and the right to object, there are close links between

5708


--- New Page 132 ---
Page number: 132
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

those rights and the right to restrict processing:
e if an individual has challenged the accuracy of their data and asked for you to rectify it (Article 16), they
also have a right to request you restrict processing while you consider their rectification request; or
e if an individual exercises their right to object under Article 21(1), they also have a right to request you

restrict processing while you consider their objection request.

Therefore, as a matter of good practice you should automatically restrict the processing whilst you are
considering its accuracy or the legitimate grounds for processing the personal data in question.

How do we restrict processing?

You need to have processes in place that enable you to restrict personal data if required. It is important to
note that the definition of processing includes a broad range of operations including collection, structuring,
dissemination and erasure of data. Therefore, you should use methods of restriction that are appropriate
for the type of processing you are carrying out.

The UK GDPR suggests a number of different methods that could be used to restrict data, such as:

@ temporarily moving the data to another processing system;

@ making the data unavailable to users; or

@ temporarily removing published data from a website.

It is particularly important that you consider how you store personal data that you no longer need to

process but the individual has requested you restrict (effectively requesting that you do not erase the
data).

If you are using an automated filing system, you need to use technical measures to ensure that any further
processing cannot take place and that the data cannot be changed whilst the restriction is in place. You
should also note on your system that the processing of this data has been restricted.

Can we do anything with restricted data?

You must not process the restricted data in any way except to store it unless:

@ you have the individual’s consent;
e it is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
e it is for the protection of the rights of another person (natural or legal); or

e it is for reasons of important public interest.

Do we have to tell other organisations about the restriction of personal data?

Yes. If you have disclosed the personal data in question to others, you must contact each recipient and
inform them of the restriction of the personal data - unless this proves impossible or involves
disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individual about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,

571


--- New Page 133 ---
Page number: 133
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

When can we lift the restriction?

In many cases the restriction of processing is only temporary, specifically when the restriction is on the
grounds that:
@ the individual has disputed the accuracy of the personal data and you are investigating this; or

e@ the individual has objected to you processing their data on the basis that it is necessary for the
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the purposes of your legitimate interests, and
you are considering whether your legitimate grounds override those of the individual.

Once you have made a decision on the accuracy of the data, or whether your legitimate grounds override
those of the individual, you may decide to lift the restriction.

If you do this, you must inform the individual before you lift the restriction.

As noted above, these two conditions are linked to the right to rectification (Article 16) and the right to
object (Article 21). This means that if you are informing the individual that you are lifting the restriction (on
the grounds that you are satisfied that the data is accurate, or that your legitimate grounds override theirs)
you should also inform them of the reasons for your refusal to act upon their rights under Articles 16 or 21.
You will also need to inform them of their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory
authority; and their ability to seek a judicial remedy.

Can we refuse to comply with a request for restriction?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for restriction (wholly or partly). Not all of
the exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:
e manifestly unfounded; or
° excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or

excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to restriction. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other

572

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
e the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

573


--- New Page 135 ---
Page number: 135
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for restriction?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.
You should inform the individual about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
@ their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How do we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request
for restriction verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have
to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request does not have to include the phrase 'request for restriction’ or Article 18 of the UK GDPR, as long
as one of the conditions listed above apply.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal request. However, you have
a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need
specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for restriction.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

574


--- New Page 136 ---
Page number: 136
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must comply with a request for restriction without undue delay and at the latest within one month of
receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

® any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

@ a fee (only in certain circumstances —- see Can we charge a fee?)

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and

575


--- New Page 137 ---
Page number: 137
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

what you are using it for.

You must let the individual know without undue delay and within one month that you need more
information from them to confirm their identity. You do not need to comply with the request until you have
received the additional information.

What is the right to erasure?

Under Article 17 of the UK GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased. This is also known
as the ‘right to be forgotten’.

The right only applies to data held at the time the request is received. It does not apply to data that may
be created in the future. The right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.

When does the right to erasure apply?

Individuals have the right to have their personal data erased if:
e@ the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which you originally collected or processed it
for;

® you are relying on consent as your lawful basis for holding the data, and the individual withdraws their
consent;

® you are relying on legitimate interests as your basis for processing, the individual objects to the
processing of their data, and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing;

® you are processing the personal data for direct marketing purposes and the individual objects to that
processing;

@ you have processed the personal data unlawfully (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the 1st
principle);

@ you have to do it to comply with a legal obligation; or

@ you have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.

How does the right to erasure apply to data collected from children?

There is an emphasis on the right to have personal data erased if the request relates to data collected from
children. This reflects the enhanced protection of children’s information, especially in online environments,

578


--- New Page 140 ---
Page number: 140
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

under the UK GDPR.

Therefore, if you process data collected from children, you should give particular weight to any request for
erasure if the processing of the data is based upon consent given by a child —- especially any processing of

their personal data on the internet. This is still the case when the data subject is no longer a child, because
a child may not have been fully aware of the risks involved in the processing at the time of consent.

For further details about the right to erasure and children’s personal data please read our guidance on

Do we have to tell other organisations about the erasure of personal data?

The UK GDPR specifies two circumstances where you should tell other organisations about the erasure of
personal data:

@ the personal data has been disclosed to others; or

@ the personal data has been made public in an online environment (for example on social networks,
forums or websites).

If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the
erasure, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform
the individuals about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,
under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

Where personal data has been made public in an online environment reasonable steps should be taken to
inform other controllers who are processing the personal data to erase links to, copies or replication of that
data. When deciding what steps are reasonable you should take into account available technology and the
cost of implementation.

Do we have to erase personal data from backup systems?

If a valid erasure request is received and no exemption applies then you will have to take steps to ensure
erasure from backup systems as well as live systems. Those steps will depend on your particular
circumstances, your retention schedule (particularly in the context of its backups), and the technical
mechanisms that are available to you.

You must be absolutely clear with individuals as to what will happen to their data when their erasure
request is fulfilled, including in respect of backup systems.

It may be that the erasure request can be instantly fulfilled in respect of live systems, but that the data will
remain within the backup environment for a certain period of time until it is overwritten.

The key issue is to put the backup data ‘beyond use’, even if it cannot be immediately overwritten. You
must ensure that you do not use the data within the backup for any other purpose, ie that the backup is
simply held on your systems until it is replaced in line with an established schedule. Provided this is the
case it may be unlikely that the retention of personal data within the backup would pose a significant risk,

579


--- New Page 141 ---
Page number: 141
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

although this will be context specific. For more information on what we mean by ‘putting data beyond use’

When does the right to erasure not apply?

The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:

@ to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
@ to comply with a legal obligation;
e for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;

e for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical purposes
where erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or

e for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If you are required by law to process individuals’ personal data, then the right to erasure will not apply.

The UK GDPR also specifies two circumstances where the right to erasure will not apply to special category
data:

e if the processing is necessary for public health purposes in the public interest (eg protecting against
serious cross-border threats to health, or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care
and of medicinal products or medical devices); or

e if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine; for the working
capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care; or for the
management of health or social care systems or services. This only applies where the data is being
processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to a legal obligation of professional
secrecy (eg a health professional).

Example

An individual who previously worked for an organisation and has now left asks their old employer to
erase all their personal data.

The organisation needs to process personal data to comply with its legal obligation to disclose
employee salary details to HMRC.

The organisation can refuse the request to erase the individual’s data, as they remain under a legal
obligation to process it.

Example
A healthcare provider receives a request from a previous patient to erase all of their personal data.

However, the provider’s liability insurance requires them to retain patient records in case of complaints
or legal claims.

The organisation can refuse the request to erase the individual’s data, as they are processing the data
for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Can we refuse to comply with a request for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with a request for erasure (wholly or partly). Not all of

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

What is the right to rectification?

Under Article 16 of the UK GDPR individuals have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified. An
individual may also be able to have incomplete personal data completed - although this will depend on the
purposes for the processing. This may involve providing a supplementary statement to the incomplete data.

This right has close links to the accuracy principle of the UK GDPR (Article 5(1)(d)). However, although you
may have already taken steps to ensure that the personal data was accurate when you obtained it, this
right imposes a specific obligation to reconsider the accuracy upon request.

What do we need to do?

If you receive a request for rectification you should take reasonable steps to satisfy yourself that the data is
accurate and to rectify the data if necessary. You should take into account the arguments and evidence
provided by the data subject.

What steps are reasonable will depend, in particular, on the nature of the personal data and what it will be
used for. The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort you should put
into checking its accuracy and, if necessary, taking steps to rectify it. For example, you should make a
greater effort to rectify inaccurate personal data if it is used to make significant decisions that will affect an
individual or others, rather than trivial ones.

You may also take into account any steps you have already taken to verify the accuracy of the data prior to
the challenge by the data subject.

When is data inaccurate?

The UK GDPR does not give a definition of the term accuracy. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA
2018) states that personal data is inaccurate if it is incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.

587


--- New Page 149 ---
Page number: 149
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What should we do about data that records a mistake?

Determining whether personal data is inaccurate can be more complex if the data refers to a mistake that
has subsequently been resolved. It may be possible to argue that the record of the mistake is, in itself,
accurate and should be kept. In such circumstances the fact that a mistake was made and the correct
information should also be included in the individuals data.

Example

If a patient is diagnosed by a GP as suffering from a particular illness or condition, but it is later proved
that this is not the case, it is likely that their medical records should record both the initial diagnosis
(even though it was later proved to be incorrect) and the final findings. Whilst the medical record
shows a misdiagnosis, it is an accurate record of the patient's medical treatment. As long as the
medical record contains the up-to-date findings, and this is made clear in the record, it would be
difficult to argue that the record is inaccurate and should be rectified.

What should we do about data that records a disputed opinion?

It is also complex if the data in question records an opinion. Opinions are, by their very nature, subjective,
and it can be difficult to conclude that the record of an opinion is inaccurate. As long as the record shows
clearly that the information is an opinion and, where appropriate, whose opinion it is, it may be difficult to
say that it is inaccurate and needs to be rectified.

What should we do while we are considering the accuracy?

Under Article 18 an individual has the right to request restriction of the processing of their personal data
where they contest its accuracy and you are checking it. As a matter of good practice, you should restrict
the processing of the personal data in question whilst you are verifying its accuracy, whether or not the
individual has exercised their right to restriction. For more information, see our guidance on the right to
restriction.

 

What should we do if we are satisfied that the data is accurate?

You should let the individual know if you are satisfied that the personal data is accurate, and tell them that
you will not be amending the data. You should explain your decision, and inform them of their right to
make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and their ability to seek to enforce their
rights through a judicial remedy.

It is also good practice to place a note on your system indicating that the individual challenges the accuracy
of the data and their reasons for doing so.

Can we refuse to comply with the request for rectification for other reasons?

If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partly). Not all of the

588


--- New Page 150 ---

exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it applies

You can also refuse to comply with a request if it is:

@ manifestly unfounded; or
® excessive.

In order to decide if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive you must consider each request on a
case-by-case basis. You should not have a blanket policy.

You must be able to demonstrate to the individual why you consider the request is manifestly unfounded or
excessive and, if asked, explain your reasons to the Information Commissioner.

What does manifestly unfounded mean?

A request may be manifestly unfounded if:

@ the individual clearly has no intention to exercise their right to rectification. For example an individual
makes a request, but then offers to withdraw it in return for some form of benefit from the organisation;
or

e@ the request is malicious in intent and is being used to harass an organisation with no real purposes other
than to cause disruption. For example:

@ the individual has explicitly stated, in the request itself or in other communications, that they intend
to cause disruption;

e@ the request makes unsubstantiated accusations against you or specific employees;
@ the individual is targeting a particular employee against whom they have some personal grudge; or
@ the individual systematically sends different requests to you as part of a campaign, eg once a week,

with the intention of causing disruption.

This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must
consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is
manifestly unfounded.

Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously
submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or
abusive language.

The inclusion of the word “manifestly” means there must be an obvious or clear quality to it being
unfounded. You should consider the specific situation and whether the individual genuinely wants to
exercise their rights. If this is the case, it is unlikely that the request will be manifestly unfounded.

Example

An individual believes that information held about them is inaccurate. They repeatedly request its
correction but you have previously investigated and told them you regard it as accurate.

589

Page number: 151
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The individual continues to make requests along with unsubstantiated claims against you as the
controller.

You refuse the most recent request because it is manifestly unfounded and you notify the individual of
this.

What does excessive mean?

A request may be excessive if:

e it repeats the substance of previous requests; or
@ it overlaps with other requests.

However, it depends on the particular circumstances. It will not necessarily be excessive just because the
individual:

@ makes a request about the same issue. An individual may have legitimate reasons for making requests
that repeat the content of previous requests. For example, if the controller has not handled previous
requests properly;

@ makes an overlapping request, if it relates to a completely separate set of information; or

@ previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive.

What should we do if we refuse to comply with a request for rectification?

You must inform the individual without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request about:

e@ the reasons you are not taking action;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and
e their ability to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.

You should also provide this information if you request a reasonable fee or need additional information to
identify the individual.

How can we recognise a request?

The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request
for rectification verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not
have to be to a specific person or contact point.

A request to rectify personal data does not need to mention the phrase ‘request for rectification’ or Article
16 of the UK GDPR to be a valid request. As long as the individual has challenged the accuracy of their data
and has asked you to correct it, or has asked that you take steps to complete data held about them that is
incomplete, this will be a valid request under Article 16.

This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal request. However, you have
a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly.
Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need

598


--- New Page 152 ---
Page number: 152
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

specific training to identify a request.

Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive,
particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have
understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request.
We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.

Can we charge a fee?

In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a request for rectification.

However, you can charge a “reasonable fee” for the administrative costs of complying with the request if it
is manifestly unfounded or excessive. You should base the reasonable fee on the administrative costs of
complying with the request.

If you decide to charge a fee you should contact the individual promptly and inform them. You do not need
to comply with the request until you have received the fee.

Alternatively, you can refuse to comply with a manifestly unfounded or excessive request.

How long do we have to comply?

You must comply with a request for rectification without undue delay and at the latest within one month of
receipt of the request or (if later) within one month of receipt of:

e any information requested to confirm the requester’s identity (see Can we ask an individual for ID?); or

 

You should calculate the time limit from the day you receive the request (whether it is a working day or
not) until the corresponding calendar date in the next month.

Example

An organisation receives a request on 3 September. The time limit will start from the same day. This
gives the organisation until 3 October to comply with the request.

If this is not possible because the following month is shorter (and there is no corresponding calendar date),
the date for response is the last day of the following month.

If the corresponding date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, you have until the next working day to
respond.

This means that the exact number of days you have to comply with a request varies, depending on the
month in which the request was made.

591


--- New Page 153 ---
Page number: 153
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

An organisation receives a request on 31 March. The time limit starts from the same day. As there is no
equivalent date in April, the organisation has until 30 April to comply with the request.

If 30 April falls on a weekend, or is a public holiday, the organisation has until the end of the next
working day to comply.

For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it
may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.

Can we extend the time for a response?

You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received
a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving
their request and explain why the extension is necessary.

Can we ask an individual for ID?

If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information.
However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The
key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and
what you are using it for.

You must let the individual know without undue delay and within one month that you need more
information from them to confirm their identity. You do not need to comply with the request until you have
received the additional information.

Do we have to tell other organisations if we rectify personal data?

If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the
rectification or completion of the personal data - unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate
effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individual about these recipients.

The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to
which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who,
under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.

595


--- New Page 157 ---
Page number: 157
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The right of access, commonly referred to as subject access, gives individuals the right to obtain a copy of
their personal data, as well as other supplementary information. It helps individuals to understand how and
why you are using their data, and check you are doing it lawfully.

How do we recognise a subject access request (SAR)?

An individual can make a SAR verbally or in writing, including on social media. A request is valid if it is clear
that the individual is asking for their own personal data. An individual does not need to use a specific form
of words, refer to legislation or direct the request to a specific contact.

An individual may ask a third party (eg a relative, friend or solicitor) to make a SAR on their behalf. You
may also receive a SAR made on behalf of an individual through an online portal. Before responding, you
need to be satisfied that the third party making the request is entitled to act on behalf of the individual. It
is the third party’s responsibility to provide evidence of their authority.

What about requests for information about children?

Before responding to a SAR for information held about a child, you should consider whether the child is
mature enough to understand their rights. If the request is from a child and you are confident they can
understand their rights, you should usually respond directly to the child. You may, however, allow the
parent or guardian to exercise the child’s rights on their behalf if the child authorises this, or if it is evident
that this is in the best interests of the child. If a child is competent, they may authorise someone else,
other than a parent or guardian, to make a SAR on their behalf.

What should we consider when responding to a request?

You must comply with a SAR without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receiving the
request. You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have
received a number of requests from the individual, eg other types of requests relating to individuals’ rights.

If you process a large amount of information about an individual, you may be able to ask them to specify
the information or processing activities their request relates to, if it is not clear. The time limit for
responding to the request is paused until you receive clarification, although you should supply any of the
supplementary information you can do within one month.

Can we ask for ID?

Yes. You need to be satisfied that you know the identity of the requester (or the person the request is made
on behalf of). If you are unsure, you can ask for information to verify an individual’s identity. The timescale
for responding to a SAR does not begin until you have received the requested information. However, you
should request ID documents promptly.

Can we charge a fee?

Not usually. In most cases you cannot charge a fee to comply with a SAR. However, you can charge a
‘reasonable fee’ for the administrative costs of complying with a request if it is manifestly unfounded or
excessive, or if an individual requests further copies of their data.

596


--- New Page 158 ---
Page number: 158
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

How do we find and retrieve the relevant information?

You should make reasonable efforts to find and retrieve the requested information. However, you are not
required to conduct searches that would be unreasonable or disproportionate to the importance of
providing access to the information.

How should we supply information to the requester?

An individual is entitled to a copy of their personal data and to other supplementary information (which
largely corresponds with the information that you should provide in a privacy notice). If an individual makes
a request electronically, you should provide the information in a commonly used electronic format, unless
the individual requests otherwise.

When deciding what format to use, you should consider both the circumstances of the particular request
and whether the individual has the ability to access the data you provide in that format. It is good practice
to establish the individual’s preferred format prior to fulfilling their request. Alternatives can also include
allowing the individual to access their data remotely and download a copy in an appropriate format.

If an individual asks, you can provide a verbal response to their SAR, provided that you have confirmed
their identity by other means. You should keep a record of the date they made the request, the date you
responded, details of who provided the information and what information you provided.

As the controller of the information you are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure its
security. Please see our detailed guidance ‘How do we provide the information securely?’ for more
information.

 

When can we refuse to comply with a request?

Where an exemption applies, you may refuse to provide all or some of the requested information,
depending on the circumstances. You can also refuse to comply with a SAR if it is manifestly unfounded or

whether a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
If you refuse to comply with a request, you must inform the individual of:

e@ the reasons why;
e their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and

e their ability to seek to enforce this right through the courts.

What should we do if the request involves information about other individuals?

Where possible, you should consider whether it is possible to comply with the request without disclosing
information that identifies another individual. If this is not possible, you do not have to comply with the
request except where the other individual consents to the disclosure or it is reasonable to comply with the
request without that individual’s consent.

Our detailed guidance provides further information on what you need to consider in these circumstances.

You need to respond to the requester whether or not you decide to disclose information about a third party.

597


--- New Page 159 ---
Page number: 159
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You must be able to justify your decision to disclose or withhold information about a third party, so you
should keep a record of what you decide and why.

What other exemptions are there?

The exemptions are set out in Schedules 2 and 3 of the DPA 2018 and they are as follows:

@ Crime and taxation: general

@ Crime and taxation: risk assessment

@ Legal professional privilege

e@ Functions designed to protect the public

@ Regulatory functions relating to legal services, the health service and children’s services
e Other regulatory functions

e@ Judicial appointments, independence and proceedings
e@ Journalism, academia, art and literature

@ Research and statistics

@ Archiving in the public interest

@ Health, education and social work data

@ Child abuse data

@ Management information

e@ Negotiations with the requester

© Confidential references

e Exam scripts and exam marks

@ Other exemptions

above are those most likely to apply in practice, the DPA 2018 contains additional exemptions that may be
relevant when dealing with a SAR. For more information, please see our guidance about exemptions.

 

Are there any special cases?

Yes. There are special rules and provisions about SARs and some categories of personal data, including:

® unstructured manual records;
® credit files;

@ health data;

@ educational data; and

e@ social work data.

Can the right of access be enforced?

598


--- New Page 160 ---
Page number: 160
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Yes. In appropriate cases, the ICO may take action against a controller or processor if they fail to comply
with data protection legislation. The ICO will exercise these enforcement powers in accordance with our
Regulatory Action Policy.

If you fail to comply with a SAR, the requester may apply for a court order requiring you to comply or to
seek compensation. It is a matter for the court to decide, in each particular case, what action to take.

Can we force an individual to make a SAR?

No. An enforced SAR is when someone requires an individual to make a SAR to gain access to certain
information about them (eg their convictions, cautions or health records). This information is then used, for
example, as supporting evidence regarding a job application or before entering into a contract for
insurance. Forcing an individual to make a SAR in such circumstances is a criminal offence.

What is the right to be informed and why is it important?

The right to be informed covers some of the key transparency requirements of the UK GDPR. It is about
providing individuals with clear and concise information about what you do with their personal data.

Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR specify what individuals have the right to be informed about. We call this
‘privacy information’.

Using an effective approach can help you to comply with other aspects of the UK GDPR, foster trust with
individuals and obtain more useful information from them.

Getting this wrong can leave you open to fines and lead to reputational damage.

What privacy information should we provide?

The table below summarises the information that you must provide. What you need to tell people differs
slightly depending on whether you collect personal data from the individual it relates to or obtain it from
another source.

When should we provide privacy information?

When you collect personal data from the individual it relates to, you must provide them with privacy
information at the time you obtain their data.

When you obtain personal data from a source other than the individual it relates to, you need to provide
the individual with privacy information:
e@ within a reasonable period of obtaining the personal data and no later than one month;

e if you use the data to communicate with the individual, at the latest, when the first communication
takes place; or

e if you envisage disclosure to someone else, at the latest, when you disclose the data.
You must actively provide privacy information to individuals. You can meet this requirement by putting the

information on your website, but you must make individuals aware of it and give them an easy way to
access it.

Are there any exceptions?

When collecting personal data from individuals, you do not need to provide them with any information that
they already have.

When obtaining personal data from other sources, you do not need to provide individuals with privacy
information if:

@ the individual already has the information;

® providing the information to the individual would be impossible;

®@ providing the information to the individual would involve a disproportionate effort;

@ providing the information to the individual would render impossible or seriously impair the achievement
of the objectives of the processing;

® you are required by law to obtain or disclose the personal data; or

® you are subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by law that covers the personal data.

How should we draft our privacy information?

604


--- New Page 166 ---
Page number: 166
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

An information audit or data mapping exercise can help you find out what personal data you hold and what
you do with it.

You should think about the intended audience for your privacy information and put yourself in their
position.

If you collect or obtain children’s personal data, you must take particular care to ensure that the
information you provide them with is appropriately written, using clear and plain language.

For all audiences, you must provide information to them in a way that is:

® concise;

@ transparent;

@ intelligible;

e@ easily accessible; and

® uses clear and plain language.

It is good practice to carry out user testing on your draft privacy information to get feedback on how easy it
is to access and understand.

After it is finalised, undertake regular reviews to check it remains accurate and up to date.

If you plan to use personal data for any new purposes, you must update your privacy information and
proactively bring any changes to people’s attention.

What methods can we use to provide privacy information?

There are a number of techniques you can use to provide people with privacy information. You can use:
e A layered approach - short notices containing key privacy information that have additional layers of
more detailed information.

e Dashboards - preference management tools that inform people how you use their data and allow them
to manage what happens with it.

e Just-in-time notices — relevant and focused privacy information delivered at the time you collect
individual pieces of information about people.

@ Icons - small, meaningful, symbols that indicate the existence of a particular type of data processing.

@ Mobile and smart device functionalities — including pop-ups, voice alerts and mobile device
gestures.

Consider the context in which you are collecting personal data. It is good practice to use the same medium
you use to collect personal data to deliver privacy information.

Taking a blended approach, using more than one of these techniques, is often the most effective way to
provide privacy information.

What common issues might come up in practice?

If you share personal data with (or sell it to) other organisations:

605


--- New Page 167 ---
Page number: 167
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ As part of the privacy information you provide, you must tell people who you are giving their information
to, unless you are relying on an exception or an exemption.

® You can tell people the names of the organisations or the categories that they fall within; choose the
option that is most meaningful.

@ It is good practice to use a dashboard to let people manage who their data is sold to, or shared with,
where they have a choice.

If you buy personal data from other organisations:
e@ You must provide people with your own privacy information, unless you are relying on an exception or
an exemption.

e If you think that it is impossible to provide privacy information to individuals, or it would involve a
disproportionate effort, you must carry out a DPIA to find ways to mitigate the risks of the processing.

e If your purpose for using the personal data is different to that for which it was originally obtained, you
must tell people about this, as well as what your lawful basis is for the processing.

e@ Provide people with your privacy information within a reasonable period of buying the data, and no later

If you obtain personal data from publicly accessible sources:
@ You still have to provide people with privacy information, unless you are relying on an exception or an
exemption.

e If you think that it is impossible to provide privacy information to individuals, or it would involve a
disproportionate effort, you must carry out a DPIA to find ways to mitigate the risks of the processing.

@ Be very clear with individuals about any unexpected or intrusive uses of personal data, such as
combining information about them from a number of different sources.

@ Provide people with privacy information within a reasonable period of obtaining the data, and no later
than one month.

If you apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) to personal data:

@ Be upfront about it and explain your purposes for using AI.

e If the purposes for processing are unclear at the outset, give people an indication of what you are going
to do with their data. As your processing purposes become clearer, update your privacy information and
actively communicate this to people.

e Inform people about any new uses of personal data before you actually start the processing.

e@ If you use AI to make solely automated decisions about people with legal or similarly significant effects,
tell them what information you use, why it is relevant and what the likely impact is going to be.

@ Consider using just-in-time notices and dashboards which can help to keep people informed and let
them control further uses of their personal data.

Accountability and governance

At a glance

@ Accountability is one of the data protection principles - it makes you responsible for complying with the
UK GDPR and says that you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.

@ You need to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to meet the requirements of
accountability.

e There are a number of measures that you can, and in some cases must, take including:
@ adopting and implementing data protection policies;
@ taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach;
@ putting written contracts in place with organisations that process personal data on your behalf;
@ maintaining documentation of your processing activities;
@ implementing appropriate security measures;
@ recording and, where necessary, reporting personal data breaches;

® carrying out data protection impact assessments for uses of personal data that are likely to result in
high risk to individuals’ interests;

® appointing a data protection officer; and

@ adhering to relevant codes of conduct and signing up to certification schemes.

@ Accountability obligations are ongoing. You must review and, where necessary, update the measures you
put in place.

e If you implement a privacy management framework this can help you embed your accountability
measures and create a culture of privacy across your organisation.

e@ Being accountable can help you to build trust with individuals and may help you mitigate enforcement
action.

What is accountability?

There are two key elements. First, the accountability principle makes it clear that you are responsible for
complying with the GDPR. Second, you must be able to demonstrate your compliance.

Why is accountability important?

Taking responsibility for what you do with personal data, and demonstrating the steps you have taken to
protect people’s rights not only results in better legal compliance, it also offers you a competitive edge.
Accountability is a real opportunity for you to show, and prove, how you respect people’s privacy. This can
help you to develop and sustain people’s trust.

Furthermore, if something does go wrong, then being able to show that you actively considered the risks
and put in place measures and safeguards can help you provide mitigation against any potential
enforcement action. On the other hand, if you can’t show good data protection practices, it may leave you
open to fines and reputational damage.

What do we need to do?

Accountability is not a box-ticking exercise. Being responsible for compliance with the UK GDPR means
that you need to be proactive and organised about your approach to data protection, while demonstrating
your compliance means that you must be able to evidence the steps you take to comply.

To achieve this, if you are a larger organisation you may choose to put in place a privacy management
framework. This can help you create a culture of commitment to data protection, by embedding systematic
and demonstrable compliance across your organisation. Amongst other things, your framework should
include:

618


--- New Page 172 ---
Page number: 172
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ robust program controls informed by the requirements of the UK GDPR;
® appropriate reporting structures; and
@ assessment and evaluation procedures.

If you are a smaller organisation you will most likely benefit from a smaller scale approach to
accountability. Amongst other things you should:

® ensure a good level of understanding and awareness of data protection amongst your staff;
@ implement comprehensive but proportionate policies and procedures for handling personal data; and
e keep records of what you do and why.

Article 24(1) of the UK GDPR says that:

® you must implement technical and organisational measures to ensure, and demonstrate, compliance
with the UK GDPR;

@ the measures should be risk-based and proportionate; and
® you need to review and update the measures as necessary.

While the UK GDPR does not specify an exhaustive list of things you need to do to be accountable, it does
set out several different measures you can take that will help you get there. These are summarised under
the headings below, with links to the relevant parts of the guide. Some measures you are obliged to take
and some are voluntary. It will differ depending on what personal data you have and what you do with it.
These measures can form the basis of your programme controls if you opt to put in place a privacy
management framework across your organisation.

Should we implement data protection policies?

For many organisations, putting in place relevant policies is a fundamental part of their approach to data
protection compliance. The UK GDPR explicitly says that, where proportionate, implementing data
protection policies is one of the measures you can take to ensure, and demonstrate, compliance.

What you have policies for, and their level of detail, depends on what you do with personal data. If, for
instance, you handle large volumes of personal data, or particularly sensitive information such as special
category data, then you should take greater care to ensure that your policies are robust and
comprehensive.

As well as drafting data protection policies, you should also be able to show that you have implemented and
adhered to them. This could include awareness raising, training, monitoring and audits — all tasks that your
data protection officer can undertake (see below for more on data protection officers).

Should we adopt a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach?

Privacy by design has long been seen as a good practice approach when designing new products, processes
and systems that use personal data. Under the heading ‘data protection by design and by default’, the UK
GDPR legally requires you to take this approach.

Data protection by design and default is an integral element of being accountable. It is about embedding
data protection into everything you do, throughout all your processing operations. The UK GDPR suggests
measures that may be appropriate such as minimising the data you collect, applying pseudonymisation
techniques, and improving security features.

Integrating data protection considerations into your operations helps you to comply with your obligations,
while documenting the decisions you take (often in data protection impact assessments — see below)
demonstrates this.

Anonymisation code of practice

Do we need to use contracts?

Whenever a controller uses a processor to handle personal data on their behalf, it needs to put in place a
written contract that sets out each party’s responsibilities and liabilities.

Contracts must include certain specific terms as a minimum, such as requiring the processor to take
appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing and obliging it to assist the controller in allowing
individuals to exercise their rights under the UK GDPR.

Using clear and comprehensive contracts with your processors helps to ensure that everyone understands
their data protection obligations and is a good way to demonstrate this formally.

Contracts
Documentation

What documentation should we maintain?

Under Article 30 of the UK GDPR, most organisations are required to maintain a record of their processing
activities, covering areas such as processing purposes, data sharing and retention.

Documenting this information is a great way to take stock of what you do with personal data. Knowing
what information you have, where it is and what you do with it makes it much easier for you to comply with
other aspects of the UK GDPR such as making sure that the information you hold about people is accurate
and secure.

As well as your record of processing activities under Article 30, you also need to document other things to
show your compliance with the UK GDPR. For instance, you need to keep records of consent and any
personal data breaches.

What security measures should we put in place?

The UK GDPR repeats the requirement to implement technical and organisational measures to comply with
the UK GDPR in the context of security. It says that these measures should ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk.

You need to implement security measures if you are handling any type of personal data, but what you put

613


--- New Page 175 ---
Page number: 175
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

in place depends on your particular circumstances. You need to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the systems and services you use to process personal data.

Amongst other things, this may include information security policies, access controls, security monitoring,
and recovery plans.

How do we record and report personal data breaches?

You must report certain types of personal data breach to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and
in some circumstances, to the affected individuals as well.

Additionally, the UK GDPR says that you must keep a record of any personal data breaches, regardless of
whether you need to report them or not.

You need to be able to detect, investigate, report (both internally and externally) and document any
breaches. Having robust policies, procedures and reporting structures helps you do this.

Should we carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)?

A DPIA is an essential accountability tool and a key part of taking a data protection by design approach to
what you do. It helps you to identify and minimise the data protection risks of any new projects you
undertake.

A DPIA is a legal requirement before carrying out processing likely to result in high risk to individuals’
interests.

When done properly, a DPIA helps you assess how to comply with the requirements of the UK GDPR, while
also acting as documented evidence of your decision-making and the steps you took.

Codes of conduct and certification

 

What else should we consider?

The above measures can help to support an accountable approach to data protection, but it is not limited to
these. You need to be able to prove what steps you have taken to comply. In practice this means keeping
records of what you do and justifying your decisions.

Example

A company wants to use the personal data it holds for a new purpose. It carries out an assessment in
line with Article 6(4) of the UK GDPR, and determines that the new purpose is compatible with the
original purpose for which it collected the personal data. Although this provision of the UK GDPR does
not specify that the company must document its compatibility assessment, it knows that to be
accountable, it needs to be able to prove that their handling of personal data is compliant with the UK
GDPR. The company therefore keeps a record of the compatibility assessment, including its rationale
for the decision and the appropriate safeguards it put in place.

Accountability is not just about being answerable to the regulator; you must also demonstrate your
compliance to individuals. Amongst other things, individuals have the right to be informed about what
personal data you collect, why you use it and who you share it with. Additionally, if you use techniques such
as artificial intelligence and machine learning to make decisions about people, in certain cases individuals
have the right to hold you to account by requesting explanations of those decisions and contesting them.
You therefore need to find effective ways to provide information to people about what you do with their
personal data, and explain and review automated decisions.

The obligations that accountability places on you are ongoing - you cannot simply sign off a particular
processing operation as ‘accountable’ and move on. You must review the measures you implement at
appropriate intervals to ensure that they remain effective. You should update measures that are no longer
fit for purpose. If you regularly change what you do with personal data, or the types of information that
you collect, you should review and update your measures frequently, remembering to document what you
do and why.

Data protection fee

On 25 May 2018, the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 (the 2018 Regulations)
came into force, changing the way we fund our data protection work.

Under the 2018 Regulations, organisations that determine the purpose for which personal data is processed
(controllers) must pay a data protection fee unless they are exempt.

The new data protection fee replaces the requirement to ‘notify’ (or register), which was in the Data
Protection Act 1998 (the 1998 Act).

Although the 2018 Regulations come into effect on 25 May 2018, this doesn’t mean everyone now has to
pay the new fee. Controllers who have a current registration (or notification) under the 1998 Act do not
have to pay the new fee until that registration has expired.

From 1 April 2019, the Data Protection (Charges and Information) (Amendment) Regulations 2019
exempted the processing of personal data by members of the House of Lords, elected representatives
and prospective representatives.

‘Elected representatives’ is defined by the Data Protection Act 2018 and includes, but is not limited to,
MPs, MSPs, AMs in Wales, MEPs, elected councillors in county councils, district councils, London
boroughs, parish councils, elected mayors and police and crime commissioners.

‘Prospective representative’ refers to anyone seeking to become an elected representative as defined
above.

Certification

Certification is a way for an organisation to demonstrate compliance with UK GDPR. Certification scheme
criteria will be approved by the ICO and can cover a specific issue or be more general. Once an accredited
certification body has assessed and approved an organisation, it will issue them with a certificate, and a
seal or mark relevant to that scheme.

@ In detail

® Certification scheme register

What is the purpose of certification?

Certification is a way of demonstrating that your processing of personal data complies with the UK GDPR
requirements, in line with the accountability principle. Certification can help demonstrate data protection in
a practical way to businesses, individuals and regulators. Your customers can use certification as a means
to quickly assess the level of data protection of your particular product, process or service, which provides
transparency both for data subjects and in business to business relationships.

The UK GDPR says that certification is also a means to:

620


--- New Page 182 ---
Page number: 182
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ demonstrate compliance with the provisions on data protection by design and by default (Article 25(3));

@ demonstrate that you have appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure data security
(Article 32(3)); and

e@ to support transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations (Article 46(2)(f)).

Who is responsible for certification?

The ICO encourages the use of data protection certification mechanisms as a means to enhance
transparency and compliance with the UK GDPR.

The certification framework involves:

@ us publishing accreditation requirements for certification bodies to meet;

e@ the UK’s national accreditation body, UKAS, accrediting certification bodies and maintaining a public
register;

® us approving and publishing certification criteria;
® accredited certification bodies issuing certification against those criteria;
@ controllers and processors applying for certification and using it to demonstrate compliance; and

@ the ICO maintaining a public register of approved certification schemes.

What can be certified?

The scope of a certification scheme could be quite general and be applied to a variety of different products,
processes or services; or it could be specific, for example, secure storage and protection of personal data
contained within a digital vault.

Certification will relate to specific personal data processing operations that take place in a product, process
or service offered by a controller or processor. Those processing operations will be assessed against the
certification criteria by the accredited certification body.

Certification can only be issued to data controllers and processors and cannot therefore be used to certify
individuals, for example data protection officers.

Article 42(2) also allows for the use of certification schemes for the purpose of demonstrating the existence
of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to UK GDPR for
international transfers of personal data.

What must certification scheme criteria contain?

Certification criteria must be:

e derived from UK GDPR principles and rules, as relevant to the scope of certification, ie:
e lawfulness of processing (Art 6-10)
@ principles of data processing (Art 5)
@ data subjects’ rights (Art 12-23)
e@ obligation to notify data breaches (Art 33)

621

e@ auditable (ie specify objectives and how they can be achieved so as to demonstrate compliance);
e@ relevant to the target audience;

@ inter-operable with other standards, for example ISO standards; and

@ scalable for application to different size or type of organisations.

Once your organisation has been successfully assessed by the accredited certification body, you will be
issued with a data protection certificate, seal or mark relevant to that scheme.

Why should we apply for certification of our processing?

Applying for certification is voluntary. However, if there is an approved certification scheme that covers your
processing activity, you may wish to consider working towards it as a way of demonstrating that you
comply with the UK GDPR.

Certification provides a framework for you to follow, thereby helping ensure compliance and offering
assurance that specific standards are being adhered to, for example in a processor to controller
relationship.

Obtaining certification for your processing can also help you to:

@ be more transparent and accountable - enabling businesses or individuals to distinguish which
processing activities, operations and services meet UK GDPR data protection requirements and they can
trust with their personal data;

@ have a competitive advantage;

® create effective safeguards to mitigate the risk around data processing and the rights and freedoms of
individuals;

@ improve standards by establishing best practice;
@ help with international transfers; and

@ mitigate against enforcement action.

What are the practical implications for us?

e As a controller or processor, you could obtain certification for your processing operations within your
products, processes and services. Certification bodies will use independent assessors, giving an
independent expert view on whether you meet the certification criteria. You will need to provide them
with all the necessary information and access to your processing activities to enable them to conduct the
certification procedure.

® Certification is valid for a maximum of three years, subject to periodic reviews. These independent
reviews provide assurance that the certification can be trusted. However, certifications can be withdrawn

622


--- New Page 184 ---
Page number: 184
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

if you no longer meet the certification criteria, and the certification body will notify us of this.

@ Your customers can view your certification in a public register of certificates published by certification
bodies.

®@ Certification can help you demonstrate compliance but does not reduce your wider data protection
responsibilities outside the certified processing activity.

@ When contracting work to third parties, you may wish to consider whether they hold a UK GDPR
certificate for their processing operations, as part of meeting your due diligence requirements under the
UK GDPR.

What happens next?

You can find details of approved certification schemes in the register of certification criteria. If there is a
scheme that meets your needs, you should contact the relevant certification body who is accredited to
operate the scheme.

Codes of conduct

Under the UK GDPR, trade associations and other representative bodies may draw up codes of conduct that
identify and address data protection issues that are important to their members, such as fair and
transparent processing, pseudonymisation or the exercise of people’s rights. They are a good way of
developing sector-specific guidelines to help with compliance with the UK GDPR. There is a real benefit to
developing a code of conduct as it can help to build public trust and confidence in your sector’s ability to
comply with data protection laws.

The ICO is committed to encouraging the development of codes of conduct and will provide advice and
support from the start on:

@ meeting the necessary criteria;

@ the requirements of the UK GDPR; and

® complex areas of data protection.

We welcome informal discussions with organisations as part of your development of your code of conduct
and prior to formal submission. Please read our detailed quidance pages for further information.

 

At a glance

@ Codes of conduct enable a sector to own and resolve key data protection challenges. The ICO see these
as a way of demonstrating accountability and encourage trade associations and bodies who are able to
speak on behalf of a group of organisations, to create codes of conduct.

@ Using an ICO approved code of conduct give assurance that the code and its monitoring is appropriate
and will help you to apply the UK GDPR effectively.

e@ In detail

What are codes of conduct?

Codes of conduct are voluntary accountability tools, enabling sectors to identify and resolve key data
protection challenges in their sector with assurance from ICO that the code, and its monitoring, is
appropriate. They can help you to reflect on your processing activities and ensure you follow rules designed
for your sector to achieve good practice. They are written by an organisation or association representing a
sector in a way that the sector understands and enable sectors to solve these challenges with advice and
support from the ICO.

By signing up to a code of conduct, controllers and processors can ensure they apply the UK GDPR
effectively and in doing so establish operational norms in compliance that ultimately should assist in
bringing down levels of non-compliance. Codes of conduct require a monitoring method, and for private or
non-public authorities, a monitoring body to deliver them.

Why sign up to a code of conduct?

Adhering to a code of conduct shows that you:
e follow UK GDPR requirements for data protection that have been agreed as good practice within your
sector; and

® are appropriately addressing the type of processing you are doing and the related level of risk. For
example, a code may contain specific sectoral requirements when it relates to processing of sensitive
special category personal data.

Adhering to a code of conduct could help you to:

@ be more transparent and accountable;

@ take into account the specific requirements of processing carried out in a sector and improve standards
by following best practice in a cost-effective way;

® promote confidence in a sector by creating effective safeguards to mitigate the risk around processing
activities;

626


--- New Page 188 ---
Page number: 188
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® earn the trust and confidence of data subjects and promote the rights and freedoms of individuals;
@ help with specific data protection areas, such as breach notification and privacy by design; and

@ improve the trust and confidence in your organisation’s compliance with UK GDPR and of the general
public about what happens to their personal data.

What should a code of conduct address?

Codes of conduct should help you to comply with the UK GDPR, and may cover topics such as fair and
transparent processing, legitimate interests, pseudonymisation or alternative, appropriate data protection
processing issues.

Codes of conduct should also reflect the specific needs of controllers and processors in small and medium
enterprises and help them to work together to apply UK GDPR requirements to specific issues that they
face.

Codes should provide added value for their sector, as they will tailor the UK GDPR requirements to the
sector or area of data processing. They could be a cost-effective means to enable compliance with the UK
GDPR for a sector and its members.

Who is responsible for codes of conduct?

Trade associations or bodies who are able to speak on behalf of controllers or processors can create a code
of conduct in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the public where feasible. They can amend
or extend existing codes to comply with UK GDPR requirements. They have to submit the draft code to us

for approval.

We encourage the creation of codes of conduct by actively engaging with sectors to encourage development
and uptake of codes of conduct where the sector would benefit. We will also support organisations who
approach the ICO with a proposal for a code of conduct.

We will:

e@ Provide advice and guidance to bodies considering or developing a code;
e check that codes meet the code criteria set out below;

@ accredit (approve) monitoring bodies;

® approve and publish codes of conduct; and

@ maintain a public register of all approved UK codes of conduct.

How will the ICO approve a code of conduct?

All codes of conduct received will be assessed against the following criteria to ensure that the code
submission addresses the following:
® Outlines the code owner's ability to represent controllers or processors covered by the code.

e@ Includes a concise statement explaining the purpose of the code, the benefits to members and how it
effectively applies the UK GDPR.

e Identifies processing operations that the code covers and the categories of controllers or processors that

627


--- New Page 189 ---
Page number: 189
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

it applies to as well as what the data protection issues are that it intends to address.
@ Identifies suitable monitoring methods to assess code member compliance with the code.

© Identifies the monitoring body and its legal status (only required for codes covering non-public
authorities).

® Outlines the stakeholder consultation and outcomes.
@ Complies with other relevant national legislation, where required.

e@ Specifies whether it is a national code or a code for use as an international transfer tool.

How will compliance with the code be monitored?

All codes of conduct must contain suitable methods to allow for effective monitoring of code member
compliance and outline appropriate action in cases of infringement. In all cases these methods will need to
be clear, suitable and efficient.

Codes of conduct covering the private sector, or any non-public bodies will also have to identify a
monitoring body to fulfil the code monitoring requirements. Monitoring bodies must be accredited
(approved) by the ICO.

How to become a monitoring body

There are a number of requirements that should be met in order for a monitoring body to gain ICO
accreditation. Code owners will need to demonstrate as a minimum how their proposed monitoring body:
@ Is independent from code owners.
® Can act free from sanctions or external influence to ensure that no conflict of interest arises.
@ Has the required knowledge and expertise.
e@ Has established procedures and sufficient resources for the monitoring of compliance with the code.
@ Has an open and transparent complaints handling process.
@ Will communicate to the ICO infringements that lead to suspensions or exclusions of code members.
@ Will review the code to ensure that the code remains relevant and up to date.
@ Has appropriate legal status.

The ICO accreditation requirements can be found here. You can also find out more about monitoring body
accreditation on our detailed guidance pages.

 

 

How can we demonstrate independence for an internal monitoring body?

A code owner will have to demonstrate how the monitoring body can remain impartial from, code members,
the profession, industry or sector to which the code applies.

How this will work in practice will vary depending on the code topic, the sector and the organisations
involved so there is no universal approach to demonstrating independence.

Code owners will need to consider the risks to impartiality and demonstrate how they will minimise or
remove these risks on an ongoing basis.

628


--- New Page 190 ---
Page number: 190
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

We expect that in some cases existing models of self-regulation or co -regulation familiar to representative
bodies and trade associations may be adapted to meet these requirements. Existing good practice in these
areas could all help to prove impartiality, such as:

@ being able to evidence the ability to act free from inappropriate influence;
@ separate decision-making arrangements;
@ separate staff and governance reporting lines;

@ separate funding arrangements or budget management; and

@ technical measures, such as information barriers.

What are the practical implications for our organisation?

@ You can sign up to a code of conduct relevant to your data processing activities or sector. This could be
an extension or an amendment to a current code, or a brand-new code.

e Your customers will be able to view your code membership via the code’s webpage and the ICO’s public
register of UK approved codes of conduct.

@ Once you are assessed as adhering to the code, your compliance with the code will be monitored on a
regular basis. This monitoring provides assurance that the code can be trusted. Your membership can be
withdrawn if you no longer meet the requirements of the code, and the monitoring body will notify us of
this.

@ When contracting work to third parties, you may wish to consider whether they have signed up to a code
of conduct, as part of meeting your due diligence requirements under the UK GDPR.

How do we sign up to become a code member?

The ICO has not yet formally approved any codes of conduct. You may wish to contact your trade
association/representative body or a body able to legitimately speak on your behalf to discuss whether they
are developing a code in your sector.

For further information please see our detailed guidance pages.

 

Next steps

We welcome enquiries from organisations who are considering writing, monitoring or signing up to a code
of conduct, you can find out more about this on the detailed guidance pages.

We have published detailed guidance on codes of conduct.

Data protection officers

At a glance

e The UK GDPR introduces a duty for you to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if you are a public
authority or body, or if you carry out certain types of processing activities.

@ DPOs assist you to monitor internal compliance, inform and advise on your data protection obligations,
provide advice regarding Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and act as a contact point for
data subjects and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

e The DPO must be independent, an expert in data protection, adequately resourced, and report to the
highest management level.

@ A DPO can be an existing employee or externally appointed.
e In some cases several organisations can appoint a single DPO between them.

@ DPOs can help you demonstrate compliance and are part of the enhanced focus on accountability.

Checklists

Appointing a DPO

OU We are a public authority or body and have appointed a DPO (except if we are a court acting in
our judicial capacity).

OU We are not a public authority or body, but we know whether the nature of our processing
activities requires the appointment of a DPO.

OU We have appointed a DPO based on their professional qualities and expert knowledge of data
protection law and practices.

Oo We aren’t required to appoint a DPO under the UK GDPR but we have decided to do so
voluntarily. We understand that the same duties and responsibilities apply had we been required to
appoint a DPO. We support our DPO to the same standards.

Position of the DPO

O Our DPO reports directly to our highest level of management and is given the required
independence to perform their tasks.

O We involve our DPO, in a timely manner, in all issues relating to the protection of personal data.
O Our DPO is sufficiently well resourced to be able to perform their tasks.
O We do not penalise the DPO for performing their duties.

XO We ensure that any other tasks or duties we assign our DPO do not result in a conflict of
interests with their role as a DPO.

631

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Tasks of the DPO

O Our DPO is tasked with monitoring compliance with the UK GDPR and other data protection laws,
our data protection policies, awareness-raising, training, and audits.

O We will take account of our DPO’s advice and the information they provide on our data protection
obligations.

OX When carrying out a DPIA, we seek the advice of our DPO who also monitors the process.

O Our DPO acts as a contact point for the ICO. They co-operate with the ICO, including during prior
consultations under Article 36, and will consult on any other matter.

CO When performing their tasks, our DPO has due regard to the risk associated with processing
operations, and takes into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing.

Accessibility of the DPO

O Our DPO is easily accessible as a point of contact for our employees, individuals and the ICO.

O We have published the contact details of the DPO and communicated them to the ICO.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Under the UK GDPR, you must appoint a DPO if:

® you are a public authority or body (except for courts acting in their judicial capacity);

® your core activities require large scale, regular and systematic monitoring of individuals (for example,
online behaviour tracking); or

® your core activities consist of large scale processing of special categories of data or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences.

This applies to both controllers and processors. You can appoint a DPO if you wish, even if you aren’t
required to. If you decide to voluntarily appoint a DPO you should be aware that the same requirements of
the position and tasks apply had the appointment been mandatory.

Regardless of whether the UK GDPR obliges you to appoint a DPO, you must ensure that your organisation
has sufficient staff and resources to discharge your obligations under the UK GDPR. However, a DPO can
help you operate within the law by advising and helping to monitor compliance. In this way, a DPO can be
seen to play a key role in your organisation’s data protection governance structure and to help improve
accountability.

If you decide that you don’t need to appoint a DPO, either voluntarily or because you don’t meet the above
criteria, it’s a good idea to record this decision to help demonstrate compliance with the accountability
principle.

For organisations

What is the definition of a public authority?

Section 7 of the Data Protection Act 2018 defines what a ‘public authority’ and a ‘public body’ are for the
purposes of the UK GDPR.

What are ‘core activities’?

The other two conditions that require you to appoint a DPO only apply when:

® your core activities consist of processing activities, which, by virtue of their nature, scope and / or their
purposes, require the regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale; or

® your core activities consist of processing on a large scale of special category data, or data relating to
criminal convictions and offences.

Your core activities are the primary business activities of your organisation. So, if you need to process
personal data to achieve your key objectives, this is a core activity. This is different to processing personal
data for other secondary purposes, which may be something you do all the time (eg payroll or HR
information), but which is not part of carrying out your primary objectives.

633


--- New Page 195 ---
Page number: 195
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

For most organisations, processing personal data for HR purposes will be a secondary function to their
main business activities and so will not be part of their core activities.

However, a HR service provider necessarily processes personal data as part of its core activities to
provide HR functions for its client organisations. At the same time, it will also process HR information
for its own employees, which will be regarded as an ancillary function and not part of its core activities.

What does ‘regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale’ mean?

There are two key elements to this condition requiring you to appoint a DPO. Although the UK GDPR does
not define ‘regular and systematic monitoring’ or ‘large scale’, the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) provided

Protection Board (EDPB) which has endorsed these guidelines. Although these guidelines relate to the EU
version of the GDPR, they are also a useful resource for understanding the requirements of the UK GDPR.

‘Regular and systematic’ monitoring of data subjects includes all forms of tracking and profiling, both online
and offline. An example of this is for the purposes of behavioural advertising.

When determining if processing is on a large scale, the guidelines say you should take the following factors
into consideration:

e the numbers of data subjects concerned;

@ the volume of personal data being processed;

e@ the range of different data items being processed;

@ the geographical extent of the activity; and

e the duration or permanence of the processing activity.

Example

A large retail website uses algorithms to monitor the searches and purchases of its users and, based on
this information, it offers recommendations to them. As this takes place continuously and according to
predefined criteria, it can be considered as regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a
large scale.

What does processing special category data and personal data relating to criminal convictions
and offences on a large scale mean?

Processing special category data or criminal conviction or offences data carries more risk than other

634


--- New Page 196 ---
Page number: 196
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

personal data. So when you process this type of data on a large scale you are required to appoint a DPO,
who can provide more oversight. Again, the factors relevant to large-scale processing can include:

e the numbers of data subjects;

e@ the volume of personal data being processed;

e the range of different data items being processed;
@ the geographical extent of the activity; and

@ the duration or permanence of the activity.

Example

A health insurance company processes a wide range of personal data about a large number of
individuals, including medical conditions and other health information. This can be considered as
processing special category data on a large scale.

What professional qualities should the DPO have?

e The UK GDPR says that you should appoint a DPO on the basis of their professional qualities, and in
particular, experience and expert knowledge of data protection law.

@ It doesn’t specify the precise credentials they are expected to have, but it does say that this should be
proportionate to the type of processing you carry out, taking into consideration the level of protection
the personal data requires.

e So, where the processing of personal data is particularly complex or risky, the knowledge and abilities of
the DPO should be correspondingly advanced enough to provide effective oversight.

e@ It would be an advantage for your DPO to also have a good knowledge of your industry or sector, as well
as your data protection needs and processing activities.

What are the tasks of the DPO?

The DPO’s tasks are defined in Article 39 as:
@ to inform and advise you and your employees about your obligations to comply with the UK GDPR and
other data protection laws;

@ to monitor compliance with the UK GDPR and other data protection laws, and with your data protection
polices, including managing internal data protection activities; raising awareness of data protection
issues, training staff and conducting internal audits;

@ to advise on, and to monitor, data protection impact assessments;
@ to cooperate with the ICO; and

@ to be the first point of contact for the ICO and for individuals whose data is processed (employees,
customers etc).

635


--- New Page 197 ---
Page number: 197
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

It’s important to remember that the DPO’s tasks cover all personal data processing activities, not just those
that require their appointment under Article 37(1).

@ When carrying out their tasks the DPO is required to take into account the risk associated with the
processing you are undertaking. They must have regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of
the processing.

e The DPO should prioritise and focus on the more risky activities, for example where special category
data is being processed, or where the potential impact on individuals could be damaging. Therefore,
DPOs should provide risk-based advice to your organisation.

e If you decide not to follow the advice given by your DPO, you should document your reasons to help
demonstrate your accountability.

Can we assign other tasks to the DPO?

The UK GDPR says that you can assign further tasks and duties, so long as they don’t result in a conflict of
interests with the DPO’s primary tasks.

Example

As an example of assigning other tasks, Article 30 requires that organisations must maintain records of
processing operations. There is nothing preventing this task being allocated to the DPO.

Basically this means the DPO cannot hold a position within your organisation that leads him or her to
determine the purposes and the means of the processing of personal data. At the same time, the DPO
shouldn't be expected to manage competing objectives that could result in data protection taking a
secondary role to business interests.

Examples

A company’s head of marketing plans an advertising campaign, including which of the company’s
customers to target, what method of communication and the personal details to use. This person
cannot also be the company’s DPO, as the decision-making is likely to lead to a conflict of interests
between the campaign’s aims and the company’s data protection obligations.

On the other hand, a public authority could appoint its existing FOI officer / records manager as its
DPO. There is no conflict of interests here as these roles are about ensuring information rights
compliance, rather than making decisions about the purposes of processing.

Can the DPO be an existing employee?

Yes. As long as the professional duties of the employee are compatible with the duties of the DPO and do

636


--- New Page 198 ---
Page number: 198
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

not lead to a conflict of interests, you can appoint an existing employee as your DPO, rather than you
having to create a new post.

Can we contract out the role of the DPO?

You can contract out the role of DPO externally, based on a service contract with an individual or an
organisation. It’s important to be aware that an externally-appointed DPO should have the same position,
tasks and duties as an internally-appointed one.

Can we share a DPO with other organisations?

@ You may appoint a single DPO to act for a group of companies or public authorities.

e If your DPO covers several organisations, they must still be able to perform their tasks effectively, taking
into account the structure and size of those organisations. This means you should consider if one DPO
can realistically cover a large or complex collection of organisations. You need to ensure they have the
necessary resources to carry out their role and be supported with a team, if this is appropriate.

e Your DPO must be easily accessible, so their contact details should be readily available to your
employees, to the ICO, and people whose personal data you process.

Can we have more than one DPO?

e The UK GDPR clearly provides that an organisation must appoint a single DPO to carry out the tasks
required in Article 39, but this doesn’t prevent it appointing other data protection specialists as part of a
team to help support the DPO.

e You need to determine the best way to set up your organisation’s DPO function and whether this
necessitates a data protection team. However, there must be an individual designated as the DPO for
the purposes of the UK GDPR who meets the requirements set out in Articles 37-39.

e If you have a team, you should clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of its members and how it
relates to the DPO.

e If you hire data protection specialists other than a DPO, it’s important that they are not referred to as
your DPO, which is a specific role with particular requirements under the UK GDPR.

What do we have to do to support the DPO?

You must ensure that:

e the DPO is involved, closely and in a timely manner, in all data protection matters;
e the DPO reports to the highest management level of your organisation, ie board level;
@ the DPO operates independently and is not dismissed or penalised for performing their tasks;

@ you provide adequate resources (sufficient time, financial, infrastructure, and, where appropriate, staff)
to enable the DPO to meet their UK GDPR obligations, and to maintain their expert level of knowledge;

@ you give the DPO appropriate access to personal data and processing activities;

@ you give the DPO appropriate access to other services within your organisation so that they can receive
essential support, input or information;

@ you seek the advice of your DPO when carrying out a DPIA; and

637


--- New Page 199 ---
Page number: 199
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® you record the details of your DPO as part of your records of processing activities.

This shows the importance of the DPO to your organisation and that you must provide sufficient support so
they can carry out their role independently. Part of this is the requirement for your DPO to report to the
highest level of management. This doesn’t mean the DPO has to be line managed at this level but they
must have direct access to give advice to senior managers who are making decisions about personal data
processing.

What details do we have to publish about the DPO?

The UK GDPR requires you to:

@ publish the contact details of your DPO; and
@ provide them to the ICO.

This is to enable individuals, your employees and the ICO to contact the DPO as needed. You aren’t
required to include the name of the DPO when publishing their contact details but you can choose to
provide this if you think it’s necessary or helpful.

You're also required to provide your DPO’s contact details in the following circumstances:

@ when consulting the ICO under Article 36 about a DPIA; and

@ when providing privacy information to individuals under Articles 13 and 14.

ICO and to those individuals affected by it.

Is the DPO responsible for compliance?

The DPO isn’t personally liable for data protection compliance. As the controller or processor it remains
your responsibility to comply with the UK GDPR. Nevertheless, the DPO clearly plays a crucial role in
helping you to fulfil your organisation’s data protection obligations.

Data protection impact assessments

The Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020. The GDPR has been retained in UK law as the
UK GDPR, and will continue to be read alongside the Data Protection Act 2018, with technical
amendments to ensure it can function in UK law. If you transfer or receive data from overseas please
visit our End of Transition and International Transfers pages. You should make sure you can identify any
data you collected before the end of 2020 about people outside the UK, for further information, see our
Q&A on Legacy Data.

 

On 01 January, there will not be any significant change to the UK data protection regime, or to the
criteria that compel DPIAs. This guidance draws on European resources which we still consider to be
relevant, and so these resources remain part of our DPIA guidance.

We will keep this guidance under review and update it as and when any aspect of your obligations or
our approach changes. Please continue to monitor our website for updates.

e Click here for a sample DPIA Template @
® Click here to contact the ICO about your DPIA

At a glance

e A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process to help you identify and minimise the data
protection risks of a project.

e@ You must do a DPIA for processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. This includes
some specified types of processing. You can use our screening checklists to help you decide when to do
a DPIA.

e@ It is also good practice to do a DPIA for any other major project which requires the processing of
personal data.

@ Your DPIA must:
e describe the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing;
® assess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures;
e identify and assess risks to individuals; and
@ identify any additional measures to mitigate those risks.
@ To assess the level of risk, you must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on

individuals. High risk could result from either a high probability of some harm, or a lower possibility of
serious harm.

@ You should consult your data protection officer (if you have one) and, where appropriate, individuals and
relevant experts. Any processors may also need to assist you.

e If you identify a high risk that you cannot mitigate, you must consult the ICO before starting the
processing.

e If you are processing for law-enforcement purposes, you should read this alongside the Guide to Law
Enforcement Processing.

e The ICO will give written advice within eight weeks, or 14 weeks in complex cases. If appropriate, we
may issue a formal warning not to process the data, or ban the processing altogether.

@ In more detail

What is a DPIA?

A DPIA is a way for you to systematically and comprehensively analyse your processing and help you
identify and minimise data protection risks.

DPIAs should consider compliance risks, but also broader risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals,
including the potential for any significant social or economic disadvantage. The focus is on the potential for
harm -— to individuals or to society at large, whether it is physical, material or non-material.

To assess the level of risk, a DPIA must consider both the likelihood and the severity of any impact on
individuals.

A DPIA does not have to indicate that all risks have been eradicated. But it should help you document them
and assess whether or not any remaining risks are justified.

DPIAs are a legal requirement for processing that is likely to be high risk. But an effective DPIA can also
bring broader compliance, financial and reputational benefits, helping you demonstrate accountability and

644


--- New Page 206 ---
Page number: 206
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

building trust and engagement with individuals.

A DPIA may cover a single processing operation or a group of similar processing operations. A group of
controllers can do a joint DPIA.

It’s important to embed DPIAs into your organisational processes and ensure the outcome can influence
your plans. A DPIA is not a one-off exercise. You should see it as an ongoing process that is subject to
regular review.

When do we need a DPIA?

You must do a DPIA before you begin any type of processing that is “likely to result in a high risk”. This
means that although you have not yet assessed the actual level of risk, you need to screen for factors that
point to the potential for a widespread or serious impact on individuals.

In particular, the UK GDPR says you must do a DPIA if you plan to:

® use systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects;
® process special category or criminal offence data on a large scale; or

e@ systematically monitor publicly accessible places on a large scale.

When considering if your processing is likely to result in high risk, you should consider the relevant

the guidelines suggest that, in most cases, any processing operation involving two or more of these criteria
requires a DPIA, you may consider in your case that just meeting one criterion could require a DPIA.

The ICO also requires you to do a DPIA if you plan to:

® use innovative technology (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);
e@ use profiling or special category data to decide on access to services;

e profile individuals on a large scale;

® process biometric data (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

® process genetic data (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

@ match data or combine datasets from different sources;

® collect personal data from a source other than the individual without providing them with a privacy
notice (‘invisible processing’) (in combination with any of the criteria from the European guidelines);

@ track individuals’ location or behaviour (in combination with any of the criteria from the European
guidelines);

@ profile children or target marketing or online services at them; or
® process data that might endanger the individual’s physical health or safety in the event of a security
breach.

You should also think carefully about doing a DPIA for any other processing that is large scale, involves
profiling or monitoring, decides on access to services or opportunities, or involves sensitive data or
vulnerable individuals.

Even if there is no specific indication of likely high risk, it is good practice to do a DPIA for any major new

645

screening exercise.

How do we carry out a DPIA?
A DPIA should begin early in the life of a project, before you start your processing, and run alongside the

planning and development process. It should include these steps:

sm [eC=T aa =e el
EB) Py

&: Inte
outcomes

7: Sign off and

record outcomes

 

You must seek the advice of your data protection officer (if you have one). You should also consult with
individuals and other stakeholders throughout this process.

The process is designed to be flexible and scalable. You can use or adapt our sample DPIA template @, or
create your own. If you want to create your own, you may want to refer to the European guidelines which
set out Criteria for an acceptable DPIAC

 

 

Although publishing a DPIA is not a requirement of UK GDPR, you should actively consider the benefits of
publication. As well as demonstrating compliance, publication can help engender trust and confidence. We
would therefore recommend that you publish your DPIAs, where possible, removing sensitive details if
necessary.

Do we need to consult the ICO?

You don’t need to send every DPIA to the ICO and we expect the percentage sent to us to be small. But
you must consult the ICO if your DPIA identifies a high risk and you cannot take measures to reduce that

risk. You cannot begin the processing until you have consulted us.

If you want your project to proceed effectively then investing time in producing a comprehensive DPIA may

prevent any delays later, if you have to consult with the ICO.
You need to send us a copy of your DPIA.

Once we have the information we need, we will generally respond within eight weeks (although we can
extend this by a further six weeks in complex cases).

We will provide you with a written response advising you whether the risks are acceptable, or whether you
need to take further action. In some cases we may advise you not to carry out the processing because we
consider it would be in breach of the GDPR. In appropriate cases we may issue a formal warning or take
action to ban the processing altogether.

Data protection by design and default

At a glance

@ The UK GDPR requires you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to
implement the data protection principles effectively and safeguard individual rights. This is ‘data
protection by design and by default’.

e@ In essence, this means you have to integrate or ‘bake in’ data protection into your processing activities
and business practices, from the design stage right through the lifecycle.

e@ This concept is not new. Previously known as ‘privacy by design’, it has always been part of data
protection law. The key change with the UK GDPR is that it is now a legal requirement.

® Data protection by design is about considering data protection and privacy issues upfront in everything
you do. It can help you ensure that you comply with the UK GDPR’s fundamental principles and
requirements, and forms part of the focus on accountability.

What does the UK GDPR say about data protection by design and by default?

The UK GDPR requires you to integrate data protection concerns into every aspect of your processing
activities. This approach is ‘data protection by design and by default’. It is a key element of the UK GDPR’s
risk-based approach and its focus on accountability, ie your ability to demonstrate how you are complying
with its requirements.

Some organisations already adopt a ‘privacy by design approach’ as a matter of good practice. If this is the
case for you, then you are well-placed to meet the requirements of data protection by design and by
default. However, you may still need to review your processes and procedures to ensure that you are
meeting your obligations.

Articles 25(1) and 25(2) of the GDPR outline your obligations concerning data protection by design and by
default.

Article 25(1) specifies the requirements for data protection by design:

649


--- New Page 211 ---
Page number: 211
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and
purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of
natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of
the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection
principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards
into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data
subjects.’

Article 25(2) specifies the requirements for data protection by default:

66

‘The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by
default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are
processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their
processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure
that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an
indefinite number of natural persons.’

Article 25(3) states that if you adhere to an approved certification under Article 42, you can use this as one
way of demonstrating your compliance with these requirements.

What is data protection by design?

Data protection by design is ultimately an approach that ensures you consider privacy and data protection
issues at the design phase of any system, service, product or process and then throughout the lifecycle.

As expressed by the UK GDPR, it requires you to:

@ put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement the data
protection principles effectively; and

@ integrate safeguards into your processing so that you meet the UK GDPR's requirements and protect
individual rights.

In essence this means you have to integrate or ‘bake in’ data protection into your processing activities and
business practices.

650

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Data protection by design has broad application. Examples include:

e developing new IT systems, services, products and processes that involve processing personal data;

e developing organisational policies, processes, business practices and/or strategies that have privacy
implications;

@ physical design;
@ embarking on data sharing initiatives; or
® using personal data for new purposes.

The underlying concepts of data protection by design are not new. Under the name ‘privacy by design’ they
have existed for many years.

What is data protection by default?

Data protection by default requires you to ensure that you only process the data that is necessary to

You have to process some personal data to achieve your purpose(s). Data protection by default means you
need to specify this data before the processing starts, appropriately inform individuals and only process the
data you need for your purpose. It does not require you to adopt a ‘default to off’ solution. What you need
to do depends on the circumstances of your processing and the risks posed to individuals.

Nevertheless, you must consider things like:

@ adopting a ‘privacy-first’ approach with any default settings of systems and applications;
@ ensuring you do not provide an illusory choice to individuals relating to the data you will process;
@ not processing additional data unless the individual decides you can;

® ensuring that personal data is not automatically made publicly available to others unless the individual
decides to make it so; and

@ providing individuals with sufficient controls and options to exercise their rights.

Who is responsible for complying with data protection by design and by default?

Article 25 specifies that, as the controller, you have responsibility for complying with data protection by
design and by default. Depending on your circumstances, you may have different requirements for different
areas within your organisation. For example:

® your senior management, eg developing a culture of ‘privacy awareness’ and ensuring you develop
policies and procedures with data protection in mind;

@ your software engineers, system architects and application developers, eg those who design systems,
products and services should take account of data protection requirements and assist you in complying
with your obligations; and

® your business practices, eg you should ensure that you embed data protection by design in all your
internal processes and procedures.

This may not apply to all organisations, of course. However, data protection by design is about adopting an

651


--- New Page 213 ---
Page number: 213
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

organisation-wide approach to data protection, and ‘baking in’ privacy considerations into any processing
activity you undertake. It doesn’t apply only if you are the type of organisation that has your own software
developers and systems architects.

In considering whether to impose a penalty, the ICO will take into account the technical and organisational
measures you have put in place in respect of data protection by design. Additionally, under the Data
Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) we can issue an Enforcement Notice against you for any failings in respect
of Article 25.

What about data processors?

If you use another organisation to process personal data on your behalf, then that organisation is a data
processor under the UK GDPR.

Article 25 does not mention data processors specifically. However, Article 28 specifies the considerations
you must take whenever you are selecting a processor. For example, you must only use processors that
provide:

66

‘sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a
manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of
the rights of the data subject’

This requirement covers both data protection by design in Article 25 as well as other aspects (eg your
security obligations under Article 32). Your processor cannot necessarily assist you with your data
protection by design obligations (unlike with security measures), however you must only use processors
that provide sufficient guarantees to meet the UK GDPR’s requirements.

What about other parties?

Data protection by design and by default can also impact organisations other than controllers and
processors. Depending on your processing activity, other parties may be involved, even if this is just where
you purchase a product or service that you then use in your processing. Examples include manufacturers,
product developers, application developers and service providers.

Recital 78 extends the concepts of data protection by design to other organisations, although it does not
place a requirement on them to comply —- that remains with you as the controller. It says:

66

‘When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and products that are based on
the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers of the products,
services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when

developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with regard to the state of the

art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations.’

652


--- New Page 214 ---
Page number: 214
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Therefore, when considering what products and services you need for your processing, you should look to
choose those where the designers and developers have taken data protection into account. This can help to
ensure that your processing adheres to the data protection by design requirements.

If you are a developer or designer of products, services and applications, the UK GDPR places no specific
obligations on you about how you design and build these products. (You may have specific obligations as a
controller in your own right, eg for any employee data.) However, you should note that controllers are
required to consider data protection by design when selecting services and products for use in their data
processing activities — therefore if you design these products with data protection in mind, you may be ina
better position.

What are we required to do?

You must put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement the data
protection principles effectively and safeguard individual rights.

There is no ‘one size fits all’ method to do this, and no one set of measures that you should put in place. It
depends on your circumstances.

The key is that you consider data protection issues from the start of any processing activity, and adopt
appropriate policies and measures that meet the requirements of data protection by design and by default.

Some examples of how you can do this include:

® minimising the processing of personal data;

@ pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible;

® ensuring transparency in respect of the functions and processing of personal data;
@ enabling individuals to monitor the processing; and

® creating (and improving) security features.

This is not an exhaustive list. Complying with data protection by design and by default may require you to
do much more than the above.

However, we cannot provide a complete guide to all aspects of data protection by design and by default in
all circumstances. This guidance identifies the main points for you to consider. Depending on the processing
you are doing, you may need to obtain specialist advice that goes beyond the scope of this guidance.

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

When should we do this?

Data protection by design starts at the initial phase of any system, service, product, or process. You
should begin by considering your intended processing activities, the risks that these may pose to
individuals, and the possible measures available to ensure that you comply with the data protection
principles and protect individual rights. These considerations must cover:

@ the state of the art and costs of implementation of any measures;
e the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing; and

e the risks that your processing poses to the rights and freedoms of individuals.
This is similar to the information risk assessment you should do when considering your security measures.

These considerations lead into the second step, where you put in place actual technical and organisational
measures to implement the data protection principles and integrate safeguards into your processing.

This is why there is no single solution or process that applies to every organisation or every processing
activity, although there are a number of commonalities that may apply to your specific circumstances as
described below.

The UK GDPR requires you to take these actions:

e ‘at the time of the determination of the means of the processing’ - in other words, when you are at the
design phase of any processing activity; and

e ‘at the time of the processing itself’ - ie during the lifecycle of your processing activity.

What are the underlying concepts of data protection by design and by default?

The underlying concepts are essentially expressed in the seven ‘foundational principles’ of privacy by
design, as developed by the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

Although privacy by design is not necessarily equivalent to data protection by design, these foundational
principles can nevertheless underpin any approach you take.

‘Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial’

You should take a proactive approach to data protection and anticipate privacy issues and risks before they
happen, instead of waiting until after the fact. This doesn’t just apply in the context of systems design - it
involves developing a culture of ‘privacy awareness’ across your organisation.

‘Privacy as the default setting’

You should design any system, service, product, and/or business practice to protect personal data
automatically. With privacy built into the system, the individual does not have to take any steps to protect
their data — their privacy remains intact without them having to do anything.

‘Privacy embedded into design’

Embed data protection into the design of any systems, services, products and business practices. You
should ensure data protection forms part of the core functions of any system or service - essentially, it

654


--- New Page 216 ---
Page number: 216
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

becomes integral to these systems and services.

‘Full functionality — positive sum, not zero sum’

Also referred to as ‘win-win’, this principle is essentially about avoiding trade-offs, such as the belief that in
any system or service it is only possible to have privacy or security, not privacy and security. Instead, you
should look to incorporate all legitimate objectives whilst ensuring you comply with your obligations.

‘End-to-end security — full lifecycle protection’

Put in place strong security measures from the beginning, and extend this security throughout the ‘data
lifecycle’ — ie process the data securely and then destroy it securely when you no longer need it.

‘Visibility and transparency —- keep it open’

Ensure that whatever business practice or technology you use operates according to its premises and
objectives, and is independently verifiable. It is also about ensuring visibility and transparency to
individuals, such as making sure they know what data you process and for what purpose(s) you process it.

‘Respect for user privacy — keep it user-centric’

Keep the interest of individuals paramount in the design and implementation of any system or service, eg
by offering strong privacy defaults, providing individuals with controls, and ensuring appropriate notice is
given.

How do we do this in practice?

One means of putting these concepts into practice is to develop a set of practical, actionable guidelines that
you can use in your organisation, framed by your assessment of the risks posed and the measures available
to you. You could base these upon the seven foundational principles.

However, how you go about doing this depends on your circumstances - who you are, what you are doing,
the resources you have available, and the nature of the data you process. You may not need to have a set
of documents and organisational controls in place, although in some situations you will be required to have
certain documents available concerning your processing.

The key is to take an organisational approach that achieves certain outcomes, such as ensuring that:
® you consider data protection issues as part of the design and implementation of systems, services,

products and business practices;

@ you make data protection an essential component of the core functionality of your processing systems
and services;

® you only process the personal data that you need in relation to your purposes(s), and that you only use
the data for those purposes;

® personal data is automatically protected in any IT system, service, product, and/or business practice, so
that individuals should not have to take any specific action to protect their privacy;

@ the identity and contact information of those responsible for data protection are available both within

655

your organisation and to individuals;

@ you adopt a ‘plain language’ policy for any public documents so that individuals easily understand what
you are doing with their personal data;

@ you provide individuals with tools so they can determine how you are using their personal data, and
whether you are properly enforcing your policies; and

e@ you offer strong privacy defaults, user-friendly options and controls, and respect user preferences.
Many of these relate to other obligations in the UK GDPR, such as transparency requirements,
documentation, Data Protection Officers and DPIAs. This shows the broad nature of data protection by

design and how it applies to all aspects of your processing. Our guidance on these topics will help you when
you consider the measures you need to put in place for data protection by design and by default.

How does data protection by design and by default link to data protection impact assessments
(DPIAs)?

A DPIA is a tool that you can use to identify and reduce the data protection risks of your processing
activities. They can also help you to design more efficient and effective processes for handling personal
data.

656


--- New Page 218 ---
Page number: 218
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

DPIAs are an integral part of data protection by design and by default. For example, they can determine
the type of technical and organisational measures you need in order to ensure your processing complies
with the data protection principles.

However, a DPIA is only required in certain circumstances, such as where the processing is likely to result
in a risk to rights and freedoms, though it is good practice to undertake a DPIA anyway. In contrast, data
protection by design is a broader concept, as it applies organisationally and requires you to take certain
considerations even before you decide whether your processing is likely to result in a high risk or not.

What is the role of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)?

Privacy-enhancing technologies or PETs are technologies that embody fundamental data protection
principles by minimising personal data use, maximising data security, and empowering individuals. A useful
definition from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) refers to PETs as:

‘software and hardware solutions, ie systems encompassing technical processes, methods or knowledge
to achieve specific privacy or data protection functionality or to protect against risks of privacy of an
individual or a group of natural persons.’

PETs link closely to the concept of privacy by design, and therefore apply to the technical measures you can
put in place. They can assist you in complying with the data protection principles and are a means of
implementing data protection by design within your organisation on a technical level.

on PETs that may assist you.

What about international transfers?

Data protection by design also applies in the context of international transfers in cases where you intend to
transfer personal data overseas to a third country that does not have an adequacy decision.

You need to ensure that, whatever mechanism you use, appropriate safeguards are in place for these
transfers. As detailed in Recital 108, these safeguards need to include compliance with data protection by
design and by default.

What is the role of certification?

Article 25(3) says that:

66

‘An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.’

This means that being certified through an ICO approved certification scheme can assist you in showing
how you are complying with, and implementing, data protection by design and by default.

 

What additional guidance is available?

The ICO will publish more detailed guidance about data protection by design and privacy enhancing

appropriate design in the DPA 2018 section 123.

aspects of the UK GDPR.

Who needs to document their processing activities?

© Controllers and processors each have their own documentation obligations.
e@ If you have 250 or more employees, you must document all your processing activities.

e There is a limited exemption for small and medium-sized organisations. If you have fewer than 250
employees, you only need to document processing activities that:

® are not occasional; or
@ could result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals; or

@ involve the processing of special categories of data or criminal conviction and offence data.

What do we need to document under Article 30 of the UK GDPR?

You must document the following information:
@ The name and contact details of your organisation (and where applicable, of other controllers, your
representative and your data protection officer).
e The purposes of your processing.
e A description of the categories of individuals and categories of personal data.
e The categories of recipients of personal data.

@ Details of your transfers to third countries including documenting the transfer mechanism safeguards in

Contracts

At a glance

e@ Whenever a controller uses a processor, there must be a written contract (or other legal act) in place.
@ The contract is important so that both parties understand their responsibilities and liabilities.
@ The UK GDPR sets out what needs to be included in the contract.

e If a processor uses another organisation (ie a sub-processor) to assist in its processing of personal data
for a controller, it needs to have a written contract in place with that sub-processor.

Checklists

What to include in the contract

The contract (or other legal act) sets out details of the processing including:

Oo the subject matter of the processing;

OO the duration of the processing;

Oo the nature and purpose of the processing;
Othe type of personal data involved;

OU the categories of data subject;

Oi the controller’s obligations and rights.

The contract or other legal act includes terms or clauses stating that:

XO the processor must only act on the controller’s documented instructions, unless required by law
to act without such instructions;

XO the processor must ensure that people processing the data are subject to a duty of confidence;
Oo the processor must take appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing;

HO the processor must only engage a sub-processor with the controller’s prior authorisation and
under a written contract;

Oo the processor must take appropriate measures to help the controller respond to requests from
individuals to exercise their rights;

@ What needs to be included in the contract?

@ What responsibilities and liabilities do controllers have when using a processor?
@ What responsibilities and liabilities do processors have in their own right?

@ In more detail

When is a contract needed and why is it important?

Whenever a controller uses a processor to process personal data on their behalf, a written contract needs to
be in place between the parties.

Similarly, if a processor uses another organisation (ie a sub-processor) to help it process personal data for
a controller, it needs to have a written contract in place with that sub-processor.

Contracts between controllers and processors ensure they both understand their obligations, responsibilities
and liabilities. Contracts also help them comply with the UK GDPR, and assist controllers in demonstrating
to individuals and regulators their compliance as required by the accountability principle.

What needs to be included in the contract?

Contracts must set out:

@ the subject matter and duration of the processing;
e the nature and purpose of the processing;
@ the type of personal data and categories of data subject; and

@ the controller’s obligations and rights.
Contracts must also include specific terms or clauses regarding:

@ processing only on the controller’s documented instructions;

@ the duty of confidence;

666

® appropriate security measures;
® using sub-processors;

e data subjects’ rights;

@ assisting the controller;

@ end-of-contract provisions; and

@ audits and inspections.

What responsibilities and liabilities do controllers have when using a processor?

Controllers must only use processors that can give sufficient guarantees they will implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure their processing will meet UK GDPR requirements and
protect data subjects’ rights.

Controllers are primarily responsible for overall compliance with the UK GDPR, and for demonstrating that
compliance. If this isn’t achieved, they may be liable to pay damages in legal proceedings or be subject to
fines or other penalties or corrective measures.

What responsibilities and liabilities do processors have in their own right?

In addition to its contractual obligations to the controller, a processor has some direct responsibilities under
the UK GDPR. If a processor fails to meet its obligations, or acts outside or against the controller’s
instructions, it may be liable to pay damages in legal proceedings or be subject to fines or other penalties
or corrective measures.

A processor may not engage a sub-processor’s services without the controller’s prior specific or general
written authorisation. If authorisation is given, the processor must put in place a contract with the
sub-processor. The terms of the contract that relate to Article 28(3) must offer an equivalent level of
protection for the personal data as those in the contract between the controller and processor. Processors
remain liable to the controller for the compliance of any sub-processors they engage.

Security

At a glance

e A key principle of the UK GDPR is that you process personal data securely by means of ‘appropriate
technical and organisational measures’ - this is the ‘security principle’.

@ Doing this requires you to consider things like risk analysis, organisational policies, and physical and
technical measures.

@ You also have to take into account additional requirements about the security of your processing - and
these also apply to data processors.

@ You can consider the state of the art and costs of implementation when deciding what measures to take
—- but they must be appropriate both to your circumstances and the risk your processing poses.

e@ Where appropriate, you should look to use measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption.

e Your measures must ensure the ‘confidentiality, integrity and availability’ of your systems and services
and the personal data you process within them.

e The measures must also enable you to restore access and availability to personal data in a timely
manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

e You also need to ensure that you have appropriate processes in place to test the effectiveness of your
measures, and undertake any required improvements.

@ We have worked closely with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to develop an approach that
you can use when assessing the measures that will be appropriate for you.

Checklists

OO We undertake an analysis of the risks presented by our processing, and use this to assess the
appropriate level of security we need to put in place.

XO When deciding what measures to implement, we take account of the state of the art and costs of
implementation.

O We have an information security policy (or equivalent) and take steps to make sure the policy is
implemented.

CU Where necessary, we have additional policies and ensure that controls are in place to enforce
them.

C1 We make sure that we regularly review our information security policies and measures and,
where necessary, improve them.

What does the UK GDPR say about security?

Article 5(1)(f) of the UK GDPR concerns the ‘integrity and confidentiality’ of personal data. It says that
personal data shall be:

669


--- New Page 231 ---
Page number: 231
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures’

You can refer to this as the UK GDPR’s ‘security principle’. It concerns the broad concept of information
security.

This means that you must have appropriate security in place to prevent the personal data you hold being
accidentally or deliberately compromised. You should remember that while information security is
sometimes considered as cybersecurity (the protection of your networks and information systems from
attack), it also covers other things like physical and organisational security measures.

You need to consider the security principle alongside Article 32 of the UK GDPR, which provides more
specifics on the security of your processing. Article 32(1) states:

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk’

Further Reading

Kr Relevant provisions in the UK GDPR - See Articles 5(1)(f) and 32, and Recitals 39 and 83 @

External link

Why should we worry about information security?

Poor information security leaves your systems and services at risk and may cause real harm and distress to
individuals — lives may even be endangered in some extreme cases.

Some examples of the harm caused by the loss or abuse of personal data include:

@ identity fraud;

e fake credit card transactions;

e@ targeting of individuals by fraudsters, potentially made more convincing by compromised personal data;
@ witnesses put at risk of physical harm or intimidation;

e offenders at risk from vigilantes;

® exposure of the addresses of service personnel, police and prison officers, and those at risk of domestic
violence;

678


--- New Page 232 ---
Page number: 232
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

e@ fake applications for tax credits; and

@ mortgage fraud.

Although these consequences do not always happen, you should recognise that individuals are still entitled
to be protected from less serious kinds of harm, for example embarrassment or inconvenience.

Information security is important, not only because it is itself a legal requirement, but also because it can
support good data governance and help you demonstrate your compliance with other aspects of the
UK GDPR.

The ICO is also required to consider the technical and organisational measures you had in place when
considering an administrative fine.

What do our security measures need to protect?

The security principle goes beyond the way you store or transmit information. Every aspect of your
processing of personal data is covered, not just cybersecurity. This means the security measures you put in
place should seek to ensure that:

e the data can be accessed, altered, disclosed or deleted only by those you have authorised to do so (and
that those people only act within the scope of the authority you give them);

e@ the data you hold is accurate and complete in relation to why you are processing it; and

e the data remains accessible and usable, ie, if personal data is accidentally lost, altered or destroyed, you

should be able to recover it and therefore prevent any damage or distress to the individuals concerned.

These are known as ‘confidentiality, integrity and availability’ and under the UK GDPR, they form part of
your obligations.

What level of security is required?

The UK GDPR does not define the security measures that you should have in place. It requires you to have
a level of security that is ‘appropriate’ to the risks presented by your processing. You need to consider this
in relation to the state of the art and costs of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context and
purpose of your processing.

This reflects both the UK GDPR’s risk-based approach, and that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to
information security. It means that what's ‘appropriate’ for you will depend on your own circumstances, the
processing you’re doing, and the risks it presents to your organisation.

So, before deciding what measures are appropriate, you need to assess your information risk. You should
review the personal data you hold and the way you use it in order to assess how valuable, sensitive or
confidential it is - as well as the damage or distress that may be caused if the data was compromised. You
should also take account of factors such as:

e the nature and extent of your organisation’s premises and computer systems;
@ the number of staff you have and the extent of their access to personal data; and

® any personal data held or used by a data processor acting on your behalf.

We cannot provide a complete guide to all aspects of security in all circumstances for all organisations, but
this guidance is intended to identify the main points for you to consider.

What organisational measures do we need to consider?

Carrying out an information risk assessment is one example of an organisational measure, but you will
need to take other measures as well. You should aim to build a culture of security awareness within your
organisation. You should identify a person with day-to-day responsibility for information security within
your organisation and make sure this person has the appropriate resources and authority to do their job
effectively.

Example

The Chief Executive of a medium-sized organisation asks the Director of Resources to ensure that
appropriate security measures are in place, and that regular reports are made to the board.

The Resources Department takes responsibility for designing and implementing the organisation’s
security policy, writing procedures for staff to follow, organising staff training, checking whether
security measures are actually being adhered to and investigating security incidents.

Clear accountability for security will ensure that you do not overlook these issues, and that your overall
security posture does not become flawed or out of date.

Although an information security policy is an example of an appropriate organisational measure, you may
not need a ‘formal’ policy document or an associated set of policies in specific areas. It depends on your
size and the amount and nature of the personal data you process, and the way you use that data. However,
having a policy does enable you to demonstrate how you are taking steps to comply with the security
principle.

Whether or not you have such a policy, you still need to consider security and other related matters such
as:

® co-ordination between key people in your organisation (eg the security manager will need to know about
commissioning and disposing of any IT equipment);

® access to premises or equipment given to anyone outside your organisation (eg for computer
maintenance) and the additional security considerations this will generate;

e@ business continuity arrangements that identify how you will protect and recover any personal data you
hold; and

® periodic checks to ensure that your security measures remain appropriate and up to date.

672


--- New Page 234 ---
Page number: 234
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

What technical measures do we need to consider?

Technical measures are sometimes thought of as the protection of personal data held in computers and
networks. Whilst these are of obvious importance, many security incidents can be due to the theft or loss of
equipment, the abandonment of old computers or hard-copy records being lost, stolen or incorrectly
disposed of. Technical measures therefore include both physical and computer or IT security.

When considering physical security, you should look at factors such as:

@ the quality of doors and locks, and the protection of your premises by such means as alarms, security
lighting or CCTV;

@ how you control access to your premises, and how visitors are supervised;

@ how you dispose of any paper and electronic waste; and

@ how you keep IT equipment, particularly mobile devices, secure.

In the IT context, technical measures may sometimes be referred to as ‘cybersecurity’. This is a complex
technical area that is constantly evolving, with new threats and vulnerabilities always emerging. It may
therefore be sensible to assume that your systems are vulnerable and take steps to protect them.

When considering cybersecurity, you should look at factors such as:
@ system security - the security of your network and information systems, including those which process

personal data;

e data security — the security of the data you hold within your systems, eg ensuring appropriate access
controls are in place and that data is held securely;

® online security - eg the security of your website and any other online service or application that you
use; and

@ device security - including policies on Bring-your-own-Device (BYOD) if you offer it.

Depending on the sophistication of your systems, your usage requirements and the technical expertise of
your staff, you may need to obtain specialist information security advice that goes beyond the scope of this
guidance. However, it’s also the case that you may not need a great deal of time and resources to secure
your systems and the personal data they process.

Whatever you do, you should remember the following:
® your cybersecurity measures need to be appropriate to the size and use of your network and information

systems;

@ you should take into account the state of technological development, but you are also able to consider
the costs of implementation;

® your security must be appropriate to your business practices. For example, if you offer staff the ability to
work from home, you need to put measures in place to ensure that this does not compromise your
security; and

® your measures must be appropriate to the nature of the personal data you hold and the harm that might
result from any compromise.

A good starting point is to make sure that you’re in line with the requirements of Cyber Essentials - a
government scheme that includes a set of basic technical controls you can put in place relatively easily.

673


--- New Page 235 ---
Page number: 235
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You should however be aware that you may have to go beyond these requirements, depending on your
processing activities. Cyber Essentials is only intended to provide a ‘base’ set of controls, and won’t address
the circumstances of every organisation or the risks posed by every processing operation.

What if we operate in a sector that has its own security requirements?

Some industries have specific security requirements or require you to adhere to certain frameworks or
standards. These may be set collectively, for example by industry bodies or trade associations, or could be
set by other regulators. If you operate in these sectors, you need to be aware of their requirements,
particularly if specific technical measures are specified.

Although following these requirements will not necessarily equate to compliance with the UK GDPR’s
security principle, the ICO will nevertheless consider these carefully in any considerations of regulatory
action. It can be the case that they specify certain measures that you should have, and that those
measures contribute to your overall security posture.

Example

Data Security Standard @. The PCI-DSS outlines a number of specific technical and organisational
measures that the payment card industry considers applicable whenever such data is being processed.

 

Although compliance with the PCI-DSS is not necessarily equivalent to compliance with the UK GDPR’s

security principle, if you process card data and suffer a personal data breach, the ICO will consider the
extent to which you have put in place measures that PCI-DSS requires particularly if the breach related
to a lack of a particular control or process mandated by the standard.

What do we do when a processor is involved?

If one or more organisations process personal data on your behalf, then these are data processors under
the UK GDPR. This can have the potential to cause security problems —- as a data controller you are
responsible for ensuring compliance with the UK GDPR and this includes what the processor does with the
data. However, in addition to this, the UK GDPR’s security requirements also apply to any processor you
use.

This means that:

@ you must choose a data processor that provides sufficient guarantees about its security measures;

@ your written contract must stipulate that the processor takes all measures required under Article 32 -
basically, the contract has to require the processor to undertake the same security measures that you
would have to take if you were doing the processing yourself; and

@ you should ensure that your contract includes a requirement that the processor makes available all
information necessary to demonstrate compliance. This may include allowing for you to audit and
inspect the processor, either yourself or an authorised third party.

At the same time, your processor can assist you in ensuring compliance with your security obligations. For
example, if you lack the resource or technical expertise to implement certain measures, engaging a
processor that has these resources can assist you in making sure personal data is processed securely,
provided that your contractual arrangements are appropriate.

Should we use pseudonymisation and encryption?

Pseudonymisation and encryption are specified in the UK GDPR as two examples of measures that may be
appropriate for you to implement. This does not mean that you are obliged to use these measures. It
depends on the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing, and the risks posed to individuals.

However, there are a wide range of solutions that allow you to implement both without great cost or
difficulty. For example, for a number of years the ICO has considered encryption to be an appropriate
technical measure given its widespread availability and relatively low cost of implementation. This position
has not altered due to the UK GDPR — if you are storing personal data, or transmitting it over the internet,
we recommend that you use encryption and have a suitable policy in place, taking account of the residual
risks involved.

When considering what to put in place, you should undertake a risk analysis and document your findings.

Detailed guidance on encryption

 

What are ‘confidentiality, integrity, availability’ and ‘resilience’?

Collectively known as the ‘CIA triad’, confidentiality, integrity and availability are the three key elements of
information security. If any of the three elements is compromised, then there can be serious consequences,
both for you as a data controller, and for the individuals whose data you process.

The information security measures you implement should seek to guarantee all three both for the systems
themselves and any data they process.

The CIA triad has existed for a number of years and its concepts are well-known to security professionals.

You are also required to have the ability to ensure the ‘resilience’ of your processing systems and services.
Resilience refers to:

676


--- New Page 238 ---
Page number: 238
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ whether your systems can continue operating under adverse conditions, such as those that may result
from a physical or technical incident; and

e your ability to restore them to an effective state.

This refers to things like business continuity plans, disaster recovery, and cyber resilience. Again, there is a
wide range of solutions available here, and what is appropriate for you depends on your circumstances.

Further Reading

Kr Relevant provisions in the UK GDPR - See Article 32(1)(b) and Recital 83 @

What are the requirements for restoring availability and access to personal data?

You must have the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in the event of a physical or
technical incident in a ‘timely manner’.

The UK GDPR does not define what a ‘timely manner’ should be. This therefore depends on:

@ who you are;
@ what systems you have; and

e the risk that may be posed to individuals if the personal data you process is unavailable for a period of
time.

The key point is that you have taken this into account during your information risk assessment and
selection of security measures. For example, by ensuring that you have an appropriate backup process in
place you will have some level of assurance that if your systems do suffer a physical or technical incident
you can restore them, and therefore the personal data they hold, as soon as reasonably possible.

Example

An organisation takes regular backups of its systems and the personal data held within them. It follows
the well-known ‘3-2-1’ backup strategy: three copies, with two stored on different devices and one
stored off-site.

The organisation is targeted by a ransomware attack that results in the data being encrypted. This
means that it is no longer able to access the personal data it holds.

Depending on the nature of the organisation and the data it processes, this lack of availability can have
significant consequences on individuals - and would therefore be a personal data breach under the
UK GDPR.

The ransomware has spread throughout the organisation’s systems, meaning that two of the backups
are also unavailable. However, the third backup, being stored off-site, allows the organisation to restore
its systems in a timely manner. There may still be a loss of personal data depending on when the
off-site backup was taken, but having the ability to restore the systems means that whilst there will be

677

some disruption to the service, the organisation are nevertheless able to comply with this requirement
of the UK GDPR.

Are we required to ensure our security measures are effective?

Yes, the UK GDPR specifically requires you to have a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating
the effectiveness of any measures you put in place. What these tests look like, and how regularly you do
them, will depend on your own circumstances. However, it’s important to note that the requirement in the
UK GDPR concerns your measures in their entirety, therefore whatever ‘scope’ you choose for this testing
should be appropriate to what you are doing, how you are doing it, and the data that you are processing.

Technically, you can undertake this through a number of techniques, such as vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing. These are essentially ‘stress tests’ of your network and information systems, which are
designed to reveal areas of potential risk and things that you can improve.

In some industries, you are required to undertake tests of security measures on a regular basis. The UK
GDPR now makes this an obligation for all organisations. Importantly, it does not specify the type of
testing, nor how regularly you should undertake it. It depends on your organisation and the personal data
you are processing.

You can undertake testing internally or externally. In some cases it is recommended that both take place.

Whatever form of testing you undertake, you should document the results and make sure that you act upon
any recommendations, or have a valid reason for not doing so, and implement appropriate safeguards. This
is particularly important if your testing reveals potential critical flaws that could result in a personal data
breach.

What about codes of conduct and certification?

If your security measures include a product or service that adheres to a UK GDPR code of conduct or
certification scheme, you may be able to use this as an element to demonstrate your compliance with the
security principle. It is important that you check carefully that the code or certification scheme has been
approved by the ICO.

What about our staff?

The GDPR requires you to ensure that anyone acting under your authority with access to personal data
does not process that data unless you have instructed them to do so. It is therefore vital that your staff
understand the importance of protecting personal data, are familiar with your security policy and put its
procedures into practice.

You should provide appropriate initial and refresher training, including:

® your responsibilities as a data controller under the UK GDPR;

e staff responsibilities for protecting personal data — including the possibility that they may commit
criminal offences if they deliberately try to access or disclose these data without authority;

@ the proper procedures to identify callers;

e the dangers of people trying to obtain personal data by deception (eg by pretending to be the individual
whom the data concerns, or enabling staff to recognise ‘phishing’ attacks), or by persuading your staff
to alter information when they should not do so; and

@ any restrictions you place on the personal use of your systems by staff (eg to avoid virus infection or
spam).

At a glance

e The UK GDPR requires you to process personal data securely using appropriate technical and
organisational measures.

@ What’s appropriate for you will depend not just on your circumstances, but also the data you are
processing and the risks posed.

@ You must assess your information security risk and implement appropriate technical controls.

e The Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have worked
together to develop an approach that you can use when making this assessment.

e It allows you to consider common expectations and either follow existing guidance, use particular
services or develop your own processes if you have appropriate knowledge and resources to do so.

e detecting security events; and

@ minimising the impact.

What does the UK GDPR say about security?

The UK GDPR requires you to process personal data securely. Article 5(1)(f) concerns ‘integrity and
confidentiality’ of personal data - in short, it is the GDPR’s ‘security principle’. It states that personal data
shall be:

681


--- New Page 243 ---
Page number: 243
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

66

‘processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures’

The aim of this guidance is to describe an overall set of outcomes that are considered ‘appropriate’ to
prevent personal data being accidentally or deliberately compromised.

@ Security

What are the other requirements?

Alongside the security principle, the UK GDPR contains other relevant requirements, including data
protection by design in Article 25 and security of processing in Article 32.

Data protection by design requires you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures
designed to implement the data protection principles effectively and integrate necessary safeguards into
the processing. You have to do this at the time of the determination of the means of the processing (ie the
design phase of any processing operation) and at the time of the processing itself.

You also have specific security obligations under Article 32 which apply whether you are a controller or a
processor. These require you to put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an
appropriate level of security of both the processing and your processing environment.

These provisions cover fundamental information security concepts including:

@ minimisation of personal data collected;
@ managing, limiting and controlling access to personal data;
® protecting the classic ‘CIA triad’ (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) of personal data;

@ resilience of processing systems and services, and the ability to restore availability and access to
personal data; and

e@ regular testing of the effectiveness of measures implemented.

The measures you implement should be appropriate to the risk presented.

@ Security

How does security relate to the UK GDPR’s accountability principle and our responsibility as
data controllers?

The accountability principle requires you to be able to demonstrate that your processing is done in
compliance with the UK GDPR. Accountability also has direct relevance to your responsibility as a data
controller.

You are required to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure, and be able to
demonstrate, that processing of personal data is performed in accordance with the UK GDPR.

e Accountability and governance

What are ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’?

The UK GDPR requires you to have a level of security that is ‘appropriate’ to the risks presented by your
processing. You need to consider this in relation to the state of the art and costs of implementation, as well
as the nature, scope, context and purpose of your processing. This reflects both the UK GDPR’s risk-based
approach, and that there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to information security.

This means that what’s ‘appropriate’ for you will depend on your own circumstances, the processing you’re
doing, and the risks it presents to your organisation.

This guidance sets out a set of security outcomes that could form the basis of describing ‘appropriate
technical and organisational measures’ to protect personal data. Whilst there are minimum expectations,
the precise implementation of any measures must be appropriate to the risks you face.

Why ‘security outcomes’?

It may seem like there is a lot of confusion as to the technical security required to comply with your data
protection obligations. There is lots of detailed guidance available, but it may not be immediately clear what
you must put in place, what is simply a suggested approach and what is relevant to you and your
circumstances.

The outcomes intend to provide a common set of expectations that you can meet, either through following
existing guidance, using particular services or, if you are sufficiently competent, development of your own
bespoke approach.

An outcomes-based approach also enables scaling to any size or complexity of organisation or data
processing operation. The outcomes remain constant — it is how they are implemented that differs.

includes representatives from the data protection authorities of each EU member state. It adopts
guidelines for complying with the requirements of EU version of the GDPR.

WP29 published guidelines on Data Protection Officers @, which the EDPB endorsed in May 2018.

 

A.2 Risk management

You take appropriate steps to identify, assess and understand security risks to personal data and the
systems that process this data.

The UK GDPR emphasises a risk-based approach to data protection and the security of your processing
systems and services. You must take steps to assess these risks and include appropriate organisational
measures to make effective risk-based decisions based upon:

@ the state of the art (of technology);

@ the cost of implementation;

e the nature, scope, context and purpose of processing; and

e@ the severity and likelihood of the risk(s).

Beyond this, where the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals,
you must also undertake a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to determine the impact of the
intended processing on the protection of personal data. The DPIA should consider the technical and
organisational measures necessary to mitigate that risk. Where such measures do not reduce the risk to an

acceptable level, you need to have a process in place to consult with the ICO before you start the
processing.

Steps to Cyber Security is about developing an information risk management regime.

A.3 Asset management

You understand and catalogue the personal data you process and can describe the purpose for processing
it. You also understand the risks posed to individuals of any unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental
loss, destruction or damage to that data.

The personal data you process should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the
purpose of the processing, and it should not be kept for longer than is necessary.

A.4 Processors and the supply chain

You understand and manage security risks to your processing operations that may arise as a result of using
third parties such as data processors. This includes ensuring that they employ appropriate security
measures.

In the case of data processors, you are required to choose those that provide sufficient guarantees about
their technical and organisational measures. The UK GDPR includes provisions where processors are used,
including specific stipulations that must feature in your contract.

B. Protect personal data against cyber-attack
You have proportionate security measures in place to protect against cyber-attack which cover:

e@ the personal data you process; and

@ the systems that process such data.
B.1 Service protection policies and processes

You should define, implement, communicate and enforce appropriate policies and processes that direct your
overall approach to securing systems involved in the processing of personal data.

You should also consider assessing your systems and implementing specific technical controls as laid out in
appropriate frameworks (such as Cyber Essentials).
Other resources

Homepage of the Cyber Essentials schemes at the NCSC’s website.

 

B.2 Identity and access control

You understand, document and manage access to personal data and systems that process this data. Access
rights granted to specific users must be understood, limited to those users who reasonably need such
access to perform their function and removed when no longer needed. You should undertake activities to
check or validate that the technical system permissions are consistent with your documented user access
rights.

You should appropriately authenticate and authorise users (or any automated functions) that can access
personal data. You should strongly authenticate users who have privileged access and consider two-factor
or hardware authentication measures.

You should prevent users from downloading, transferring, altering or deleting personal data where there is
no legitimate organisational reason to do so. You should appropriately constrain legitimate access and
ensure there is an appropriate audit trail.

You should have a robust password policy which avoids users having weak passwords, such as those
trivially guessable. You should change all default passwords and remove or suspend unused accounts.

B.3 Data security

You implement technical controls (such as appropriate encryption) to prevent unauthorised or unlawful
processing of personal data, whether through unauthorised access to user devices or storage media,
backups, interception of data in transit or at rest or accessing data that might remain in memory when
technology is sent for repair or disposal.

B.4 System security

You implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect systems, technologies and
digital services that process personal data from cyber-attack.

Whilst the UK GDPR requires a risk-based approach, typical examples of security measures you could take

688


--- New Page 250 ---
Page number: 250
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

include:
® tracking and recording all assets that process personal data, including end user devices and removable
media;

®@ minimising the opportunity for attack by configuring technology appropriately, minimising available
services and controlling connectivity;

® actively managing software vulnerabilities, including using in-support software and the application of
software update policies (patching), and taking other mitigating steps, where patches can’t be applied;

@ managing end user devices (laptops and smartphones etc.) so that you can apply organisational controls
over software or applications that interact with or access personal data;

® encrypting personal data at rest on devices (laptops, smartphones, removable media) that are not
subject to strong physical controls;

® encrypting personal data when transmitted electronically;

@ ensuring that web services are protected from common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and
others described in widely-used publications such as the OWASP Top 10; and

® ensuring your processing environment remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

You also undertake regular testing to evaluate the effectiveness of your security measures, including virus
and malware scanning, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing as appropriate. You record the results
of any testing and remediating action plans.

Whatever security measures you put in place - whether these are your own, or whether you use a third
party service such as a cloud provider - you remain responsible both for the processing itself, and also in
respect of any devices that you operate.

Passwords in online services

At a glance

e Although the UK GDPR does not say anything specific about passwords, you are required to process
personal data securely by means of appropriate technical and organisational measures.

e Passwords are a commonly-used means of protecting access to systems that process personal data.
Therefore, any password setup that you implement must be appropriate to the particular circumstances
of this processing.

@ You should consider whether there are any better alternatives to using passwords.

e Any password system you deploy must protect against theft of stored passwords and ‘brute-force’ or
guessing attacks.

e@ There are a number of additional considerations you will need to take account of when designing your
password system, such as the use of an appropriate hashing algorithm to store your passwords,
protecting the means by which users enter their passwords, defending against common attacks and the
use of two-factor authentication.

In brief

@ What is this guidance about?

@ What is required under the UK GDPR?

@ What else do we need to do?

@ What are the challenges in choosing the right authentication scheme?
@ Are passwords the best choice?

@ What makes a secure and useable password system?

@ What should we consider when implementing a password system?
@ How should we store passwords?

@ What requirements should we set for user passwords?

@ What should we do about password expirations and resets?

@ What defences can we put in place against attacks?

@ What else do we need to consider?

What is this guidance about?

This guidance is intended for use when you want to implement a password-based authentication scheme
for an online service. It outlines the considerations that you should have where your authentication scheme
will be protecting access to personal data.

Using passwords or other credentials for your internal network and information systems are out of scope of
this guidance. However, there may be content that applies in this context all the same.

Before reading and applying this guidance, you should consider whether passwords are the most
appropriate method of authenticating users, or whether other alternatives will provide more security and
less friction for users.

What is required under the UK GDPR?

The UK GDPR does not say anything specific about passwords. However, Article 5(1)(f) states that personal
data shall be:

66

‘Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
appropriate technical or organisational measures’

This is the UK GDPR’s ‘integrity and confidentiality’ principle, or, more simply, the ‘security’ principle. So,
although there are no provisions on passwords, the security principle requires you to take appropriate
technical and organisational measures to prevent unauthorised processing of personal data you hold.

This means that when you are considering a password setup to protect access to a system that processes
personal data, that setup must be ‘appropriate’.

Although the UK GDPR does not define what is ‘appropriate’, it does provide further considerations in Article
32, ‘security of processing’:

66

‘Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.’

This means that when considering any measures, you can consider the state of technological development
and the cost of implementation - but the measures themselves must ensure a level of security appropriate
to the nature of the data being protected and the harm that could be caused by unauthorised access.

In other words, you cannot simply set up a password system and then forget about it —- there must be a
periodic review process.

What else do we need to do?

You must ensure that you are aware of the state of technological development in this area and that your
processes and technologies are robust against evolving threats.

For example, advances in processing power can reduce the effectiveness of cryptography or particular

694


--- New Page 256 ---
Page number: 256
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

design choices can become outdated.

You must also consider whether there might be better alternatives to passwords that can be used to secure
a system.

Article 25 of the UK GDPR also requires you to adopt a data protection by design approach. This means that
whenever you develop systems and services that are involved in your processing, you should ensure that
you take account of data protection considerations at the initial design stage and throughout the lifecycle.
This applies to any password system you intend to use.

At the same time, provided you properly implement a password system, it can be an element that can be
used to demonstrate compliance with your obligations under data protection by design.

What are the challenges in choosing the right authentication scheme?

One of the biggest challenges you face when dealing with personal data online is ensuring that such data
can be accessed only by those with the correct permissions - in other words, authenticating, and
authorising, the individual who is trying to gain access.

It is commonly accepted that there are three main ways of authenticating people to a system —- checking
for:

@ something the individual has (such as a smart card);
@ something the individual is (this is usually a biometric measure, such as a fingerprint); or

@ something the individual knows.

Of these, the most commonly used is something the individual knows. In most cases something they know
is taken to be a password.

Passwords remain the most popular way that individuals authenticate to online services. The reason for this
is that a password is generally the simplest method to deploy and the most familiar for individuals.

Despite this, passwords carry well-known risks. The biggest risk is that people passwords as a
mathematical problem that can be solved by increasing complexity rules. This fails to take into account

695


--- New Page 257 ---
Page number: 257
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

natural human behaviour which is to make passwords more easily memorable, regardless of the cost to
security.

A rigid focus on password strength rules with no consideration of the usual behaviour of people choosing
passwords means that you can make inappropriate choices in setting up and maintaining of your
authentication system. This could place the wider security of your systems or your users at risk, and could
lead to unauthorised or unlawful access to personal data.

Are passwords the best choice?

The success of using a password to properly authenticate a user of your service relies on the fact that their
password remains a shared secret between you and them. When a password is shared amongst users or
can be easily guessed by an attacker it can become extremely difficult to tell the difference between an
authorised user and an imposter with stolen or guessed credentials.

The proliferation of online services requiring individuals to create an account has created a risk that people
become overwhelmed with access credentials and default to reusing a short and memorable password
(often coupled with the same email address as a username) across multiple websites.

The risk here is that if one service suffers a personal data breach and access credentials are compromised,
these can be tested against other online services to gain access — a technique known as ‘credential
stuffing’.

Example

In 2012, the social networking site LinkedIn was hacked. It was thought at the time that passwords for
around 6.5 million user accounts were stolen by cybercriminals. However, in May 2016, following the
confirmed that the 2012 attack had actually resulted in the theft of email addresses and hashed
passwords of approximately 165 million users @.

 

 

The vast majority of the passwords were subsequently cracked and posted online less than a day after
the further distribution, largely due to the use of SHA1 without a salt as the hashing algorithm. Due to
the reuse of passwords across online services, a number of subsequent account takeovers at other
services were attributed to the LinkedIn hack.

Before designing and implementing a new password system, you should consider whether it is necessary to
do so, or whether there is a better alternative that can provide secure access.

One common alternative to building your own solution is to utilise a single sign on (SSO) system. While this
has its advantages (not least a reduction in the number of passwords that a user has to remember) you
must ensure that you are happy with the level of security that is offered by that system. You should ensure
that you have a documented record of the considerations you made when reaching this decision.

You must also consider what will happen if the SSO is compromised, as this will most likely result in your
user’s accounts also being compromised.

What makes a secure and useable password system?

A good password system is one that provides you with sufficient assurance that the individual attempting to
log in is the user they claim to be. In practice, this means a good password system should protect against
two types of attack:

e firstly, it should be as difficult as possible for attackers to access stored passwords in a useable form;
and

@ secondly, it should protect against attackers trying to brute force or guess a valid password and
username combination.

Your system should also make it as easy as possible for users to create secure and unique passwords that
they can remember or store easily. It should not place an undue burden on individuals to make sure that
their account is secure. Putting such barriers in place can result in users making less secure password
choices.

The advice provided in this guidance is a good starting point for most systems where personal data is being
protected. It will be updated as necessary, but you should consider whether you need to apply a higher
level of security given your particular circumstances.

This will largely depend on the nature, scope, context and purposes of your processing and the risks it
poses. However, in essence, the more serious the consequences of a compromise, the higher the level of
security that you will require.

You should ensure that you stay up to date with the current capabilities of attackers who might try to

If you are going to put in place a password system, you should take account of factors like:

@ how you will process user passwords;

e@ how your users enter their passwords;

e the requirements you set for user passwords;

@ what you do about password expirations and resets;
e the defences you put in place against attacks; and

@ any additional considerations.

How should we store passwords?

Do not store passwords in plaintext - make sure you use a suitable hashing algorithm, or another
mechanism that offers an equivalent level of protection against an attacker deriving the original password.

Well-known hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA1 are not suitable for hashing passwords. Both
algorithms have known security weaknesses which can be exploited, and you should not use these for
password protection in any circumstances. The biggest weakness with these algorithms is the speed that
hashes can be calculated.

You should also consider avoiding other fast algorithms. Use a hashing algorithm that has been specifically
designed for passwords, such as bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2, with a salt of appropriate length.

It is important that you review the hashing algorithms you use, as over time they can become outdated.
Guidance on algorithms is available from a number of organisations such as the NCSC @, the National
Institute of Standards in Technology @ (NIST) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity @
(ENISA). You should also be aware of any sector-specific guidelines that are available and may be
applicable to you.

 

 

 

You should make sure that you can replace any algorithm that becomes obsolete.

You should also ensure that the architecture around your password system does not allow for any
inadvertent leaking of passwords in plaintext.

Example

In 2018, Twitter and GitHub discovered that errors in their logging systems had led to plaintext
passwords for users being stored in log files. Although the log files were not exposed to anyone outside
of the organisations, both Twitter and GitHub recommended or required that users changed their
passwords.

ECRYPT-CSA’s 2018 ‘Algorithms, key size and protocols @’ report (external link, PDF) provides further
information on the status of cryptographic hash functions.

 

How should our users enter their passwords?

You should ensure that your login pages are protected with HTTPS, or some other equivalent level of
protection. Failure to do so will mean that anyone who is in a position to intercept network traffic can obtain
passwords and may be able to carry out replay attacks. You should also consider that browsers now mark
pages that require secure input (such as login pages) as insecure if they are delivered over HTTP, and many
browsers now mark all pages delivered over HTTP as insecure.

Further reading

Make sure that password hashing is carried out server-side, rather than client-side. Hashing client-side will
remove the protection afforded by hashing in the first place, unless other mitigations are put in place. This
is a complicated area with a number of factors to consider. At the most basic level, if you are hashing
client-side and an attacker obtains your password database, then those hashes can be presented directly to
the server for a successful login.

Also, you should not prevent users from pasting passwords into the password field. Preventing pasting is
often seen as a security measure, but at the same time doing so can impede people from using password

defended against with proper rate limiting (see below for more details on rate limiting).

 

Other resources

Read the NCSC’s ‘Let them paste passwords’ @ blog post for more information on why you should allow
your users to paste passwords into password fields.

 

What requirements should we set for user passwords?

There are three general requirements for any password system that you will need to consider:

® password length - you should set a suitable minimum password length (this should be no less than 10
characters), but not a maximum length. If you are correctly hashing your passwords, then the output

699


--- New Page 261 ---
Page number: 261
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

should be the same length for every password, and therefore the only limit to password length should
be the way your website is coded. If you absolutely must set a maximum length due to the limitations of
your website code, then tell users what it is before they try to enter a password. The reasoning behind
having a maximum length should be documented and fully risk assessed;

@ special characters - you should allow the use of special characters, but don’t mandate it. If you must
disallow special characters (or spaces) make sure this is made clear before the user creates their
password; and

® password ‘deny lists’ - do not allow your users to use a common, weak password. Screen passwords
against a password ‘deny list’ of the most commonly used passwords, leaked passwords from website
breaches and common words or phrases that relate to the service. Update this list at least yearly.
Explain to users that this is what you are doing, and that this is why a password has been rejected.

Example

 

Other than the three requirements listed above, do not set restrictions on how users should create a
password. Research (see ‘Other resources’ below) indicates that doing so will cause people to reuse
passwords across accounts, to create weak passwords with obvious substitutions or to forget their
passwords. All this places unnecessary stress on your reset process and weakens the overall security of
your service.

Properly set up and configured password strength meters can be a good way to easily communicate the
requirements listed above to your users, and research has shown that good meters can assist users in
choosing strong passwords. If you decide to use one, make sure it properly reflects what constitutes a
strong or weak password.

number of common password attacks and highlights a number of issues including the risks of placing
restrictions on how users create passwords.

Finally, remind your users that they should not reuse passwords from other services. In most circumstances
you should not know what your user’s passwords are. However, some companies actively track
compromised credentials that are traded on the dark web and will check these credentials against the
hashes they hold on their systems to see if there is a match.

If you decide that this is something you want to do you need to carefully consider the potential legal
implications of obtaining such lists, and you will need to explain very clearly how you use that data to your
users (especially where the use of such data has led to a password reset or an account lockout).

If users receive an email asking them to reset their password without a proper explanation they will
generally assume that the problem is with your service, so it is in your interests to explain precisely why
you are taking this action.

What should we do about password expirations and resets?

You should only set password expirations if they are absolutely necessary for your particular circumstances.
Regular expiry often causes people to change a single strong password for a series of weak passwords.

As a general rule, get your users to create a strong initial password and only change them if there are
pressing reasons, such as a breach of your systems that may have resulted in the password hashes being
compromised, or if you receive some other indication that a user’s password may have been compromised.

When deploying a password reset process you should ensure that it is secure. Do not send passwords over
email, even if they are temporary — use one time links, and ensure that you do not leak the credentials in
any referral headers.

You should also not be in a position where a member of your staff is able to ‘read out’ a user’s password to
them, eg over the phone in a service call—this indicates that you are storing passwords in plaintext, which
is, as described above, not appropriate. If you require a password to validate a user over the phone, set a

separate phone password for the account.

You should also time limit any password reset credentials. The majority of users will probably reset their
password immediately, but set a limit that fits your observed user behaviour.

(external link).

 

What defences can we put in place against attacks?

Ensure that you are rate limiting or ‘throttling’ the number and frequency of incorrect login attempts. The
precise number of attempts and the consequence of exceeding these limits will be for you to decide based
on the specific circumstances of your organisation, but limiting to a certain number per hour, day and
month is a good idea.

This will help to deter both bulk attackers and people targeting individual accounts.

701


--- New Page 263 ---
Page number: 263
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

failed attempts on a single account unless otherwise specified in the system being deployed.

There are additional considerations when implementing your rate limits:

@ you should be aware that some attackers will deliberately work within your limits to avoid detection, and
will still achieve a reasonable success rate, especially with targeted guessing;

e@ set your limits based on observed behaviour of both attackers and your users;

@ be aware that overly-aggressive rate limiting can be used as a denial of service attack (remember that
the UK GDPR requires the availability of personal data); and

@ remember that a number of successful or unsuccessful access attempts to a range of different user
accounts from the same device or IP address might be indicative of a bulk attack.

You should also consider whether other methods of preventing attacks might be appropriate. Examples of
these methods could include, but are not limited to:

@ the use of ‘CAPTCHAs’;
@ creating an ‘allow list’ of IP addresses; and

@ time limits or time delays after failed authentications.

What else do we need to consider?

You need to address how your system will respond to an attacker who has legitimate credentials for a user,
or for multiple users. There is a distinct possibility that you will encounter this scenario given that both
password reuse and website breaches are relatively common occurrences.

Techniques for recognising common user behaviour are becoming more advanced, and you could use these
to develop a risk-based approach to verifying an authentication attempt. For example, if a user logs in from
a new device or IP address you might consider requesting a second authentication factor and informing the
user by another contact method of the login attempt.

It is however important to remember that collecting additional data from users in order to defend against
authentication attacks could itself constitute processing personal data and should operate in compliance
with the UK GDPR. This does not mean you cannot process this data, but you must ensure that you have
considered the data protection implications of doing so.

You should consider providing your users with the facility to review a list of unsuccessful login attempts.
This will allow people who might be specifically targeted to check for potential attacks manually. However,
this will only be useful if you pay attention to reports from individuals that their accounts are being
attacked.

You should implement two-factor or multifactor authentication wherever it is possible to do so - to take the
most common example, a password and a one-time token generator. This will be more important where the

7062


--- New Page 264 ---
Page number: 264
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

personal data that can be accessed is of a sensitive nature, or could cause significant harm if it were
compromised.

Other examples of a second factor that could be used include biometrics (fingerprints being the most
common and easy to implement), smart cards or U2F keys and devices.

You will however need to ensure that any processing of biometric data for the purposes of uniquely
identifying an individual is done in accordance with the requirements for processing special category data in
both the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

@ Personal data breaches from the ICO’s caseload during 2020/2021 have seen a steady increase in the
number and severity caused by ransomware. This is a type of malicious software or “malware” designed
to block access to computer systems, and the data held within them, using encryption.

@ Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to unlawfully encrypt files on a host computer system.

@ This guidance presents eight scenarios about the most common ransomware compliance issues we have

What is ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malware that attempts to unlawfully encrypt files on a host computer system.

705


--- New Page 267 ---
Page number: 267
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

A ransomware attack occurs when an attacker gains access to an organisation’s computer systems and
delivers malicious software into the network. This software, or ‘payload,’ then makes the data unavailable
through encryption or deletion. Ransomware is often designed to spread from device to device to maximise
the number of files it can encrypt.

The ‘ransom’ element comes from the ransom note left by the attacker requesting payment in return for
restoring the data. This is usually done by a decryption key that only the attacker can access.

Where personal data is encrypted as the result of a ransomware attack, that constitutes a personal data
breach because you have lost timely access to the data.

Unless you have a backup of the data, you will not usually be able to recover it unless you decide to comply
with the attacker’s demand for payment. Even if you decide to pay the ransom fee, there is no guarantee
that the attacker will supply the key to allow you to decrypt the files.

Why is ransomware an important data protection topic?

In recent years, ransomware attacks are one of the most common cyber incidents affecting personal data.
The attack can lead to the loss of timely access to personal data. Permanent data loss can also occur, if
appropriate backups are not in place.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recognises ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the
United Kingdom. The most recent threat landscape report from the European Union Agency for Cyber
Security (ENISA) has also assessed ransomware as the prime threat with cybercriminals increasingly
motivated by monetisation.

The attacks are becoming increasingly damaging and this trend is likely to continue. Malicious and criminal
actors are finding new ways to pressure organisations to pay. For example, through uploading a copy of
your data and threatening to publish it.

As criminal actors look for additional ways to exploit the captured data, the risks to individuals have
increased, including:

@ potential permanent personal data loss;

@ potential loss of control over their personal data;

@ being further targeted in social engineering style attacks using the breached data (eg phishing emails);
and

e@ their personal data being further maliciously used by criminal actors (eg to facilitate identify and
financial fraud).

Sectors such as education, health, legal services and business are amongst the most targeted. However, all
UK businesses that process personal data are at risk. This is due to the low barriers to entry, such as by
using ransomware-as-a-service and opportunistic attacks.

What can we do to prevent ransomware?

You should review our checklist above, as well as the following eight scenarios. These are the eight most
common ransomware compliance issues we have identified, based on past personal data breaches.

706

Scenario 1: Attacker sophistication

I am a small organisation that is aware of the growing threat of ransomware. However, I don’t think
attackers will be interested in targeting me. If they do, how can I protect the personal data I process?

‘Scatter gun’ style attacks are a common attack method. This is a type of attack that is indiscriminate and
does not have a specific target. For example, the attacker may send thousands of phishing emails
attempting to deliver ransomware to at least one victim, whoever that may be.

The NCSC Cyber Essentials @ is designed to support you in preventing basic and common types of attacks.
The measures they describe will help you apply appropriate security measures, which are a requirement of
the UK GDPR.

 

For medium and larger organisations, maintaining good cyber security practices is essential to defend
against ransomware attacks. Assessing your cyber security arrangements and capabilities against relevant
good practice models can support you protect personal data from the threat of ransomware, such as:

@ NCSC 10 Steps to Cyber Security; @
@ 1SO27001 for Information Security @; and
@ NIST Cyber Security Framework @.

The NCSC Mitigating Malware and Ransomware attacks @ also provides specific guidance that can support
you in preventing such attacks.

 

Scenario 2: Personal data breach

We have been subjected to a ransomware attack, but personal data has not been uploaded from our
systems to the attacker. If the data has not been removed does this mean a personal data breach has
not occurred?

If you are subject to a cyber-attack, such as ransomware, you are responsible for determining if the
incident has led to a personal data breach. This is your first step in deciding if you should notify the ICO
about the incident.

The UK GDPR defines a personal data breach as “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or
otherwise processed”.

Where personal data is taken it typically results in unauthorised disclosure or access to personal data and
therefore is a type of personal data breach. However, it is not the only consideration you should make when
determining if a personal data breach has occurred.

707


--- New Page 269 ---
Page number: 269
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

You may have lost timely access to the personal data, for example because the data has been encrypted.
This is a type of personal data breach because you have lost “access to” personal data. Temporary loss of
access is also a type of personal data breach. For example, if there is a period of time before you restore
from backup.

Therefore, loss of access to personal data is as much of a personal data breach as a loss of confidentiality.

However, just because a personal data breach has occurred does not automatically mean you should notify
the ICO. Scenario 3 deals with a common breach notification scenario.

Scenario 3: Breach notification

We have established a personal data breach has occurred, but data has not been exfiltrated, therefore
there are no risk to individuals. Do we still need to notify the ICO?

You are required to notify the ICO of a personal data breach without undue delay and no later than 72
hours after having become aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and
freedoms of individuals.

This means once you have established a personal data breach has occurred, you should undertake a formal
risk assessment. This is to determine the risks to individuals and the likelihood of such risks occurring. If
you determine the risks to be unlikely, you do not need to notify the ICO. However, you must keep a record
of any personal data breaches, regardless of whether you are required to notify, together with the risk
assessment undertaken.

Where data is uploaded from your systems to the attacker it can increase the risks to individuals.

Therefore, you should take data exfiltration into account as part of your risk considerations. Appropriate
logging can support you in determining if personal data is likely to have been exfiltrated. The NCSC blog
post “What exactly should we be logging @” can support you in deciding what logs to collect and retain.

 

Without appropriate logs you may not generate the evidence to allow you to make an informed decision. If
you determine there is no evidence of data exfiltration, the ICO may ask you to demonstrate what logs and
measures you used to make this decision.

However, whilst exfiltration is an important consideration it is not the only one you should make. You should
consider the rights and freedoms of individuals in totality. For example:

@ Does the lack of availability impact on any individual rights, such as right of access to the personal data?
@ Have individuals lost control of their personal data?

@ Can you restore the personal data in a timely manner? If not, what does this mean for individuals?

e To what degree was the personal data exposed to unauthorised actors and what are their likely
motivations?

@ How confident are you in your detection and monitoring controls —- could you have detected personal
data being uploaded if it had occurred? If you do not have appropriate logs to make an informed
decision, it may be helpful to determine if the attacker had the means, motivation and opportunity to

exfiltrate the data. You can then use this assessment to make a risk-based decision.

breaches.

 

Our guidance on personal data breaches can also further support you in assessing reportable personal
data breaches.

 

Scenario 4: Law enforcement

A ransomware attack has breached the personal data we process. We are planning to notify individuals,
however, law enforcement are currently collecting evidence as this was a criminal attack. They have
requested we delay notifying individuals until they has completed this. How do I comply with my GDPR
obligations whilst also cooperating with law enforcement?

If you have been subjected to a ransomware attack it is recommended you should contact law
enforcement.

Law enforcement play a fundamental role in protecting individuals and the ICO work closely with these
agencies in providing a multi-agency response to ransomware. Recitals 86 and 88 of the UK GDPR provide
direction should law enforcement recommend delaying data subject notification:

Recital 86:

Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close
cooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant
authorities such as law-enforcement authorities

Recital 88:

Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of
law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the
circumstances of a personal data breach

However, law enforcement involvement does not automatically mean you should delay notifying individuals.
Should law enforcement request a delay in a public notification, you should work closely with the ICO. This
will allow us to work with you and law enforcement to assess the risk to the individuals under respective
legislation.

Scenario 5: Attacker tactics, techniques and procedures

We have recently seen an increase in phishing emails coming into our organisation and are looking at
what measures we can put in place to mitigate this risk. Are there any other specific attacker tactics
that the ICO commonly see in ransomware attacks?

Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) describe the methods attackers use to compromise data.
Different attacks will use different types of TTPs, for example phishing is a common TTP to trick someone
into giving up their credentials.

However, attacker TTPs are constantly evolving, as described within scenario one of this report. A good
baseline of controls will reduce the likelihood of being exploited by basic levels of attack, such as those
described in the NCSC Cyber Essentials.

world observations. The framework outlines each stage of an attack and the common TTPs that are used.
These are a great resource to support you in identifying if your controls are appropriate to resist known
TTPs.

During 2020/2021, we identified four of the most common TTPs from ransomware casework. The following
practical advice for each example will support you in implementing appropriate measures.

Phishing: Attackers typically use social engineering techniques to trick you into doing something. Phishing
is a common method we've seen to either deliver ransomware by email or to trick you into revealing your
username and password.

Your security strategy should include ensuring all relevant staff receive basic awareness training in

Phishing Attack guidance to your own organisation.

 

Remote access: The most common entry point into a network was by the exploitation of remote access
solutions. Attackers often scan the internet for open ports such as remote desktop protocol and use this as
an initial entry point. If they can capture valid credentials (eg by phishing, password database dumps or
password guessing through brute force), they can authenticate by the remote access solution.

You should risk assess and document your remote access solution and identify appropriate measures in
response to the risks. An access control policy that directs you to the minimum levels of controls required
will support you in applying appropriate measures.

You should not use single-factor authentication on internet facing services, such as remote access, if it can
lead to access to personal data. Use multi-factor authentication, or other comparably secure access

718

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

controls.

The NCSC device security guidance @ provides further advice on designing a remote access architecture for
enterprise services.

 

Privileged account compromise: Once an attacker has a foothold in the network it is common that they
compromise a privileged account, such as a domain administrator account. This is typically done by either

® compromising weak passwords of privileged accounts;
® compromising service accounts that do not belong to a particular user;

@ using well known tools to extract plain text domain administrator passwords, password hashes or
Kerberos tickets from the host; or

@ exploiting a known software or application vulnerability which has a patch available to fix it.

Once an attacker can elevate their privileges to a domain administrative level account they are typically in a
commanding position and will usually deploy the ransomware through the domain controller.

The security of privileged accounts should be a high priority for you. Basic account hygiene can support you
in protecting these accounts, such as:

@ regular reviews of permissions;
@ following the principle of least privilege;
e@ risk assessments of membership into privileged groups; and

@ senior level approval of privileged group membership.

Further reading

The NCSC has a selection of guidance available that can further support you in identifying appropriate
measures to protect privileged accounts.

e How to do secure system administration @

® Protecting system administration with PAM @

Known software or application vulnerabilities: The exploitation of known vulnerabilities where patches
were available to fix the issue is a common method used by attackers. This was much more common than
zero-day attacks where the vulnerability exploited is not yet publicly known and is typically crafted by
advanced levels of attackers. In particular, attackers often scan, sometimes indiscriminately, for known
vulnerabilities present in internet-facing device and services.

The NCSC vulnerability management guidance @ will support you in managing vulnerabilities within your
estate.

 

Considering the following will also support you in managing known vulnerabilities:

e@ Identify the assets within your organisation, including the software and application you use.

@ Define and direct your approach to the patch management lifecycle, including the process of identifying,
assessing, acquiring, testing, deploying and validating patches.

e@ Maintain software and applications that are in support by the vendor.

711

Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ Identify vulnerabilities within your estate for both internal and external hardware and software (eg
vulnerability scanning).

Scenario 6: Disaster recovery

We understand the UK GDPR requires appropriate controls to be able to restore personal data in the
event of a disaster. We currently backup our data so we are able to restore it in the event of a
ransomware attack. Is there anything else we should consider?

A ransomware attack can be amongst the most stressful times for an organisation. Planning for such an
event is critical in ensuring you have the measures in place to be able to appropriately respond to it.

For smaller and medium sized organisations the NCSC Small Business Guide Response and Recovery @
gives you practical advice that will help you plan for dealing with an incident such as a ransomware attack.

 

For larger organisations the NCSC Incident Management guidance within its 10 steps to cyber security @
can support you in implementing appropriate controls.

 

A backup of your personal data is one of the most important controls in mitigating the risk of ransomware.
However, it is common that attackers will attempt to either delete or encrypt your backup. You should
therefore consider if your current backup strategy could be at risk. Performing a threat analysis against
your backup solution and considering how an attacker could delete or encrypt the data is recommended.
The questions below will help you get started in your threat assessment:

e@ Is your backup segregated or offline?

@ What would an attacker need to compromise to gain access to the backup? For example, what accounts
can access the backup? What accounts can perform deletion or edit the backups? How could an attacker
compromise these accounts? How do you protect accounts that can access the backups?

@ Are you able to detect changes to your backup? For example, if an attacker initiated a deletion of your
backup, could you detect this?

@ What device or IP address or both can access the backup repository? Can this be spoofed? Can an
attacker access the device or repository that stores the backup?

@ How would you respond if an attacker deleted or encrypted your backup?

Using your threat analyses will help you identify controls to mitigate the risks. Offline backups that are
completely offline from the main network are one of the most secure ways to prevent attackers from
accessing it. If you are using cloud backups, you should read the NCSC blog posts about protecting these
backups Offline Backups in on online world @ and Cloud Backup options for mitigating the risk of
ransomware @.

 

 

Scenario 7: Ransomware payment

712


--- New Page 274 ---
Page number: 274
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The attacker has provided a ransomware note saying it can restore the data if we pay the ransom fee.
The attacker has also stated that if we pay they will not publish the data, so we are also considering if
this would further reduce risk to individuals.

Does the ICO recommend the payment of the ransom to restore the data and mitigate risks to
individuals?

Before paying the ransom, you should take into account that you are dealing with criminal and malicious
actors. Even if you pay, there is no guarantee that they will provide you with the decryption key. “Double
extortion” is also common, where you pay for the decryption key and the attacker then requires an
additional payment to stop the publication of the data. Attack groups may also target you again in the
future if you have shown willingness to pay.

Law enforcement do not encourage, endorse, nor condone the payment of ransom demands. The ICO
supports this position.

You should also consider the terminology within the UK GDPR. It requires you to implement “appropriate
measures” to restore the data in the event of a disaster. The ICO does not consider the payment of a
ransom as an “appropriate measure” to restore personal data.

Appropriate measures include threat assessments, risk assessments and controls such as offline and
segregated backups. If you can demonstrate appropriate measures in accordance with the state of the art,
cost and risk of processing then you will be able to demonstrate “appropriate measures” and comply with
those aspects of the UK GDPR.

If attackers have exfiltrated the personal data, then you have effectively lost control over that data. This
means individuals have lost the protections and rights provided by the UK GDPR. For example,
transparency of processing or subject access rights. For this reason, we do not view the payment of the
ransom as an effective mitigation measure.

If you do decide to pay the ransom to avoid the data being published, you should still presume that the
data is compromised and take actions accordingly. For example, the attacker may still decide to publish the
data, share the data offline with other attack groups or further exploit it for their own gains. You still need
to consider how you will mitigate the risks to individuals even though you have paid the ransom fee.

Scenario 8: Testing and assessing security controls

I want to protect my organisation and the personal data I process from ransomware. Is there any type
of testing I can do to assess whether my controls are appropriate?

The UK GDPR requires you to regularly test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of your technical and
organisational controls using appropriate measures. There is no one test that you can carry out, you should
consider this within your wider security framework.

For the examples discussed within this review, we have provided several suggested methods which will

713


--- New Page 275 ---
Page number: 275
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

support you in adopting appropriate measures:

e Breach notification: Document and perform regular tests of your incident response plan so you are
prepared for a real incident. The NCSC Exercise in a Box @ tool can help you practice your incident
response in a safe environment.

e Account management: Regularly audit your user accounts to ensure they are still required and
contain the appropriate privileges. This should include reviews to ensure staff have not retained
privileges from previous internal job roles that are no longer required, often called “privilege creep”.
Ensure you document such reviews. Consider controls to identify weak or previously breached
passwords.

e Patch management: Have a method to identify vulnerabilities in your network, such as missing
patches. Vulnerability scans are an effective tool that can support this.

e Attack tactics, techniques and procedure: Risk assess and document your security controls to
determine if they are appropriate to resist known TTPs. Penetration testers often simulate attacker
activity by applying TTPs to vulnerabilities within your environment.

e Audit: Perform and record regular audits of your environment against a proven security standard, such
as Cyber essentials (for smaller organisations) or IS027001 (for medium and larger organisations).

e Disaster recovery: Perform and record regular tests of your disaster recovery plan to ensure it is
effective. For example, perform a restore of personal data to ensure the data can be restored within the
recovery time objective.

As with any tests, reviews, and assessments, ensure you document and appropriately retain these records,
as you may need to submit them to the ICO.

e@ In detail

What does the UK GDPR say about encryption?

e The UK GDPR’s security principle requires to you put in place appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure you process personal data securely.

@ Article 32 provides further considerations for the security of your processing. This includes specifying
encryption as an example of an appropriate technical measure, depending on the risks involved and the
specific circumstances of your processing. The ICO has seen numerous incidents of personal data being
subject to unauthorised or unlawful processing, loss, damage or destruction. In many cases, the
damage and distress caused by these incidents may have been reduced or even avoided had the
personal data been encrypted.

@ It is also the case that encryption solutions are widely available and can be deployed at relatively low
cost.

e It is possible that, where data is lost or destroyed and it was not encrypted, regulatory action may be
pursued (depending on the context of each incident).

What is encryption?

@ Encryption is a mathematical function that encodes data in such a way that only authorised users can
access it.

e@ It is a way of safeguarding against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data, and is one way
in which you can demonstrate compliance with the security principle.

e@ Encryption protects information stored on mobile and static devices and in transmission, and there are a
number of different encryption options available.

@ You should consider encryption alongside other technical and organisational measures, taking into
account the benefits it can offer and the risks it can pose.

@ You should have a policy in place governing the use of encryption, including appropriate staff education.

@ You should also be aware of any sector-specific guidance that applies to you, as this may require you to
use encryption.

Encryption and data storage

e Encrypting data whilst it is being stored provides effective protection against unauthorised or unlawful
processing.

e Most modern operating systems have full-disk encryption built-in.

@ You can also encrypt individual files or create encrypted containers.

716


--- New Page 278 ---
Page number: 278
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ Some applications and databases can be configured to store data in encrypted form.

e Storing encrypted data still poses residual risks. You will need to address these depending on the
context of your processing, such as by means of an organisational policy and staff training

Encryption and data transfer

e@ Encrypting personal data whilst it is being transferred provides effective protection against interception
by a third party.
You should use encrypted communications channels when transmitting any personal data over an
untrusted network.

@ You can encrypt data prior to transmission over an insecure channel and ensure it is still protected.
However, a secure channel provides assurance that the content cannot be understood if it is intercepted.
Without additional encryption methods, such as encrypting the data itself prior to transmission, the data
will only be encrypted whilst in transit.

@ You should look to use HTTPS across your entire site. While there are some circumstances that can
make this difficult you still need to take appropriate steps such as ensuring that all areas of user input
are protected.

e Encrypted data transfer still poses residual risks. You will need to address these depending on the
context, such as by means of an organisational policy and staff training.

What types of encryption are there?

e The two types of encryption in widespread use today are symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

e@ With symmetric encryption, the same key is used for encryption and decryption. Conversely, with
asymmetric encryption, different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

@ When using symmetric encryption, it is critical to ensure that the key is transferred securely.

e The technique of cryptographic hashing is sometimes equated to encryption, but it is important to
understand that encryption and hashing are not identical concepts, and are used for different purposes.

How should we implement encryption?

@ When implementing encryption it is important to consider four things: choosing the right algorithm,
choosing the right key size, choosing the right software, and keeping the key secure.

@ Over time, vulnerabilities may be discovered in encryption algorithms that can eventually make them
insecure. You should regularly assess whether your encryption method remains appropriate.

e It is important to ensure that the key size is sufficiently large to protect against an attack over the
lifetime of the data. You should therefore assess whether your key sizes remain appropriate.

e@ The encryption software you use is also crucial. You should ensure that any solution you implement
meets current standards such as FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 197.

e Advice on appropriate encryption solutions is available from a number of organisations, including the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

e You should also ensure that you keep your keys secure, and have processes in place to generate new
keys when necessary to do so.

What is a personal data breach?

A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. This includes breaches that are the result
of both accidental and deliberate causes. It also means that a breach is more than just about losing
personal data.

Example
Personal data breaches can include:

@ access by an unauthorised third party;
e deliberate or accidental action (or inaction) by a controller or processor;

@ sending personal data to an incorrect recipient;

728


--- New Page 282 ---
Page number: 282
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

® computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen;
e alteration of personal data without permission; and

@ loss of availability of personal data.

A personal data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of personal data. In short, there will be a personal data breach whenever any
personal data is accidentally lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or
passes it on without proper authorisation; or if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a
significant negative effect on individuals.

Risk-assessing data breaches

Recital 87 of the UK GDPR says that when a security incident takes place, you should quickly establish
whether a personal data breach has occurred and, if so, promptly take steps to address it, including telling
the ICO if required.

Remember, the focus of risk regarding breach reporting is on the potential negative consequences for
individuals. Recital 85 of the UK GDPR explains that:

66

“A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical,
material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or
limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of
pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by
professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person
concerned.”

This means that a breach can have a range of adverse effects on individuals, which include emotional
distress, and physical and material damage. Some personal data breaches will not lead to risks beyond
possible inconvenience to those who need the data to do their job. Other breaches can significantly affect
individuals whose personal data has been compromised. You need to assess this case by case, looking at all
relevant factors.

Example

The theft of a customer database, whose data may be used to commit identity fraud, would need to be
notified, given its likely impact on those individuals who could suffer financial loss or other
consequences. But you would not normally need to notify the ICO, for example, about the loss or
inappropriate alteration of a staff telephone list.

721


--- New Page 283 ---
Page number: 283
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

So, on becoming aware of a breach, you should contain it and assess the potential adverse consequences
for individuals, based on how serious or substantial these are, and how likely they are to happen.

For more details about assessing risk, please see section IV of the Article 29 Working Party guidelines on
personal data breach notification.

When do we need to tell individuals about a breach?

If a breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the UK GDPR says you
must inform those concerned directly and without undue delay. In other words, this should take place as
soon as possible.

A ‘high risk’ means the requirement to inform individuals is higher than for notifying the ICO. Again, you
will need to assess both the severity of the potential or actual impact on individuals as a result of a breach
and the likelihood of this occurring. If the impact of the breach is more severe, the risk is higher; if the
likelihood of the consequences is greater, then again the risk is higher. In such cases, you will need to
promptly inform those affected, particularly if there is a need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage to
them. One of the main reasons for informing individuals is to help them take steps to protect themselves
from the effect of a breach.

Example

e@ A hospital suffers a breach that results in accidental disclosure of patient records. There is likely to
be a significant impact on the affected individuals because of the sensitivity of the data and their
confidential medical details becoming known to others. This is likely to result in a high risk to their
rights and freedoms, so they would need to be informed about the breach.

e A university experiences a breach when a member of staff accidentally deletes a record of alumni
contact details. The details are later re-created from a backup. This is unlikely to result in a high risk
to the rights and freedoms of those individuals. They don’t need to be informed about the breach.

e A medical professional sends incorrect medical records to another professional. They inform the
sender immediately and delete the information securely. This is unlikely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of the individual. They don’t need to be informed about the breach.

If you decide not to notify individuals, you will still need to notify the ICO unless you can demonstrate that
the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to rights and freedoms. You should also remember that the ICO has
the power to compel you to inform affected individuals if we consider there is a high risk. In any event, you
should document your decision-making process in line with the requirements of the accountability
principle.

What information must we provide to individuals when telling them about a breach?

You need to describe, in clear and plain language, the nature of the personal data breach and, at least:

e the name and contact details of any data protection officer you have, or other contact point where more
information can be obtained;

722


--- New Page 284 ---
Page number: 284
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ a description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and
@ a description of the measures taken or proposed to deal with the personal data breach and, where
appropriate, a description of the measures taken to mitigate any possible adverse effects.

If possible, you should give specific and clear advice to individuals on the steps they can take to protect
themselves, and what you are willing to do to help them. Depending on the circumstances, this may include
such things as:

e forcing a password reset;

@ advising individuals to use strong, unique passwords; and

@ telling them to look out for phishing emails or fraudulent activity on their accounts.

What breaches do we need to notify the ICO about?

When a personal data breach has occurred, you need to establish the likelihood of the risk to people’s
rights and freedoms. If a risk is likely, you must notify the ICO; if a risk is unlikely, you don’t have to report
it. However, if you decide you don’t need to report the breach, you need to be able to justify this decision,
so you should document it.

What role do processors have?

If your organisation uses a data processor, and this processor suffers a breach, then under Article 33(2) it
must inform you without undue delay as soon as it becomes aware.

Example

Your organisation (the controller) contracts an IT services firm (the processor) to archive and store
customer records. The IT firm detects an attack on its network that results in personal data about its
clients being unlawfully accessed. As this is a personal data breach, the IT firm promptly notifies you
that the breach has taken place. You in turn notify the ICO, if reportable.

This requirement allows you to take steps to address the breach and meet your breach-reporting
obligations under the UK GDPR.

If you use a processor, the requirements on breach reporting should be detailed in the contract between
you and your processor, as required under Article 28. For more details about contracts, please see our draft
UK GDPR guidance on contracts and liabilities between controllers and processors @.

 

How much time do we have to report a breach?

You must report a notifiable breach to the ICO without undue delay, but not later than 72 hours after
becoming aware of it. If you take longer than this, you must give reasons for the delay.

Section II of the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on personal data breach notification gives more details

723


--- New Page 285 ---
Page number: 285
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

of when a controller can be considered to have ‘become aware’ of a breach.

What information must a breach notification to the ICO contain?

When reporting a breach, the UK GDPR says you must provide:

e@ a description of the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible:
e@ the categories and approximate number of individuals concerned; and
e@ the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;

@ the name and contact details of the data protection officer (if your organisation has one) or other
contact point where more information can be obtained;

e@ a description of the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and

@ a description of the measures taken, or proposed to be taken, to deal with the personal data breach
and, where appropriate, of the measures taken to mitigate any possible adverse effects.

What if we don’t have all the required information available yet?

The UK GDPR recognises that it will not always be possible to investigate a breach fully within 72 hours to
understand exactly what has happened and what needs to be done to mitigate it. So its Article 33(4) allows
you to provide the required information in phases, as long as this is done without undue further delay.

However, we expect controllers to prioritise the investigation, give it adequate resources, and expedite it
urgently. You must still notify us of the breach when you become aware of it, and submit further
information as soon as possible. If you know you won't be able to provide full details within 72 hours, itis a
good idea to explain the delay to us and tell us when you expect to submit more information.

Example

You detect an intrusion into your network and become aware that files containing personal data have
been accessed, but you don’t know how the attacker gained entry, to what extent that data was
accessed, or whether the attacker also copied the data from your system.

You notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, explaining that you don’t yet have
all the relevant details, but that you expect to have the results of your investigation within a few days.
Once your investigation uncovers details about the incident, you give the ICO more information about
the breach without delay.

How do we notify a breach to the ICO?

To notify the ICO of a personal data breach, please see our pages on reporting a breach. These pages

 

 

Remember, a breach affecting individuals in EEA countries will engage the EU GDPR. This means that as

724


--- New Page 286 ---
Page number: 286
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

part of your breach response plan, you should establish which European data protection agency would be
your lead supervisory authority for the processing activities that have been subject to the breach. For more

identifying your lead authority @.

 

Does the UK GDPR require us to take any other steps in response to a breach?

You should ensure that you record all breaches, regardless of whether or not they need to be reported to
the ICO.

Article 33(5) requires you to document the facts regarding the breach, its effects and the remedial action
taken. This is part of your overall obligation to comply with the accountability principle, and allows us to
verify your organisation’s compliance with its notification duties under the UK GDPR.

As with any security incident, you should investigate whether or not the breach was a result of human error
or a systemic issue and see how a recurrence can be prevented. Human error is the leading cause of
reported data breaches. To reduce the risk of this, consider:

@ mandatory data protection induction and refresher training;
® support and supervising until employees are proficient in their role.
®@ updating policies and procedures for employees should feel able to report incidents of near misses;
@ working to a principle of “check twice, send once”;
@ implementing a culture of trust - employees should feel able to report incidents of near misses;
@ investigating the root causes of breaches and near misses; and
® protecting your employees and the personal data you are responsible for. This could include:
e@ Restricting access and auditing systems, or
© Implementing technical and organisational measures, eg disabling autofill.
As mentioned previously, as part of your breach management process you should undertake a risk
assessment and have an appropriate risk assessment matrix to help you manage breaches on a day-to-day
basis. This will help you to assess the impact of breaches and meet your reporting and recording

requirements. This will provide a basis for your breach policy and help you demonstrate your accountability
as a data controller.

What else should we take into account?

The following aren’t specific UK GDPR requirements regarding breaches, but you should take them into
account when you’ve experienced a breach.

As a result of a breach an organisation may experience a higher volume of data protection requests or
complaints, particularly in relation to access requests and erasure. You should have a contingency plan in
place to deal with the possibility of this. It is important that you continue to deal with those requests and
complaints, alongside any other work that has been generated as a result of the breach. You should also
consider how you might manage the impact to individuals, including explaining how they may pursue
compensation should the situation warrant it.

It is important to be aware that you may have additional notification obligations under other laws if you

725


--- New Page 287 ---
Page number: 287
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

experience a personal data breach. For example:

e@ If you are a communications service provider, you must notify the ICO of any personal data breach
within 24 hours under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). You should use
our PECR breach notification form, rather than the GDPR process. Please see our pages on PECR for
more details.

e@ If you are a UK trust service provider, you must notify the ICO of a security breach that may include a
personal data breach within 24 hours under the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS)
Regulation. You can use our eIDAS breach notification form @ or the GDPR breach-reporting process.
However, if you report it to us under the UK GDPR, this still must be done within 24 hours. Please read
our Guide to eIDAS for more information.

e If your organisation is an operator of essential services or a digital service provider, you will have
incident-reporting obligations under the NIS Directive. These are separate from personal data breach
notification under the UK GDPR. If you suffer an incident that’s also a personal data breach, you will still
need to report it to the ICO separately, and you should use the GDPR process for doing so.

You may also need to consider notifying third parties such as the police, insurers, professional bodies, or
bank or credit card companies who can help reduce the risk of financial loss to individuals.

Personal Data Breach Notification @. Although the UK has left the EU, these guidelines continue to be
relevant. You should also be aware of any recommendations issued under relevant codes of conduct or
sector-specific requirements that your organisation may be subject to.

 

What happens if we fail to notify the ICO of all notifiable breaches?

Failing to notify the ICO of a breach when required to do so can result in a heavy fine of up to £8.7 million
or 2 per cent of your global turnover. The fine can be combined with the ICO’s other corrective powers
under Article 58. It is important to make sure you have a robust breach-reporting process in place to
ensure you detect, and notify breaches, on time and to provide the necessary details, unless the personal
data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. If you decide you
don’t need to report the breach, you need to be able to justify this decision, so you should document it.

International transfers after the UK exit from the EU
Implementation Period

How have the rules on restricted transfers changed, now that the Brexit
transition period has ended?

Commission has found the UK to be adequate. This means that most data can continue to flow from the EU
and the EEA without the need for additional safeguards. The adequacy decisions do not cover data
transferred to the UK for the purposes of immigration control, or where the UK immigration exemption
applies. For this kind of data, different rules apply and the EEA sender needs to put other transfer
safeguards in place.

 

This guidance is about transferring data overseas from the UK. For further information on receiving
personal data from the EEA, read our detailed guidance on data protection and the EU.

 

Restricted transfers from the UK to other countries, including to the EEA, are subject to transfer rules under
the UK regime. These UK transfer rules broadly mirror the EU GDPR rules, but the UK has the independence
to keep the framework under review.

There are transitional arrangements which aim to smooth the transition to the new UK regime.

First, there are provisions which permit the transfer of personal data from UK to the EEA and to any
countries which, as at 31 December 2020, were covered by a European Commission ‘adequacy decision’.
This is to be kept under review by the UK Government.

The UK government has the power to make its own ‘adequacy decisions’ in relation to third countries and
international organisations. In the UK regime these are known as ‘adequacy regulations’.

There are also provisions which allow the continued use of any EU Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs'),
valid as at 31 December 2020, as long as the contract was entered into before 21 September 2022.

 

Finally, there are provisions which allow certain Binding Corporate Rules to transition into the UK regime.

Checklist

1. Are we planning to make a restricted transfer of personal data outside of the UK?
If no, you can make the transfer. If yes go to Q2

2. Do we need to make a restricted transfer of personal data in order to meet our
purposes?
If no, you can make the transfer without any personal data. If yes go to Q3

3. Are there UK ‘adequacy regulations’ in relation to the country or territory where the
receiver is located or a sector which covers the receiver (which currently includes
countries in the EEA and countries, territories or sectors covered by existing EU
‘adequacy decisions’)?
If yes, you can make the transfer. If no go to Q4

4. Are we putting in place one of the ‘appropriate safeguards’ referred to in the UK
GDPR?
If yes, go to Q5 If no go to Q6

5. Having undertaken a risk assessment, we are satisfied that the data subjects of the
transferred data continue to have a level of protection essentially equivalent to that
under the UK data protection regime.

If yes, you can make the transfer. If no, go to Q6.

6. Does an exception provided for in the UK GDPR apply?
If yes, you can make the transfer. If no, you cannot make the transfer in accordance with the
UK GDPR

If you reach the end without finding a provision which permits the restricted transfer, you will be
unable to make that restricted transfer in accordance with the UK GDPR.

Are we making a transfer of personal data outside the UK?

1) Are we making a restricted transfer?
You are making a restricted transfer if:

e@ the UK GDPR applies to your processing of the personal data you are transferring.

e The scope of the UK data protection regime is set out in Articles 2 and 3 of the UK GDPR and section
207 DPA 2018 (where the DPA 2018, which incorporated the UK GDPR, applies). Please see the section
of the guide What is personal data.

@ You are agreeing to send personal data, or make it accessible, to a receiver which is located in a country
outside the UK; and

e the receiver is legally distinct from you as it is a separate company, organisation or individual. This
includes transfers to another company within the same corporate group. However, if you are sending
personal data to someone employed by you or by your company or organisation, this is not a restricted
transfer. The transfer restrictions only apply if you are sending personal data outside your company or
organisation.

730


--- New Page 292 ---
Page number: 292
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

A UK company uses a centralised human resources service in the United States provided by its parent
company. The UK company passes information about its employees to its parent company in connection
with the HR service. This is a restricted transfer.

Example

A UK company sells holidays in Australia. It sends the personal data of customers who have bought the
holidays to the hotels they have chosen in Australia in order to secure their bookings. This is a
restricted transfer.

Transfer does not mean the same as transit. If personal data is just electronically routed through a
non-UK country but the transfer is actually from one UK organisation to another, then it is not a
restricted transfer.

Example

Personal data is transferred from a controller in the UK to another controller in the UK via a server in
Australia. There is no intention that the personal data will be accessed or manipulated while it is in
Australia. Therefore there is no restricted transfer.

You are making a restricted transfer if you collect information about individuals on paper, which is not
ordered or structured in any way, and you send this to a service company located outside of the UK, to:

@ put into digital form; or

@ add to a highly structured manual filing system relating to individuals.

Example

A UK insurance broker sends a set of notes about individual customers to a company outside the UK.
These notes are handwritten and are not stored on computer or in any particular order. The non-UK
company adds the notes to a computer customer management system. This is a restricted transfer.

Putting personal data on to a website will often result in a restricted transfer. The restricted transfer

731


--- New Page 293 ---
Page number: 293
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

takes place when someone outside the UK accesses that personal data via the website.

If you load personal data onto a UK server which is then available through a website, and you plan or
anticipate that the website may be accessed from outside the UK, you should treat this as a restricted
transfer.

For organisations

Do we need to make a restricted transfer?

Before making a restricted transfer you should consider whether you can achieve your aims without
actually sending personal data.

If you make the data anonymous so that it is never possible to identify individuals (even when combined
with other information which is available to receiver), it is not personal data. This means that the
restrictions do not apply and you are free to transfer the anonymised data outside the UK.

How do we make a restricted transfer in accordance with the UK GDPR?

You must work through the following questions, in order.

If by the last question, you are still unable to make the restricted transfer, then it will be in breach of the
UK GDPR.

Is the restricted transfer covered by ‘adequacy regulations’?

You may make a restricted transfer if the receiver is located in a third country or territory or is an
international organisation, covered by UK “adequacy regulations”.

UK “adequacy regulations” set out in law that the legal framework in that country, territory, sector or
international organisation has been assessed as providing ‘adequate’ protection for individuals’ rights and
freedoms for their personal data.

There are provisional arrangements so that UK “adequacy regulations” include the EEA and all countries,
territories and international organisations covered by European Commission “adequacy decisions” valid as

732


--- New Page 294 ---
Page number: 294
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

at 31 December 2020. The UK intends to review these adequacy regulations over time.
1) What countries or territories are covered by adequacy regulations?
The UK has “adequacy regulations” in relation to the following countries and territories:

e The European Economic Area (EEA) countries.
e These are the EU member states and the EFTA States.

e The EU member states are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.

e The EFTA states are Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.

e EU or EEA institutions, bodies, offices or agencies.
e@ Gibraltar.

e Countries, territories and sectors covered by the European Commission’s adequacy decisions (in force at
31 December 2020)

@ These include a full finding of adequacy about the following countries and territories:
e Andorra, Argentina, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Israel, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland
and Uruguay.
@ In addition, the partial findings of adequacy about:
e Japan - only covers private sector organisations.

@ Canada - only covers data that is subject to Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic
Documents Act (PIPEDA). Not all data is subject to PIPEDA. For more details please see the EU
Commission's FAQs on the adequacy finding on the Canadian PIPEDA.

2) What if there is no adequacy decision?

You should move on to the next section Is the transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?

Is the restricted transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?

If there are no UK ‘adequacy regulations’ about the country, territory or sector for your restricted transfer,
you should then find out whether you can make the transfer subject to ‘appropriate safeguards’.

There is a list of appropriate safeguards in the UK GDPR. Each ensures that both you and the receiver of
the restricted transfer are legally required to protect individuals’ rights and freedoms in respect of their
personal data.

Have you undertaken a transfer impact assessment?

733


--- New Page 295 ---
Page number: 295
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Before you may rely on an appropriate safeguard to make a restricted transfer, you must be satisfied that
the data subjects of the transferred data continue to have a level of protection essentially equivalent to that
under the UK data protection regime.

You should do this by undertaking a risk assessment, which takes into account the protections contained in
that appropriate safeguard and the legal framework of the destination country (including laws governing
public authority access to the data).

If your assessment is that the appropriate safeguard does not provide the required level of protection, you
may include additional measures.

This assessment is undoubtedly complex in many situations. The ICO intends to issue guidance on this
topic in due course.

Further reading

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) have published adopted recommendations on measures
that supplement transfer tools. The recommendations apply to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are
included here only as useful reference about additional measures. We will be producing our own
guidance on this topic in due course.

 

 

Each appropriate safeguard is set out below:
1. A legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies

You can make a restricted transfer if it is covered by a legal instrument between public authorities or bodies
containing ‘appropriate safeguards’. The ‘appropriate safeguards’ must include enforceable rights and
effective remedies for the individuals whose personal data is transferred.

This agreement or legal instrument could also be entered into with an international organisation.

Further Reading

Kr Relevant provisions in the legislation — see UK GDPR Article 46 and Recitals 108-109 and 114 @

External link

2. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
3. Standard contractual clauses (SCCs)

You can make a restricted transfer if you and the receiver have entered into a contract incorporating
standard data protection clauses recognised or issued in accordance with the UK data protection regime.
These are known as ‘standard contractual clauses’ (‘SCCs’ or ‘model clauses’).

The SCCs contain contractual obligations on you (the data exporter) and the receiver (the data importer),
and rights for the individuals whose personal data is transferred. Individuals can directly enforce those

734


--- New Page 296 ---
Page number: 296
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

rights against the data importer and the data exporter.

EU SCCs entered into prior to the end of the transitional period continue to be valid for restricted transfers
under the UK regime.

The European Commission issued new EU SCCs on 04 June 2021. These are not valid for restricted
transfers under UK GDPR (but see the next paragraph).

Following a consultation, the ICO has now issued new data protection clauses for restricted transfers, which
will replace the old EU SCCs. There is a new International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and a new
International Data Transfer Addendum to the new European Commission SCCs (Addendum). These were
laid before Parliament on 28 January 2022. Provided that there are no objections, these documents will be
in force on 21 March 2022.

 

 

The ICO has also issued a document setting out transitional provisions regarding the current EU SCCs; this
was also laid before Parliament on 28 January 2022.

You may continue to enter into new contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs until 21 September 2022. All
contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs will continue to provide ‘appropriate safeguards’ for the purpose
of UK GDPR, until 21 March 2024. From that date, if your restricted transfers continue, you must enter into
a contract on the basis of the IDTA or the Addendum or find another way to make the restricted transfer
under the UK GDPR.

When you are entering into a contract on the basis of the IDTA or the Addendum you must still carry out a
risk assessment. This is to make sure that the actual protection provided by the IDTA or Addendum, given
the actual circumstances of the restricted transfer, is sufficiently similar to the principles underpinning UK

data protection laws.

Example

A family books a holiday in Australia with a UK travel company. The UK travel company sends details of
the booking to the Australian hotel.

Each company is a separate controller, as it is processing the personal data for its own purposes and
making its own decisions.

The contract between the UK travel company and the hotel should use controller to controller standard
contractual clauses.

The UK travel company must also undertake a transfer impact assessment, and if necessary include
additional measures to ensure that the data subjects of the transferred data continue to have a level of
protection essentially equivalent to that under the UK data protection regime.

If you are making a restricted transfer from a controller to a processor, you also need to comply with
the UK GDPR requirements about using processors.

4. An approved code of conduct

You can make a restricted transfer if the receiver has signed up to a code of conduct, which has been
approved by the ICO. The code of conduct must include appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of
individuals whose personal data is transferred, with a binding and enforceable commitment by the receiver
to apply those appropriate safeguards.

The UK GDPR endorses the use of approved codes of conduct to demonstrate compliance with its
requirements.

 

No approved codes of conduct are yet in use, but we are actively working with various sector bodies and
associations. We will publish further information once codes of conduct are approved.

5. Certification under an approved certification scheme

You can make a restricted transfer if the receiver has a certification, under a scheme approved by the ICO.
The certification scheme must include appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of individuals whose
personal data is transferred, with a binding and enforceable commitment by the receiver to apply those

736


--- New Page 298 ---

appropriate safeguards.

its requirements.

 

No approved certification schemes are yet in use as an appropriate safeguard for international
transfers. The ICO will provide separate guidelines in relation to the use of certification schemes as a
mechanism to facilitate international transfers in due course.

6. Contractual clauses authorised by the ICO

You can make a restricted transfer if you and the receiver have entered into a bespoke contract governing a
specific restricted transfer which has been individually authorised by the ICO. This means that if you are
making a restricted transfer from the UK, the ICO will have had to have approved the contract.

7. Administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies
You can make a restricted transfer using:

e An administrative arrangement (usually a document, such as a memorandum of understanding)
between public authorities or bodies.

@ The administrative arrangement must set out ‘appropriate safeguards’ for the rights of the individuals
whose personal data is to be transferred. The ‘appropriate safeguards’ must include effective and
enforceable rights for the individuals whose personal data is transferred.

e The administrative arrangement must be individually authorised by the ICO.

What if the restricted transfer is not covered by appropriate safeguards?

If the restricted transfer is not covered by appropriate safeguards, then you need to consider the next
question: Is the restricted transfer covered by an exception?

 

Is the restricted transfer covered by an exception?

If you are making a restricted transfer that is not covered by UK ‘adequacy regulations’, nor an appropriate
safeguard, then you can only make that transfer if it is covered by one of the ‘exceptions’ set out in Article
49 of the UK GDPR.

You should only use these as true ‘exceptions’ from the general rule that you should not make a restricted

If it is covered by an exception, you may go ahead with the restricted transfer. Of course, you must still

737


--- New Page 299 ---
Page number: 299
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

comply with the rest of the UK GDPR.
Each exception is set out below:

Exception 1. Has the individual given his or her explicit consent to the restricted transfer?

As a valid consent must be both specific and informed, you must provide the individual with precise details
about the restricted transfer. You cannot obtain a valid consent for restricted transfers in general.

You should tell the individual:

e the identity of the receiver, or the categories of receiver;

@ the country or countries to which the data is to be transferred;
@ why you need to make a restricted transfer;

@ the type of data;

@ the individual’s right to withdraw consent; and

e the possible risks involved in making a transfer to a country which does not provide adequate protection
for personal data and without any other appropriate safeguards in place. For example, you might explain
that there will be no local supervisory authority, and no (or only limited) individual data protection or
privacy rights.

Given the high threshold for a valid consent, and that the consent must be capable of being withdrawn, this
may mean that using consent is not a feasible solution.

Exception 2. Do you have a contract with the individual? Is the restricted transfer necessary for
you to perform that contract?

Are you about to enter into a contract with the individual? Is the restricted transfer necessary
for you to take steps requested by the individual in order to enter into that contract?

This exception explicitly states that it can only be used for occasional restricted transfers. This means that
the restricted transfer may happen more than once but not regularly. If you are regularly making restricted

The transfer must also be necessary, which means that you cannot perform the core purpose of the
contract or the core purpose of the steps needed to enter into the contract, without making the restricted
transfer. It does not cover a transfer for you to use a cloud based IT system.

Example

A UK travel company offering bespoke travel arrangements may rely on this exception to send personal
data to a hotel in Peru, provided that it does not regularly arrange for its customers to stay at that

It is only necessary to send limited personal data for this purpose, such as the name of the guest, the

738


--- New Page 300 ---
Page number: 300
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

room required and the length of stay.

Example of necessary steps being taken at the individual’s request in order to enter into a contract:
Before the package is confirmed (and the contract entered into), the individual wishes to reserve a
room in the Peruvian hotel. The UK travel company has to send the Peruvian hotel the name of the
customer in order to hold the room.

Public authorities cannot rely on this exception when exercising their public powers.

Exception 3. Do you have (or are you entering into) a contract with an individual which benefits
another individual whose data is being transferred? Is that transfer necessary for you to either
enter into that contract or perform that contract?

As set out in Exception 2, you may only use this exception for occasional transfers, and the transfer must
be necessary for you to perform the core purposes of the contract or to enter into that contract.

You may rely on both Exceptions 2 and 3: Exception 2 for the individual entering into the contract and
Exception 3 for other people benefiting from that contract, often family members.

Exceptions 2 and 3 are not identical. You cannot rely on Exception 3 for any restricted transfers needed for
steps taken prior to entering in to the contract.

Public authorities cannot rely on this exception when exercising their public powers.

Example

Following the Exception 2 example, Exception 3 may apply if the customer is buying the travel package
for themselves and their family. Once the customer has bought the package with the UK travel
company, it may be necessary to send the names of the family members to Peruvian hotel in order to
book the rooms.

Exception 4: You need to make the restricted transfer for important reasons of public interest.

There must be a UK law which states or implies that this type of transfer is allowed for important reasons of
public interest, which may be in the spirit of reciprocity for international co-operation. For example an
international agreement or convention (which the UK has signed) that recognises certain objectives and
provides for international co-operation (such as the 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism ().

 

 

This can be relied upon by both public and private entities.

If a request is made by a non-EEA authority, requesting a restrictive transfer under this exception, and
there is an international agreement such as a mutual assistance treaty (MLAT), you should consider
referring the request to the existing MLAT or agreement.

You should not rely on this exception for systematic transfers. Instead, you should consider one of the

739


--- New Page 301 ---
Page number: 301
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

yourself that the transfer is necessary for an important reason of public interest.

Exception 5: You need to make the restricted transfer to establish if you have a legal claim, to
make a legal claim or to defend a legal claim.

This exception explicitly states that you can only use it for occasional transfers. This means that the
transfer may happen more than once but not regularly. If you are regularly transferring personal data, you

The transfer must be necessary, so there must be a close connection between the need for the transfer and
the relevant legal claim.

The claim must have a basis in law, and a formal legally defined process, but it is not just judicial or
administrative procedures. This means that you can interpret what is a legal claim quite widely, to cover, for
example:

@ all judicial legal claims, in civil law (including contract law) and criminal law. The court procedure does
not need to have been started, and it covers out-of-court procedures. It covers formal pre-trial discovery
procedures.

@ administrative or regulatory procedures, such as to defend an investigation (or potential investigation) in
competition law or financial services regulation, or to seek approval for a merger.

You cannot rely on this exception if there is only the mere possibility that a legal claim or other formal
proceedings may be brought in the future.

Public authorities can rely on this exception, in relation to the exercise of their powers.

Exception 6: You need to make the restricted transfer to protect the vital interests of an
individual. He or she must be physically or legally incapable of giving consent.

This applies in a medical emergency where the transfer is needed in order to give the medical care
required. The imminent risk of serious harm to the individual must outweigh any data protection concerns.

You cannot rely on this exception to carry out general medical research.

If the individual is physically and legally capable of giving consent, then you cannot rely on this exception.

 

Exception 7: You are making the restricted transfer from a public register.
The register must be created under UK law and must be open to either:

@ the public in general; or

@ any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest.

For example, registers of companies, associations, land registers or public vehicle registers. The whole of
the register cannot be transferred, nor whole categories of personal data.

748


--- New Page 302 ---
Page number: 302
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The transfer must comply with any general laws which apply to disclosures from the public register. If the
register has been established at law and access is only given to those with a legitimate interest, part of that
assessment must take into account the data protection rights of the individuals whose personal data is to
be transferred. This may include consideration of the risk to that personal data by transferring it to a
country with less protection.

This does not cover registers run by private companies, such as credit reference databases.

Exception 8: you are making a one-off restricted transfer and it is in your compelling legitimate
interests.

If you cannot rely on any of the other exceptions, there is one final exception to consider. This exception
should not be relied on lightly and never routinely as it is only for truly exceptional circumstances.

For this exception to apply to your restricted transfer:

1. there must be no UK ‘adequacy regulations’ which apply.

2. you are unable to use any of the other appropriate safeguards. You must give serious consideration to
this, even if it would involve significant investment from you.

3. none of the other exceptions apply. Again, you must give serious consideration to the other exceptions.
It may be that you can obtain explicit consent with some effort or investment.

4. your transfer must not be repetitive — that is it may happen more than once but not regularly.

5. the personal data must only relate to a limited number of individuals. There is no absolute threshold for
this. The number of individuals involved should be part of the balancing exercise you must undertake in
para (g) below.

6. The transfer must be necessary for your compelling legitimate interests. Please see the section of the
guide on legitimate interests as a lawful basis for processing, but bearing mind that this exception
requires a higher standard, as it must be a compelling legitimate interest. An example is a transfer of
personal data to protect a company’s IT systems from serious immediate harm.

7. On balance your compelling legitimate interests outweigh the rights and freedoms of the individuals.

8. You have made a full assessment of the circumstances surrounding the transfer and provided suitable
safeguards to protect the personal data. Suitable safeguards might be strict confidentiality agreements,
a requirement for data to be deleted soon after transfer, technical controls to prevent the use of the data
for other purposes, or sending pseudonymised or encrypted data. This must be recorded in full in your
documentation of your processing activities.

9. You have informed the ICO of the transfer. We will ask to see full details of all the steps you have taken
as set out above.

.0. You have informed the individual of the transfer and explained your compelling legitimate interest to
them.

In more detail - European Data Protection Board

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49
under Regulation 2016/679. These guidelines apply to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are included
only as useful reference.

 

 

From 21 September 2022, the EU Contractual clauses issued by the European Commission under the
old Data Protection Directive (the old EU SCCs), are no longer valid for new restricted transfers from
the UK. They remain valid if they were used in existing contracts entered into prior to 21 September
2022 until March 2024.

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) after the
transition period ends

The EU Commission announced on 28 June 2021 that adequacy decisions for the UK have been
approved. We are in the process of updating our guidance to reflect this decision.

Once the transition period for leaving the EU ends, the UK will be able to produce its own SCCs for
restricted transfers made from the UK. In the meantime, UK controllers can continue to use the existing EU
SCCs (valid as at 31 December). See below for more detail.

some time in 2021. This means they will not be valid SCCs for restricted transfers from the UK.

The recent Schrems II decision will continue to apply if you are making a restricted transfer from the UK
using SCCs. This decision requires that you must make an assessment as to whether those SCCs provide
protection which is ‘essentially equivalent’ to the protections in the UK data protection regime, and if
necessary put in place additional measures.

This assessment is undoubtedly complex in many situations. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
have published for consultation, Recommendations on measures that supplement transfer tools @. We
expect the final version to be issued some time in 2021. The recommendations (when finalised) will apply
to the EU GDPR transfer regime, and are included here only as useful reference about additional measures.
The ICO intends to issue its own guidance on this topic in due course.

 

New Restricted Transfers from the UK

You can continue to use the current EU SCCs for restricted transfers from the UK.

You are able to make changes to those EU SCCs so they make sense in a UK context provided you do not
change the legal meaning of the SCCs. For example, changing references from the old EU Data Protection
to the UK GDPR, changing references to the EU or Member States, to the UK, and changing references to a
supervisory authority to the ICO.

Otherwise you must not make any changes to the SCCs, unless it is to add protections or more clauses on
business related issues. You can add parties (ie additional data importers or exporters) provided they are
also bound by the SCCs.

We have created UK versions of the SCCs (with guidance), with suggested UK changes made for you.

Existing data transfers

After the transition period ends, you can continue to rely on existing SCCs which you have in place for
restricted transfers from the UK. Although after the Schrems II decision, you should be reviewing whether
they provide sufficient protection for data subjects and if necessary taking additional measures.

Future changes to SCCs

The ICO has consulted on UK SCCs and intends to publish them in 2022.

The ICO and the Secretary of State must keep the transitional arrangements for SCCs under review. It may
be that at some point the EU SCCs will cease to be valid, for new and/or existing restricted transfers from
the UK. The ICO will provide more information about this when this situation arises, giving you plenty of
notice.

International data transfer agreement and guidance

On 2 February 2022, the Secretary of State laid before Parliament the international data transfer
agreement (IDTA), the international data transfer addendum to the European Commission’s standard
contractual clauses for international data transfers (Addendum) and a document setting out transitional
provisions. This final step followed the consultation the ICO ran in 2021. The documents were issued under
Section 119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 and following Parliamentary approval came into force on 21
March 2022.

Exporters can use the IDTA or the Addendum as a transfer tool to comply with Article 46 of the UK GDPR
when making restricted transfers.

The IDTA and Addendum replaced standard contractual clauses for international transfers. They take into
account the binding judgement of the European Court of Justice, in the case commonly referred to as
“Schrems II”.

These documents are immediately of use to organisations transferring personal data outside of the UK:

@ Transitional provisions @

The IDTA and Addendum form part of the wider UK package to assist international transfers. This includes
independently supporting the Government’s approach to adequacy assessments of third countries.

We consulted on our approach to international transfers under UK GDPR from 11 August 2021 to 11
October 2021. When finalising the documents we considered the detailed responses we received and will be
publishing these soon.

In our Guide to UK GDPR we have added clarification as to what is a restricted transfer. We are developing

Exemptions

At a glance

e The UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 set out exemptions from some of the rights and
obligations in some circumstances.

e@ Whether or not you can rely on an exemption often depends on why you process personal data.
@ You should not routinely rely on exemptions; you should consider them on a case-by-case basis.
@ You should justify and document your reasons for relying on an exemption.

Exemptions

CU We consider whether we can rely on an exemption on a case-by-case basis.

XO) Where appropriate, we carefully consider the extent to which the relevant UK GDPR
requirements would be likely to prevent, seriously impair, or prejudice the achievement of our
processing purposes.

O We justify and document our reasons for relying on an exemption.

What are exemptions?

In some circumstances, the DPA 2018 provides an exemption from particular UK GDPR provisions. If an
exemption applies, you may not have to comply with all the usual rights and obligations.

There are several different exemptions; these are detailed in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018. They add to
and complement a number of exceptions already built in to certain UK GDPR provisions.

746


--- New Page 308 ---
Page number: 308
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

This part of the Guide focuses on the exemptions in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018. We give guidance on
the exceptions built in to the UK GDPR in the parts of the Guide that relate to the relevant provisions.

The exemptions in the DPA 2018 can relieve you of some of your obligations for things such as:

@ the right to be informed;

@ the right of access;

@ dealing with other individual rights;

@ reporting personal data breaches; and

® complying with the principles.
Some exemptions apply to only one of the above, but others can exempt you from several things.

Some things are not listed here as exemptions, although in practice they work a bit like an exemption. This
is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR. Here are some examples:

e Domestic purposes - personal data processed in the course of a purely personal or household activity,
with no connection to a professional or commercial activity, is outside the UK GDPR’s scope. This means
that if you only use personal data for such things as writing to friends and family or taking pictures for
your own enjoyment, you are not subject to the UK GDPR.

e Law enforcement - the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement
purposes is outside the UK GDPR’s scope (e.g. the Police investigating a crime). Instead, this type of
processing is subject to the rules in Part 3 of the DPA 2018. See our Guide to Law Enforcement
Processing for further information.

e Intelligence services processing - personal data processed by the intelligence services (eg MI5) and
their processors is outside the UK GDPR’s scope. Instead, this type of processing is subject to the rules
in Part 4 of the DPA 2018. See our Guide to Intelligence Services Processing for further information.

How do exemptions work?

Whether or not you can rely on an exemption generally depends on your purposes for processing personal
data.

Some exemptions apply simply because you have a particular purpose. But others only apply to the extent
that complying with the UK GDPR would:

@ be likely to prejudice your purpose (e.g. have a damaging or detrimental effect on what you are doing);
or

@ prevent or seriously impair you from processing personal data in a way that is required or necessary for
your purpose.

Exemptions should not routinely be relied upon or applied in a blanket fashion. You must consider each
exemption on a case-by-case basis.

If an exemption does apply, sometimes you will be obliged to rely on it (for instance, if complying with UK
GDPR would break another law), but sometimes you can choose whether or not to rely on it.

In line with the accountability principle, you should justify and document your reasons for relying on an

747


--- New Page 309 ---
Page number: 309
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

exemption so you can demonstrate your compliance.

If you cannot identify an exemption that covers what you are doing with personal data, you must comply
with the UK GDPR as normal.

Crime and taxation: general

There are two parts to this exemption. The first part can apply if you process personal data for the
purposes of:

@ the prevention and detection of crime;

e the apprehension or prosecution of offenders; or

@ the assessment or collection of a tax or duty or an imposition of a similar nature.
It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

e the right to be informed;

@ all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling;

@ notifying individuals of personal data breaches;

e the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle, except the requirement for processing to be lawful;

749


--- New Page 311 ---
Page number: 311
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

@ the purpose limitation principle; and

@ all the other principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the other individual
rights.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would be likely to
prejudice your purposes of processing. If this is not so, you must comply with the UK GDPR as normal.

Example

A bank conducts an investigation into suspected financial fraud. The bank wants to pass its
investigation file, including the personal data of several customers, to the National Crime Agency (NCA)
for further investigation. The bank’s investigation and proposed disclosure to the NCA are for the
purposes of the prevention and detection of crime. The bank decides that, were it to inform the
individuals in question about this processing of their personal data, this would be likely to prejudice the
investigation because they might abscond or destroy evidence. So the bank relies on the crime and
taxation exemption and, in this case, does not comply with the right to be informed.

The second part of this exemption applies when another controller obtains personal data processed for any
of the purposes mentioned above for the purposes of discharging statutory functions. The controller that
obtains the personal data is exempt from the UK GDPR provisions below to the same extent that the
original controller was exempt:

@ The right to be informed.

e The right of access.

e All the principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the right of access.

Note that if you are a competent authority processing personal data for law enforcement purposes (e.g. the
Police conducting a criminal investigation), your processing is subject to the rules of Part 3 of the DPA

2018. See our Guide to Law Enforcement Processing for information on how individual rights may be
restricted when personal data is processed for law enforcement purposes by competent authorities.

Information required to be disclosed by law or in connection with legal
proceedings

This exemption has three parts. The first part can apply if you are required by law to make personal data
available to the public.

It exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

e all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling;

e the lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle, except the requirement for processing to be lawful;
@ the purpose limitation principle; and
@ all the other principles, but only so far as they relate to the right to be informed and the other individual

rights.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would prevent you
meeting your legal obligation to make personal data publicly available.

751


--- New Page 313 ---
Page number: 313
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Example

The Registrar of Companies is legally obliged to maintain a public register of certain information about
companies, including the names and (subject to certain restrictions) addresses of company directors. A
director asks to exercise his right to erasure by having his name and address removed from the
register. The request does not need to be complied with as it would prevent the Registrar meeting his
legal obligation to make that information publicly available.

The second part of this exemption can apply if you are required by law, or court order, to disclose personal
data to a third party. It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that
complying with those provisions would prevent you disclosing the personal data.

Example

An employer receives a court order to hand over the personnel file of one of its employees to an
insurance company for the assessment of a claim. Normally, the employer would not be able to disclose
this information because doing so would be incompatible with the original purposes for collecting the
data (contravening the purpose limitation principle). However, on this occasion the employer is exempt
from the purpose limitation principle’s requirements because it would prevent the employer disclosing
personal data that it must do by court order.

The third part of this exemption can apply if it is necessary for you to disclose personal data for the
purposes of, or in connection with:

e legal proceedings, including prospective legal proceedings;
® obtaining legal advice; or

e establishing, exercising or defending legal rights.

It exempts you from the same provisions as above, but only to the extent that complying with them would
prevent you disclosing the personal data. If complying with these provisions would not prevent the
disclosure, you cannot rely on the exemption.

Example

A primary school collects information about the parents of the children who attend the school. The
school has informed the parents that they will only use their personal data for specified purposes
related to the care, welfare and education of their children.

However, a dispute has arisen between a teacher and one of the parents of a 7 year old child. The

752


--- New Page 314 ---
Page number: 314

matter escalates, and the parent makes a number of allegations against the teacher. The school is
concerned that the parent’s behaviour is threatening and abusive, and decides to take legal action
against them. The parent writes to the school and asks it not to share their information with any other
organisation or individual.

The school relies on the exemption to the extent that complying with the request, and complying with
the purpose limitation principle, would prevent it from disclosing the information to its solicitor.

enactment.

Immigration

The exemption outlines specific rights in the UK GDPR which can be restricted if those rights would be likely
to prejudice immigration matters.

The exemption can only be applied by the Secretary of State (including the Home Office and its agencies)
when processing data for the purposes of maintaining effective immigration control, including
investigatory/detection work (the immigration purposes).

The exemption is not available to other controllers who liaise with the Home Office on immigration matters.
The Secretary of State exempts you from the UK GDPR’s provisions on:

@ the right to be informed;

e the right of access;

@ the right to erasure;

e the right to restrict processing;

@ the right to object;

@ all the principles, but only so far as they relate to the rights to be informed, of access, to erasure, to

restrict processing and to object.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that applying these provisions would be likely to prejudice
processing for the immigration purposes. If not, the exemption does not apply.

The Secretary of State is required to keep records of the use of the exemption and to inform individuals
that the exemption has been applied unless it would be prejudicial to immigration purposes to inform them.

The exemption also requires that the Secretary of State has an immigration exemption policy document in
place.

Functions designed to protect the public

This exemption can apply if you process personal data for the purposes of discharging one of six functions
designed to protect the public.

The first four functions must: be conferred on a person by enactment; be a function of the Crown, a
Minister of the Crown or a government department; or be of a public nature and exercised in the public
interest. These functions are:

1. to protect the public against financial loss due to the seriously improper conduct (or unfitness, or
incompetence) of financial services providers, or in the management of bodies corporate, or due to the
conduct of bankrupts;

2. to protect the public against seriously improper conduct (or unfitness, or incompetence);

3. to protect charities or community interest companies against misconduct or mismanagement in their
administration, to protect the property of charities or community interest companies from loss or
misapplication, or to recover the property of charities or community interest companies; or

4. to secure workers’ health, safety and welfare or to protect others against health and safety risks in
connection with (or arising from) someone at work.

The fifth function must be conferred by enactment on: the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration;
the Commissioner for Local Administration in England; the Health Service Commissioner for England; the
Public Services Ombudsman for Wales; the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman; the Prison
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland; or the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. This function is:

5. to protect the public from maladministration, or a failure in services provided by a public body, or from
the failure to provide a service that it is a function of a public body to provide.

The sixth function must be conferred by enactment on the Competition and Markets Authority. This function
is:

6. to protect members of the public from business conduct adversely affecting them, to regulate conduct
(or agreements) preventing, restricting or distorting commercial competition, or to regulate
undertakings abusing a dominant market position.

If you process personal data for any of the above functions, you are exempt from the UK GDPR’s provisions
on:

@ the right to be informed;

@ all the other individual rights, except rights related to automated individual decision-making including
profiling; and

rights.

But the exemption only applies to the extent that complying with these provisions would be likely to
prejudice the proper discharge of your functions. If you can comply with these provisions and discharge
your functions as normal, you must do so.

e as controller for the processing of personal data, you reasonably believe that compliance with these
provisions would be incompatible with the special purposes (this must be more than just an
inconvenience);

@ the processing is being carried out with a view to the publication of some journalistic, academic, artistic
or literary material; and

® you reasonably believe that the publication of the material would be in the public interest, taking into
account the special importance of the general public interest in freedom of expression, any specific
public interest in the particular subject, and the potential to harm individuals.

When deciding whether it is reasonable to believe that publication would be in the public interest, you must
(if relevant) have regard to:

e the BBC Editorial Guidelines;

e the Ofcom Broadcasting Code; and

e@ the Editors’ Code of Practice.

We expect you to be able to explain why the exemption is required in each case, and how and by whom

this was considered at the time. The ICO does not have to agree with your view — but we must be satisfied
that you had a reasonable belief.

This is a restriction rather than an exemption. It applies if you process social work data as a local authority
in Scotland (as defined by the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968), and you receive a subject access request
for that data.

It restricts you from disclosing social work data in response to a subject access request if:

e the data came from the Principal Reporter (as defined by the Children’s Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011) in
the course of his statutory duties; and

e@ the individual whom the data is about is not entitled to receive it from the Principal Reporter.

If there is a question as to whether you need to comply with a subject access request in this situation, you
must inform the Principal Reporter within 14 days of the question arising.

You must not disclose the social work data in response to the subject access request unless the Principal
Reporter has told you they think the serious harm test for social work data is not met.

The senior management of an organisation is planning a re-organisation. This is likely to involve
making certain employees redundant, and this possibility is included in management plans. Before the
plans are revealed to the workforce, an employee makes a subject access request. In responding to
that request, the organisation does not have to reveal its plans to make him redundant if doing so
would be likely to prejudice the conduct of the business (perhaps by causing staff unrest before the
management's plans are announced).

injuries he sustained in an accident. The insurance company disputes the seriousness of the injuries
and the amount of compensation it should pay. An internal paper sets out the company’s position on
these matters including the maximum sum it would be willing to pay to avoid the claim going to court.
If the individual makes a subject access request to the insurance company, it would not have to send
him the internal paper - because doing so would be likely to prejudice the negotiations to settle the
claim.

National security and defence

If you are processing personal data to safeguard national security or for defence purposes, there is an
exemption provided for at section 26 of the DPA 2018. You may be able to apply this exemption if you
process data under the UK GDPR.

National security is not specifically defined but it can cover processing for:

@ protection against specific threats, such as from terrorists or hostile states;
@ protection of potential targets even in the absence of specific threats; and

@ international co-operation with other countries.
If the exemption applies, it can exempt you from:

@ any of the data protection principles (except lawfulness requirements);
@ any of the rights of individuals;

® personal data breach reporting;

e international transfers requirements; and

® some of the Commissioner’s duties and enforcement powers.

You must always ensure that your processing is lawful, and that you have a lawful basis under Article 6.
There is no exemption from the requirement to process lawfully.

You must always comply with your general accountability and governance obligations.

If you are processing special category data for national security purposes there is no exemption from
Article 9, but special rules apply. Section 28 of the DPA permits the processing of special category data for
safeguarding national security, provided you ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects.

This is not a blanket exemption. You must be able to show that the exemption from specified data
protection standards is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security. When deciding whether

Immigration exemption

About this guidance

This guidance discusses the immigration exemption in detail. Read it if you have detailed questions not
answered in the guide, or if you need a deeper understanding to help you apply this exemption in practice.
It is aimed at DPOs and those with specific data protection responsibilities in larger organisations.

If you haven't yet read the ‘in brief’ page on the immigration exemption in the Guide to Data Protection,
you should read that first. It introduces this topic and sets out the key points you need to know, along with
practical checklists to help you comply.

What is the immigration exemption?

The exemption outlines specific rights in the UK GDPR which can be restricted if those rights would be likely
to prejudice immigration matters.

The exemption can only be applied by the Secretary of State (including the Home Office and its agencies)
who processes data for the purposes of:

@ the maintenance of effective immigration control; or

@ the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective
immigration control.

It is not available to other controllers, such as employers, universities and the police, who liaise with the
Home Office on immigration matters.

It also requires that the Secretary of State has an immigration exemption policy document in place.

The exemption is set out in Schedule 2 Part 1 Paragraph 4 of the Data Protection Act 2018, and has been
amended by The Data Protection Act 2018 (Amendment of Schedule 2 Exemptions) Regulations 2022. The
amendments came into force on 31 January 2022 in response to a court judgment. The amendments

779


--- New Page 341 ---
Page number: 341
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

introduce further safeguards to the exemption including limiting its use to the Secretary of State, requiring
an immigration exemption policy document, and a requirement to keep records and inform individuals that
the exemption has been used.

In the UK, the right to appeal is an integral part of immigration control. Individuals have the right to have
their immigration applications reviewed and to submit an appeal against an asylum decision or a
deportation order.

You should ensure that you are not undermining this review and appeals system process by using this
exemption. For example, by refusing an individual access to their personal data.

You should only restrict the exercising of a data subject’s rights if the exemption applies and there is a valid
reason to apply it.

Your application of the exemption must be proportionate to the circumstances and you must carefully
consider and document each instance. You should not apply the immigration exemption as a blanket
restriction on the data protection rights of individuals, such as migrants or people who have overstayed
their permission to remain. You should only apply it, if required, when the exercise of those rights is likely
to cause prejudice to effective immigration control. You must apply the exemption on a case by case basis.
You must have regard to your immigration exemption policy document when deciding if the exemption
applies.

Example

An individual seeking asylum in the UK has had their application refused. They make a request to the
Home Office for all their personal data so that they can appeal against this decision.

The Home Office is not investigating the individual and can provide the personal data it holds without
prejudice to its immigration control function. It does not hold any confidential intelligence (a factor
listed for consideration in its immigration exemption policy document) which the individual is unaware
of and it has no reason to withhold any of the requested personal data. It must not use the exemption
to frustrate a lawful appeal.

In these circumstances the exemption does not apply and should not be used. The Home Office should
therefore disclose the information it holds.

There are various immigration offences (eg overstaying leave to remain) and these are usually dealt with
by the administrative removal of the offender rather than through the criminal justice process. Therefore
the ‘crime and taxation’ exemption does not usually apply in circumstances where immigration control is
concerned. However the two exemptions involve similar considerations. Instead of considering prejudice to
the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, the immigration exemption requires you to consider prejudice
to the administrative functions concerning effective immigration control.

 

There is no assumption of criminal proceedings with the immigration exemption, although the section below
considers what happens if an immigration investigation does become a criminal investigation.

 

780

As noted above, this exemption is only available to the Secretary of State, which includes the Home Office
and its agencies, who are engaged in immigration control.

When should this exemption be used?

that giving effect to those rights would be likely to prejudice:

@ the maintenance of effective immigration control; or

@ the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective
immigration control.

The phrase ‘to the extent that’ means that you should not apply the immigration exemption as a blanket
exemption to restrict all of those rights for all the data you hold. Instead, you need to consider the
application of the exemption on a case by case basis, taking into account your immigration exemption
policy document.

the identified immigration purposes. The exemption therefore only applies when the exercise of the specific
right results in the processing of personal data which would be likely to prejudice the identified function.

Therefore the default position of the controller should be to comply with the requirements of the UK GDPR
and the DPA 2018 as far as possible. It highlights the importance of identifying the specific reason for
applying the exemption in each case.

Many of the rights set out in the UK GDPR contain built-in restrictions or exceptions. The expectation is that
you should rely on these more generic built-in restrictions in preference to the immigration exemption, if
they can achieve the same outcome. This is because the immigration exemption (along with the other
exemptions set out in Schedules 2-4 of the DPA 2018) is an exemption for a specific purpose, and can only
be used if applying the usual provisions of the UK GDPR would cause a specific problem.

You should therefore first consider the restrictions to an individual’s rights as laid out in other relevant UK
GDPR articles. For example, you should consider whether an objection to processing is valid under Article
21, or whether you should allow or refuse an individual exercising their right under Article 17.

You should only use the immigration exemption in circumstances where there are no viable alternatives.

Example

An individual with Leave to Remain in the UK applies to the Home Office to have their personal data
erased. The individual is under investigation for an immigration offence.

The personal data held is still necessary for the purpose it was originally collected for, and the Home
Office can rely on Article 17(3)(b) to refuse the request. This is because the right to erasure does not
apply if personal data needs to be retained for:

@ compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which
the controller is subject; or

e@ the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
vested in the controller.

In this case, the restriction of the individual’s rights is accomplished without relying on the immigration
exemption.

What is an immigration exemption policy document?

In order to be able to apply the exemption, the Secretary of State must have an immigration exemption
policy document in place.

The immigration exemption policy document must explain the policies and processes the Secretary of State
(including the Home Office and its agencies) will use to decide how compliance with a provision under the
UK GDPR would be likely to prejudice the carrying out of effective immigration control. For example, it
should describe the factors the organisation will consider when making the decision in each case.

The document must also explain the policies in place to make sure that the use of the immigration
exemption does not allow personal data to be abused, accessed, or transferred in a manner that does not
comply with the UK GDPR.

When considering whether the immigration exemption applies, the Secretary of State must have regard to
the immigration exemption policy document.

The Secretary of State must also:

@ review the immigration exemption policy document and (if necessary) update it from time to time; and

@ publish it.

Further reading

The Home Office has published its immigration exemption policy document here @.

 

What is the prejudice test?

The DPA 2018 does not explain what is meant by ‘would be likely to prejudice’. However, the ICO’s view is
there must be a real and substantial chance of prejudice, rather than just a hypothetical or remote
possibility that complying with the provision would noticeably damage the discharge of the function
concerned.

There should be a causal link between compliance and the prejudice claimed, and you must be able to show
how the exercising of a specific right would be likely to lead to the prejudice. In reaching a decision on this,
you should take into account the immigration exemption policy document. You must make this reasoning
available to the ICO if required.

The prejudice test has a high threshold and you should not apply the exemption in a blanket fashion. It
must be both necessary and proportionate to apply the exemption and you must only apply it to specific
rights where the likelihood of prejudice is present, rather than applying this across the board to all the
rights.

You must consider whether the application of the exemption is a proportionate response. You may consider
that there is a pressing social need to apply the immigration exemption, but you must also take into
account whether this outweighs your obligation to individuals under the UK GDPR. They have rights over
their personal data which you must consider in all circumstances, in particular, the right of access.

It is therefore important in every case that you consider whether the data protection rights of the individual
override the identified risk of prejudice. Your application of the exemption must be proportionate to the
circumstances and you must carefully consider and document each instance.

It is also important to note that prejudice changes over time. While personal data may be withheld during
an ongoing investigation, disclosure of this information is unlikely to present the same risk afterwards.

Therefore, you should keep the immigration exemption under review. You should always consider an
individual’s current circumstances. For example, you should not assume that if you have once refused to
provide a data subject with all their personal data under this exemption, then your response will always
remain the same. Should they submit a new subject access request to you, you should assess whether
circumstances have changed and whether providing the data would now prejudice the maintenance of
effective immigration control. If not, you may be able to respond more fully to this new request.

Example

An individual is suspected of overstaying their student visa in the UK. While an investigation is carried
out, they make a request for all personal data held about them.

783


--- New Page 345 ---
Page number: 345
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

The Home Office may withhold information which, if disclosed, will prejudice the investigation. This
might include information which identifies any proposed actions against the individual.

However the Home Office should not apply a blanket exemption. It could disclose any personal data
relating to the individual’s previous visa application and any other information it holds, unless it can
show that the disclosure will be likely to impact on the ongoing investigation or any expected actions
arising from it.

The individual successfully extends their visa due to extenuating circumstances and is allowed to
remain in the UK for another two years. They make another request for their personal data.

The Home Office will have to carefully consider this, taking into account the guidance set out in the
immigration exemption policy document. As there are no active proceedings against the individual, the
exemption will only continue to be available if there is any remaining prejudice to immigration controls,
and the Home Office should not use it simply because it applied previously.

Although the immigration exemption may no longer apply in this context, other exemptions under
Schedule 2 of the DPA 2018 may be relevant.

What rights does the immigration exemption apply to?

The exemption applies to the following rights:

@ right to be informed;

@ right of access;

@ right to erasure;

e right to restrict processing; and

@ right to object.

The exemption does not restrict other data subject rights. More information is available in our UK GDPR

Example

An individual being investigated for an immigration offence contacts the Home Office to request that
their date of birth is rectified, as this is inaccurately reflected in their records.

The right to rectification is not a right which is restricted under this exemption. The Home Office must
therefore update their records and respond to the individual within the time frame permitted.

How does the exemption affect the individual’s right to be informed?

The right to be informed means that the data subject has the right to be given certain privacy information
about the processing of their data. This includes for example, the purposes of the processing and the
identity and contact details of the controller. This applies whether you obtain personal data from the
individual or from someone else.

The provision of this privacy information also meets the transparency requirement of Article 5(a).

However, if you are investigating an individual, you may not wish to tell them that you are processing their
personal data for the purposes of immigration control. This would alert them to your investigation, and
would be likely to prejudice the purpose of the processing.

In these circumstances, you may apply the immigration exemption and restrict the individual’s right to be
informed. You do not have to provide privacy information if this is likely to prejudice the identified
immigration purposes.

As discussed above, the immigration exemption also provides an exemption from the data protection
principles so far as their provisions correspond to the listed data subject rights. Therefore in these
circumstances, it provides an exemption from the transparency requirement of Article 5(a) to the extent
that this corresponds with the right to be informed.

However, although you may therefore be exempt from providing privacy information to the individual you
are investigating, you still have to comply with the other requirements of Article 5(a) and identify a lawful
basis for processing. This lawfulness part of Article 5(a) does not affect (or correspond to) any of the rights
listed above and so you are not exempt from this particular obligation.

How does the exemption affect the individual’s right of access?

An individual may make a subject access request to you, in order to obtain a copy of the data you hold
about them. You must consider the circumstances of each case and may apply the exemption only if you
consider that to comply with the right of access would be likely to prejudice effective immigration control.

You may not wish to provide a copy of all the personal data you hold, if this would prejudice a current
investigation into that individual’s immigration status, or would otherwise prejudice the maintenance of
effective immigration controls. However, you may be able to provide some personal data in response to the

785


--- New Page 347 ---
Page number: 347
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

request, if this does not prejudice your investigation.

Example

An individual who has been refused entry to the UK at an airport e-Passport gate makes a Subject
Access Request to the Home Office, asking for information about why their entry was refused.

Providing the individual with this information would involve disclosing details about the technical
operation of the e-Passport gates, which if made public, could have a detrimental effect on border
control, potentially enabling attempts to undermine the system.

In this case, the Home Office may legitimately rely on the immigration exemption as a reason to refuse
to disclose the requested information.

Do we need to inform individuals that the immigration exemption has been applied?

You should keep a record of the decision to apply the immigration exemption, and your reasoning, each
time it is applied. Individuals should be informed that the immigration exemption has been applied unless it
would be prejudicial to effective immigration control to do so. See ‘What is the prejudice test?’ for guidance
on how to assess whether an individual being informed that the immigration exemption has been used
would be prejudicial to carrying out immigration control.

Example

An individual seeking asylum in the UK has had their application refused. They make a request to the
Home Office for all their personal data so that they can appeal against this decision.

The Home Office is investigating them for the use of identification which does not belong to them and it
would prejudice the investigation to provide them with the personal data relating to this investigation.

The Home Office therefore may apply this exemption in order to restrict the individual’s right of access.
However it should provide as much data as it can and inform the individual where the immigration
exemption has been applied, if this does not prejudice the investigation.

What happens if an immigration investigation becomes a criminal investigation?

If the investigation of an immigration offence develops into a criminal investigation, and if you are a
competent authority processing personal data for the purposes of law enforcement, you should undertake
processing under Part 3 of the DPA 2018, rather than under the UK GDPR regime. Personal data has to be

786


--- New Page 348 ---
Page number: 348
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

handled according to the requirements laid out in Part 3, which has its own restrictions about the rights of
individuals. More information is available in our guide to law enforcement processing.

 

Example

The Home Office is investigating an individual for an immigration offence. Investigations show that they
were involved in the trafficking of individuals into forced labour in the UK. The Home Office now has to
investigate under Part 3 of the DPA 2018 as a criminal offence.

Should the individual choose to exercise any of their data protection rights, the Home Office will have
to consider these under the requirements of Part 3 of the DPA 2018 and apply restrictions accordingly.

National security and defence

At a glance

e@ In order to safeguard national security or for defence purposes there is an exemption provided for at
section 26 of the DPA. It is capable of exempting personal data from most of the data protection
principles and obligations, and individuals rights, where this is required to safeguard national security or
for defence purposes.

@ This guidance only considers the national security aspects of this exemption. In the future, the ICO will
develop additional content on the defence aspects of this exemption, and will publish an amended
version of this guidance in due course.

@ You may be able to apply this exemption if you process data under the UK GDPR.

e@ This is not a blanket exemption. You must be able to show that the exemption from specified data
protection standards is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security. When deciding
whether to use this exemption, we suggest you consider whether complying with the UK GDPR would
raise a real possibility of an adverse effect on national security.

@ A Minister of the Crown (specifically a member of the Cabinet, the Attorney General or the Advocate
General for Scotland) can issue a certificate which covers your processing in relation to national security.
If you have decided that it is necessary to rely on the exemption, you can rely on this certificate as
conclusive proof that the exemption applies. However, you should not assume that you must apply the
exemption, simply because a certificate has been issued. We will publish details of relevant certificates.

@ You must always have a lawful basis under Article 6, and show that your processing is more generally
lawful. There is no exemption from the requirement to process lawfully.

@ You must always comply with your general accountability and governance obligations.

e Modified rules apply to how you process special category data and to your security obligations.

Checklist for using the exemption

Does this guidance apply to us?

This guidance applies to you if you usually process data under the UK GDPR, and you are carrying out
processing for national security purposes.

If you are a “competent authority” processing for law enforcement purposes related to national security,
different provisions apply and you should read our Guide to law enforcement processing. However, if you
are also processing data for a non-law enforcement purpose this guidance applies.

 

The intelligence services (or processors acting on their behalf) are covered by a separate regime. For more
information, see our Guide to intelligence services processing.

About the DPA 2018
What does “national security” cover?

“National security” is not specifically defined and can be interpreted in a flexible way to adapt to changing
threats. Thirty years ago, it would have been difficult or even impossible to predict the threats that
developments in computer and communications technology could give rise to, or how such developments

789


--- New Page 351 ---
Page number: 351
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

could be exploited by terrorists or hostile states. It is generally understood to cover the security and
well-being of the UK as a whole, its population, and its institutions and system of government. For
example, it can cover:

@ protection against specific threats, such as from terrorists or hostile states;

@ protection of potential targets even in the absence of specific threats; and

@ international co-operation with other countries.

What is the national security exemption?

Section 26 of the DPA 2018 sets out a broad exemption from specified provisions of the UK GDPR:

66

“...if exemption from the provision is required for—

(a) the purpose of safeguarding national security, or
(b) defence purposes.”

This guidance only focuses on the national security element of this exemption.
If the exemption applies, it can exempt you from:

@ any of the data protection principles (except lawfulness requirements);
@ any of the rights of individuals;

® personal data breach reporting;

@ international transfers requirements; and

© some of the Commissioner’s duties and enforcement powers.
You must always ensure that your processing is lawful, and that you have a lawful basis under Article 6.

If you are processing special category data for national security purposes there is no exemption from
Article 9, but special rules apply. Section 28 of the DPA permits the processing of special category data for
safeguarding national security, provided you ensure there are appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects. For more information on this see What are the special rules for special category
data? below.

 

If you are processing criminal offence data, and can apply this exemption, you are also exempt from your
obligations under article 10 of the UK GDPR.

You must always comply with your accountability and governance obligations, including the requirement to
be able to demonstrate compliance (Article 5(2) of the UK GDPR).

Although there is no exemption from security obligations, modified provisions apply to data processed for
national security purposes. For more information on this see How are our security obligations affected?
below.

e Lawful basis for processing

e Accountability and governance

How does the exemption work?

Given the importance of national security, you can apply this exemption to a greater number of provisions
than many other exemptions.

The exemption applies if it is “required” to safeguard national security. In this context, “required” means
that the use of the exemption is “reasonably necessary”. This is linked to human rights standards. This
means that any interference with privacy rights should be necessary and proportionate in a democratic
society to meet a pressing social need.

The exemption is capable of being applied to a large number of the data protection provisions. However, it
is not a blanket exemption and national security will not automatically override individual rights. You should
consider your use of the exemption on a case-by-case basis.

In particular, it is not enough that the data is processed for national security purposes. You must consider
the actual consequences to national security if you had to comply with the particular UK GDPR provision. If
you can reasonably comply with the provision without affecting national security, you must. Of course, this
is subject to any other exemptions that might apply in the specific circumstances.

You don’t need to show that compliance would lead to a direct or immediate harm or threat. It is enough to
show that there is a real possibility of an adverse effect on national security in a broader sense. For
example, in freedom of information cases, courts have recognised that terrorists can be highly motivated.
There may therefore be grounds for withholding seemingly harmless information on the basis that it may
assist terrorists when pieced together with other information.

If you use the exemption, you should be able to make a reasoned and convincing argument about the risks
of compliance with the UK GDPR provisions. You may base these on hypothetical scenarios, as long as they
are still realistic and credible.

For example, you may need to use the exemption to provide a consistent “neither confirm nor deny”
(NCND) response about whether you process data for national security purposes. This may even be in a
case where there is no direct impact on national security. This is so that nothing can be inferred in other
cases which might have more of an impact on national security.

You can apply this type of NCND response as a general policy. However, you should be able to make a
reasoned argument about its use and demonstrate it to the ICO, if required. You should still consider
whether there are any special circumstances which mean you don’t need to rely on the general NCND policy
in a particular case.

Instead of an NCND response, you could also give a different form of non-committal response. There may
be circumstances when it is not appropriate to inform a person that you are relying on the national security
exemption and you may wish to word your response appropriately.

Example

An organisation is concerned that some of its service users are at risk of radicalisation from extremist
groups. It passes details of individuals it considers may have been approached or are at risk to the
relevant authorities.

A group of service users make subject access requests to the organisation. They ask specific questions
about whether their details have ever been “passed to the authorities”. The service users have
announced publicly on social media that they intend to share their responses with each other.

The organisation has informed the relevant authorities about some members of the group of service
users, but not others. It is concerned that if radicalised individuals become aware that their details
have been shared, it may damage national security, put lives in danger and they may take steps to
thwart surveillance or other monitoring of their actions.

The organisation must respond to the subject access requests, but can use the exemption to avoid
revealing any information about whether or not it has referred details to relevant authorities. It can
omit the relevant details from the information it does provide. It can also provide a non-committal
response to any direct question about disclosures to the authorities, regardless of whether or not the
referral has in fact taken place.

Further reading — ICO guidance

The courts have considered a very similar exemption in the context of freedom of information requests.
For more information, see our guidance on the FOI exemption for safeguarding national security.

 

When is the exemption likely to apply?

You can use the exemption if you can show that complying with the relevant rule would be incompatible
with safeguarding national security.

You can also use the exemption to maintain a consistent line so that individuals cannot draw inferences
which might harm national security in other cases. For example, giving a non-committal response to
subject access requests about national security processing. You do not have to confirm that you are relying
on the exemption or give any details which allow an individual to infer that additional information is in fact
processed.

Example

792


--- New Page 354 ---
Page number: 354
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

A company is concerned that some of its customers may be using its products to make bombs. It
decides to provide MI5 with information about these customers and their purchases.

A customer makes a subject access request to the company for their personal data, along with details
of the processing. The company should comply with the usual UK GDPR rules on the right of access in
the normal way for the processing it does for its own business purposes. However, it is likely to be able
to use the national security and defence exemption to avoid giving any information about the
disclosures to MI5. In this case, alerting a suspected bomb-maker to the fact that MI5 is aware of their
activities would clearly raise a real risk to MI5’s ability to effectively safeguard national security.

If the customer makes a request for erasure of their data, the company can delete its ordinary
customer records as usual but rely on the exemption to avoid deleting the data shared with MI5. It
could also rely on the exemption to avoid informing the customer that it had not deleted all of the data.

You cannot use the exemption if the impact of compliance would be trivial or is not linked to national
security (eg to avoid embarrassment).

You cannot use the exemption in a blanket way just because you process data for national security
purposes. You must be able to show some link between compliance with the specific provision and the need
to safeguard national security, even if that link is indirect. If necessary, we would expect you to be able to
provide us with evidence about why you used this exemption.

What is a ministerial certificate?

Section 27 of the DPA says that a Minister of the Crown (specifically a member of the Cabinet, the Attorney
General or the Advocate General for Scotland) can sign a certificate which is conclusive evidence that the
exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.

It is important to remember that you do not require a certificate in order to rely on the national security
exemption. In fact, in most cases, controllers will determine for themselves whether they require an
exemption to safeguard national security. It is also important to note that there are no certificates for
relying on this exemption for defence purposes.

The exemption and the ministerial certificate do different things. The exemption, as detailed above, is
always available. You may properly apply it to safeguard national security, with or without a ministerial
certificate. Ministerial certificates are meant to give greater legal certainty that national security is
applicable for specified data processing. This is because it certifies that an exemption is required for
specified personal data to safeguard national security.

In this context, a ministerial certificate is admissible as conclusive evidence that exemption from the
specific provision listed in section 26 is required to safeguard national security.

These certificates can be issued in advance or retrospectively. The personal data to which the certificate
applies may be identified in general terms.

The ICO will publish some details of all national security certificates which have been issued, including the
text of the certificate where possible. However, there may be some cases where the text of the certificate is
sensitive and cannot be published. In these cases, we will publish the fact that a certificate was issued, the

793


--- New Page 355 ---
Page number: 355
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

date it was signed, and which minister signed it.

If a relevant certificate is in place, you can rely on it to demonstrate that the exemption applies. However,
you should still consider whether you actually need to rely on the exemption, and the certificate, in a
particular case. You may need to check with the relevant authorities whether or not you should rely on a
certificate.

If you consider that a certificate is required, you can apply to a Minister of the Crown to issue a national
security certificate under section 27. Details of the process for doing this are on the Home Office website,
and linked to from the National security certificate page of the ICO website.

 

For more information on ministerial certificates, see the Guide to intelligence services processing.

National security certificates on the ICO website

 

What are the special rules for special category data?

Section 28 of the DPA 2018 modifies the rules on special category data for the purpose of safeguarding
national security.

You may not always need to identify an Article 9 condition for that element of your processing as long as
you have “appropriate safeguards” in place to protect individuals’ rights and freedoms. This reflects the
substantial public interest in national security. However, you still need to ensure you have an Article 6
lawful basis for your processing.

The DPA does not specify how you can demonstrate that you have appropriate safeguards in place - so it is
your responsibility to identify a reasonable way to do so.

This document should briefly outline:

@ how you have met the lawfulness requirements of principle (a) — including which lawful basis you are
relying upon;

® your retention and deletion policies; and

® an indication of the retention period for the specific data.

If you already have an appropriate policy document for the processing of special category data, you may
wish to include the details about your security processing in it.

It is good practice to retain these details until six months after the date you stop this processing. You must
keep it under review. You do not have to publish it, although it is good practice to do so (although it may
not be appropriate to do so for national security reasons).

How are our security obligations affected?

794


--- New Page 356 ---
Page number: 356
Title of ebook of origin: 46.guide_to_gdpr.pdf

Section 28 also modifies the security obligations placed on a controller. So, slightly different security
obligations apply if you are processing for the purpose of safeguarding national security.

You must implement security measures appropriate to the risks arising from your processing. There are
also specific additional requirements for any electronic data. You must evaluate the risks, and implement
specific measures to:

@ prevent unauthorised processing or interference with your electronic systems;

® ensure that you can establish the details of any processing which takes place (ie there is an electronic
audit trail);

® ensure proper functioning and restoration of the system; and

@ ensure that data will not be corrupted if a system malfunctions.

What about law enforcement processing?

If you are a competent authority processing for law enforcement purposes, different rules apply under Part
3 of the DPA 2018.

There is no equivalent broad exemption to safeguard national security for law enforcement processing. The
usual principles and obligations apply. However, there are some restrictions built-in to some of the rights of
data subjects, and some of the provisions about reporting data breaches. These can apply where necessary
and proportionate to protect national security. A Minister can sign a certificate as conclusive evidence that
these restrictions apply, in a similar way to the UK GDPR exemption.

enforcement processing.

 

For more information on processing by the intelligence services themselves and the equivalent exemption
in Part 4 of the DPA 2018, see the Guide to intelligence services processing.

Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA

Appeal against an ET's ruling that the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of
contract and failure to pay notice pay were well founded. Appeal dismissed.

The Claimant was dismissed for gross misconduct (physical violence) after he grabbed a
colleague by the neck. He won his claims of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure
to pay notice pay. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Respondent
was not one that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. Further, the Tribunal found that no
reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper regard to all of the
circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to what is just and equitable in
all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the Claimant contributed to his own
dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent. The Respondent appealed.

The EAT dismissed the appeal. The Respondent had erred in not having regard to all of
the circumstances, including the Claimant's exemplary record. The EAT also ruled that
there was no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per cent.

For the Respondent
Written Submissions

**SUMMARY**
UNFAIR DISMISSAL - Reasonableness of dismissal

The Employment Tribunal found the Respondent's complaints of unfair dismissal and
breach of contract to be well founded. The Appellant's primary ground of appeal that the
Employment Tribunal substituted its own view for that of the Appellant failed, as did the
contention that the Employment Tribunal reached a perverse decision. The Employment
Tribunal misapplied the decision in [Ramphal v Department for Transport ]()[2015] IRLR
985 and it is not clear from the Decision whether the Employment Tribunal accepted that
physical violence amounted to gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's
disciplinary procedure. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed the unfair dismissal
appeal: physical violence amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary
procedures, but the Appellant failed to have regard to all the surrounding circumstances
and the Claimant's exemplary disciplinary record over 42 years. The appeal against the
breach of contract claim was also dismissed.

**THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SUPPERSTONE**

 

1. The Appellant, Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd, appeals against the Judgment of an
Employment Tribunal (Employment Judge Johnson), sent to the parties on 28
January 2016 following a hearing held at North Shields on 21 December 2015, that
the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure to pay
notice pay are well founded and succeed. Mr Morgan appears for the Appellant; the
Claimant is not represented or present, but he has submitted written
representations which we have read and taken into account.

1. The Appellant is primarily an automotive retailer, with over 200 branches throughout
the UK. The company also provides hire, drive and insurance services. Its services
generally include sales, service and bodyshop departments. It has approximately
10,000 employees and has a specific HR facility comprising 15 staff across offices
in Glasgow and Manchester. The Claimant worked at the Appellant's Penn Street,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne branch. He is a Motor Vehicle Technician with over 42 years’
continuous service with the Appellant.

1. The claims arise out of the Appellant's dismissal of the Claimant on 6 May 2015 for
reasons related to his conduct. The alleged conduct was physical violence towards
another employee. The Claimant had admitted grabbing the other employee but
denied any physical violence. The Appellant's disciplinary procedures that are
relevant to the Claimant's complaint include the following (as quoted at paragraph
3.5 of the Decision):

"1.0 Informal procedure

1.1 Minor shortcomings in meeting the requirements of your job will be brought to
your attention informally by the person to whom you are primarily responsible. If
however formal steps are necessary the following will apply.

2.0 Guidelines for the conduct of formal disciplinary meetings

2.1 Disciplinary action will normally be taken by the person to whom you report but
circumstances may warrant someone else being involved, for example where your
line manager is not available or he or she is involved in the complaint.

3.0 Implementation of the disciplinary policy

3.3 The persons conducting the interview will decide what (if any) disciplinary
measures to apply whilst taking into account the circumstances and your previous
record."

1. Section 4, headed "Disciplinary actions", sets out disciplinary sanctions that may be
imposed. Section 5, headed "Summary dismissal", states:

"5.1 You will normally be dismissed with immediate effect and without notice or
payment in lieu of notice in cases of gross misconduct. ..."

Examples of gross misconduct given include physical violence.

1. The Claimant reported directly to the Workshop Controller, John French, and the
Service Manager, Tom Middleton. The incident that formed the subject matter of the
disciplinary proceedings taken against the Claimant occurred on 27 April 2015
(paragraph 3.8):

"3.8. ... One of the apprentices, Kieran Chapman, was having some difficulty in
operating a printer in the computer room. The claimant thought he could identify the
problem and suggested that the paper drawer should be opened to see if the paper
had jammed. The claimant suggested that more paper should be put into the drawer.
Kieran insisted that extra paper was not required. The claimant momentarily lost his
temper, accused Kieran of not listening to him and, using both hands, grabbed
Kieran in the vicinity of his neck. The words used by Kieran in the investigation
were, "The next think [sic] | know he's got his hands round my neck". When asked
in the investigation how long the claimant had his hands round his neck, Kieran
replied, "Just a couple of seconds". Kieran then said, "I pushed him off and then he
told us to get my hands off him and | didn't have my hand on him like"."

799

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

1. When the Claimant was interviewed, he said that he may have caught his throat but
he did not have him by the throat. The following morning the Claimant approached
Mr Chapman and apologised to him for his actions. Mr Chapman had already
reported the incident to Mr Middleton. Later in the day both of them were called into
Mr Middleton's office. They went over the details of the incident. Mr Middleton
informed them that he had decided not to proceed with any formal disciplinary
action but that he intended to issue the Claimant with a "letter of concern”, in
accordance with the Appellant's informal procedure. The Claimant again apologised
to Mr Chapman, confirming that he knew that he was in the wrong and should not
have done what he had done. They shook hands and both returned to work.

1. On the same day a copy of the letter was sent by Mr French to Liz Kilshaw in the
Appellant's HR Department. In substance it read:

"Had some handbags between two guys here and we will be issuing David [the
Claimant] with this letter. A copy for your records."

1. The Tribunal found that the use of the word "handbags" is a local colloquialism for
something understood to be a petty and insignificant disagreement. When Ms
Kilshaw received Mr French's message and a copy of the letter of concern, she
spoke to Mr French and established that there had been an allegation of what she
considered to be physical violence, specifically that the Claimant was alleged to
have grabbed Mr Chapman by the throat. Ms Kilshaw decided that a formal
investigation was required. Having interviewed the Claimant, Mr Chapman and
other employees, Ms Kilshaw suspended the Claimant pending a formal disciplinary
hearing. A letter was sent to the Claimant on 30 April, which ends by stating:

"You should be aware that the company considers this to be a matter amounting to
gross misconduct and a potential outcome of this meeting is your dismissal without
notice."

1. The Claimant attended a disciplinary hearing on 6 May, which was conducted by
Laura Fowler of HR and Mr French. At the end of the disciplinary hearing, after a
short retirement, Ms Fowler said:

",.. So you have confirmed obviously that you grabbed Kieran by the kind of the
collar area which may have been perceived as the neck area. You are not too sure as
to why you lost your temper and obviously afterwards you've realised kind of what
you've done and apologised to Kieran. Based on the facts established throughout
the disciplinary meeting we have decided the outcome of today's meeting will be
dismissal without notice, ok. ... Just to clarify the reason why we've come to this
decision is the physical violence, we couldn't accept it of any nature at all within the
business. ... we deem any form of any physical violence as unacceptable ..."

1. Ms Fowler gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted at paragraph 3.21
of the Decision:

"3.21. ... Ms Fowler insisted that the claimant's length of service and previous good
character were not matters to which she should have any regard whatsoever. ..."

800

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

1. The Claimant had over 42 years’ continuous service with the Appellant, and
throughout that time he had an exemplary disciplinary record. Ms Fowler also
insisted that "as a matter of policy we cannot tolerate physical violence". She
insisted that the Appellant operates a "zero tolerance policy" towards physical
violence. The Judge noted that Ms Fowler further refused to acknowledge that
allegations such as these must be seen and taken in the context of all of the
surrounding circumstances at the relevant time. She did not consider it appropriate
to undertake any assessment as to the level or degree of physical violence.

1. The Claimant appealed the decision to dismiss him, and on 25 June Ms Louise
Pheasey, Senior HR Adviser, conducted an appeal hearing. After the hearing Ms
Pheasey undertook further interviews with two employees who had previously given
statements and Mr French. She then issued her letter dismissing the Claimant's
appeal on 9 July without referring back to the Claimant. She dismissed all of the
Claimant's grounds of appeal. In her letter dismissing the appeal she said:

",.. [uphold that this was classed as physical violence which is listed in the
company disciplinary procedure as an issue of gross misconduct and therefore the
outcome of summary dismissal on this basis was fair and reasonable in the
circumstances."

1. Ms Pheasey gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted that when asked
whether grabbing someone by the collar should be regarded as very much towards
the lower end of physical violence, she said she saw no reason to make any
differentiation. She too insisted that the Appellant operated a zero tolerance policy
towards any incident of physical violence and that any such incident would
inevitably result in Summary dismissal. She accepted that there may well be
circumstances where an employee involved in an act of physical violence will not be
dismissed but insisted that this case was not one of those. An example given was
where an employee reacted to provocation that amounted to sexual harassment or
racial discrimination. That was not this case, and, that being so, the surrounding
circumstances and the Claimant's record were not taken into account.

1. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Appellant was not one
that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. No attempt was made to discuss the
matter with Mr French and Mr Middleton, and in particular to obtain from them their
assessment as to the seriousness of the incident itself. Further, the Tribunal found
that no reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper
regard to all of the circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to
what is just and equitable in all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the
Claimant contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent.

1. Mr Morgan advances four grounds of appeal. The Appellant's primary ground is that
the Tribunal fell into error by impermissibly substituting its own view for that of the
Appellant or at the very least the Tribunal substituted the views of the other
managers, Mr French and Mr Middleton, who had considered the Claimant's

801

misconduct at an earlier stage. In support of the submission the Appellant pointed in
particular to four passages in the Judgment: first, at paragraph 12, the Judge stated:

"12. ... The Tribunal saw no evidence from the respondents [sic] to contradict their
original assessment of the incident as "handbags". ..."

1. Secondly, at paragraph 13 the Judge stated:

"13. ... The Tribunal found that the subsequent investigation, disciplinary and
appeal process were [sic] tainted by Ms Fowler's and Ms Pheasey's exaggerated
interpretation of the facts. ..."

1. Thirdly, at paragraph 14 the Judge stated:

"14. ... Whilst some may consider it offensive, it could reasonably only be
categorised as mildly so. ..."

1. Fourthly, at paragraph 3.26 the Judge said:

"3.26. ... When asked whether she had taken into account the claimant's length of
service and good record, Ms Pheasey somewhat alarmingly said that she had done
so..."

1. We do not accept that the Tribunal substituted its own views for those of the
Appellant's decision makers. Paragraph 14 of the Judgment makes it clear, in our
view, that it was the decision of Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey that the Tribunal
subjected to scrutiny and analysis, correctly applying the "no reasonable employer"
test.

1. The second ground of appeal is that the Tribunal misdirected itself in applying the
guidance of this Tribunal set out in the case of Ramphal v Department for
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 when considering the role of Human Resources in the
Appellant's disciplinary process. At paragraph 13 of the Decision it is stated:

"13. The Tribunal found that this was one of those cases where the HR officers
involved had unreasonably and improperly imposed their own assumptions and
Opinions, in circumstances where their involvement was, in the view of those best
placed to decide, simply not required. ..."

1. We agree with Mr Morgan that this is a misapplication of the Ramphal decision, the
essence of which the Tribunal correctly records at paragraph 8 of its Judgment. Ms
Fowler and Ms Pheasey were the actual decision makers in this case. Accordingly,
the principle enunciated in Ramphal has no application to the facts of the present
case.

1. The third ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as to
whether the Claimant's behaviour amounted to gross misconduct or not. It is said
that at paragraphs 14 and 15 the Tribunal conflated its findings on the scale of the
act of misconduct (physical violence) on the one hand with its apparent view of the
mitigating circumstances (apology, risk to others, stressful circumstances, previous
employment record) on the other. Applying the Meek v City of Birmingham District
Council [1987] IRLR 250 test, it is said that the Appellant does not know why it lost

 

802

the case. There is, we think, some force in this criticism. The Tribunal found at
paragraph 16 of the Decision that this was a minor, trivial incident that could not
reasonably be categorised as the fundamental breach of contract by the Claimant.
Admittedly, this was said in the context of considering the breach of contract claim;
however, it is not clear from what is said at paragraphs 14 to 16 read as a whole
whether the Tribunal is accepting the physical violence in this case amounts to
gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.

1. Finally, the Appellant contends that the Tribunal acted perversely in that this was a
decision that no reasonable Tribunal properly directing itself on the law could have
reached. We do not accept that the Tribunal reached a perverse decision, for the
reasons that we shall explain. At the conclusion of the oral submissions we invited
Mr Morgan to address us on disposal of the appeal if we concluded (1) that he had
satisfied us that there were errors in the Tribunal Judgment, (2) that we were of the
view that there was gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure,
but (3) we were of the view that the dismissal was unfair because the Appellant had
proceeded on the basis of a zero tolerance policy and had not taken into account all
of the circumstances including the Claimant's employment record. Mr Morgan
acknowledged that if that was our view we would be entitled to deal with the appeal
without the need for remission to an Employment Tribunal.

1. We have reached the conclusion that there are errors in the Tribunal Decision that
we have identified. We are further of the view that there was physical violence that
amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.
However, it is clear to us that Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey proceeded on the basis
that in this case because there was gross misconduct the Claimant was to be
dismissed. There was no evidence that the Appellant did operate a zero tolerance
policy towards physical violence. Indeed, the Appellant's disciplinary procedure is
expressly stated in terms to the contrary. The use of the word "normally" in
paragraph 5.1 indicates that the Appellant has a discretion to exercise. In our
judgment, the Appellant erred in not having regard to all of the circumstances,
including the Claimant's exemplary record. We are satisfied, having regard to the
findings made by the Tribunal, which are not challenged, that by reason of the
Appellant's failure to have regard to all of the surrounding circumstances the
dismissal of the Claimant was unfair.

1. In the alternative, the Appellant contends that the Claimant contributed 100 per cent
to his own dismissal and that in deciding that he only contributed to his dismissal to
the extent of 50 per cent the Tribunal acted perversely. We reject this submission.
There is, in our view, no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per
cent.

1. For the reasons we have given, this appeal is dismissed; both the appeal in relation
to the finding of unfair dismissal and in relation to the breach of contract claim.

Arnold Clark
Automobiles Ltd v Spoor
— dismissal of employee
for physical violence
against a colleague was
unfair

805

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

 

In the case of Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (“EAT”) held that the Employment Tribunal had not erred in finding that the dismissal
of an employee for physical violence against another employee was unfair, as there was no error
of law in the Tribunal’s decision.

Mr Spoor commenced employment with Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd (“Arnold Clark”) in
1973 and was, at the times relevant to this case, a Motor Vehicle Technician.

On 27 April 2015 Mr Spoor momentarily lost his temper with a colleague over a minor issue and
placed his hands on the colleague’s neck for a couple of seconds. This incident was reported by
the colleague to his line manager, Mr French and Mr Spoor was interviewed by Mr French. In this
interview Mr Spoor admitted that he may have caught his colleague’s throat but contended that
he had not grabbed his colleague by the throat. On 28 April 2015 Mr Spoor approached his
colleague to apologise for his actions and, later in the day, both Mr Spoor and his colleague were
called by Mr Middleton (the Service Manager) to a meeting to discuss the incident. Mr Middleton
informed Mr Spoor that he had decided not to take any formal disciplinary action regarding the
incident but that he intended to issue Mr Spoor with a “letter of concern”, in line with Arnold

806

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

Clark’s informal procedure. Mr Spoor again apologised to his colleague and confirmed that he
knew that he was in the wrong and should not have done what he did. Mr Spoor and his
colleague shook hands and they both returned to work.

On 28 April 2015 Mr French sent a copy of the “letter of concern” to Ms Kilshaw (Human
Resources). Mr French confirmed that there had been “some handbags”, that a copy of the “letter
of concern” would be issued to Mr Spoor, and that he was sending this to Ms Kilshaw for her
records. Upon the receipt of Mr French’s email Ms Kilshaw became concerned that there had
been an incident of physical violence, and decided that a formal investigation of the incident
was required. Ms Kilshaw therefore interviewed Mr Spoor, Mr Chapman, and other colleagues,
and suspended Mr Spoor pending a formal disciplinary hearing. On 30 April 2015 Ms Kilshaw
sent Mr Spoor a letter stating that an outcome of the hearing may be dismissal.

On 6 May 2015 Mr Spoor attended a hearing. Mr French and Ms Fowler (Human Resources) also
attended the hearing. At the end of the hearing Ms Fowler confirmed that Mr Spoor would be
dismissed for gross misconduct as “...we deem any form of physical violence as unacceptable...”.
She also stated that the company had a “zero tolerance policy” to physical violence and did not
consider it appropriate to undertake a review of the context of the incident, including Mr Spoor’s
length of service (42 years), his exemplary disciplinary record, and the level or degree of physical
violence.

Mr Spoor appealed the decision to dismiss him but this was rejected. Mr Spoor made a claim to
the Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal, and this came to a full
hearing on 21 December 2015. The Employment Tribunal found that the investigation
undertaken by Arnold Clark was not reasonable in the circumstances as no attempt was made to
discuss the matter with Mr French or Middleton and, in particular, to obtain their view of the
seriousness of the incident. Further, the Tribunal also found that no reasonable employer would
have dismissed in the circumstances, having proper regard to all of the circumstances including
his length of service and previous record. The Tribunal did, however, find that Mr Spoor
contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 percent.

Arnold Clark appealed against this decision on four grounds, including that the Tribunal had
impermissibly substituted its own view for that of Arnold Clark (“the First Ground”), that the
Tribunal had misdirected itself by applying the guidance in the case of Ramphal v Department of
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 (“the Second Ground”), that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as
to whether Mr Spoor’s behaviour constituted gross misconduct (“the Third Ground”), and that
the Tribunal had acted perversely as this was not a decision that any reasonable Tribunal
properly directly itself on the law could have reached (“the Fourth Ground”).

The Employment Appeal Tribunal rejected the First Ground and Fourth Grounds of appeal but
found that Arnold Clark’s appeals on the Second Ground Third Ground had some merit, as,
respectively, Ramphal was not applicable in the circumstances and the Tribunal had failed to
give specific reasons as to whether they had found Mr Spoor’s behaviour to be gross misconduct
under Arnold Clark’s disciplinary policy. However, the EAT found that the merits of these grounds
of appeal were not sufficient to merit the upholding of the appeal, as the EAT were satisfied that
Arnold Clark had failed to take into account all the circumstances (including Mr Spoor’s
exemplary service and the seriousness of the incident) when reaching its decision to dismiss.

807

Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

The EAT also dismissed an argument that Mr Spoor had contributed to his own dismissal to the
extent of 100 percent.

The EAT therefore rejected Arnold Clark’s appeal.

Chris Hadrill, a specialist employment solicitor at Redmans, commented on the case: “This case
shows that employers must carefully apply their disciplinary policy and take into account all of
the circumstances of the case before making any decision to dismiss - a failure to do so may
render any decision to dismiss unfair.”

Analysis of the Use of a Modular Approach in Software Engineering Across
Software Engineering Books

1.

- Discusses different design approaches for software architecture, mentioning that an application doesn't need to stick with a single
architecture and can mix different design approaches, implying a modular design.

- Highlights the decomposition process in the V-Model, aligning with modular design principles by breaking the application down into
manageable pieces.

In the book "Beginning Software Engineering,” the concept of a modular approach, while not explicitly labeled as "modular approach,” is
discussed in the context of software architecture and design. Here are the relevant sections:

High-Level Design (Page 100): The book discusses different design approaches for software architecture. It mentions that an
application doesn't need to stick with a single architecture and can mix different design approaches. Specifically, it states, "Some of the
larger services might use a component-based approach to break their code into decoupled pieces." This is a principle of modular design,
where software is divided into separate modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

V-Model (Page 275): In the context of the V-Model, the book discusses decomposition, which is the process of breaking the application
down from its highest conceptual level into more and more detailed tasks. This concept aligns with modular design as it involves dividing
software into smaller, manageable pieces.

Although the term "modular approach" is not used directly, the principles of modular design are implied in the discussions of component-
based approaches and the decomposition process. The book emphasizes the importance of breaking down software into manageable,
decoupled pieces, which is a core aspect of modular design.

2. "Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Fourth Edition" by Rajib Mall:

- Explicitly discusses modularity, stating that a modular design effectively decomposes a problem into a set of modules with limited
interactions.

- Emphasizes the importance of high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules as characteristics of a highly
modular design solution.

- Advocates for modular design to improve understandability, reusability, and manageability of software.

In the book "Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Fourth Edition" by Rajib Mall, the modular approach is explicitly discussed in several
sections:

Definition of Module (Page 65): The book defines a module as "a collection of procedures and data structures... forming an
independently compilable unit" that can be linked with other modules to form a complete application. This definition underlines the
concept of modularity in software engineering.

Modularity and Design (Page 627): The book elaborates on the concepts of modularity, stating that "A modular design is an effective
decomposition of a problem" and is a key characteristic of good design. It explains that modularity involves decomposing a problem into
modules with limited interactions, which simplifies understanding and reduces complexity.

Measuring Modularity (Page 628): It discusses the difficulty in quantitatively measuring the modularity of a design but suggests that a
design can be considered highly modular if it exhibits high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules.

Advantages of Modular Design (Page 634): The text outlines the benefits of modular design, including reusability, understandability,
and reduced complexity, by ensuring that modules are functionally independent.

Layered Design and Modularity (Page 646): It mentions that a layered design, which is a form of modular design, achieves control
abstraction and simplifies understanding and debugging.

Assessment and Improvement of Modularity (Page 672): The book poses questions regarding the assessment of modularity in design,
factors affecting modularity, and ways to improve designs with low cohesion and high coupling.

Function-Oriented Design and Modularity (Page 675): It discusses how top-down decomposition in function-oriented design leads to a
modular structure that embodies good design characteristics.

Integration Testing and Modularity (Pages 1213, 1214, 1217): The book explains how integration testing strategies, such as the big-
bang, bottom-up, and mixed approaches, relate to the modular structure of software systems.

These sections collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its
importance, implementation, and benefits in the context of design and testing.

 

 

3. "Introduction to Software Engineering":

- Describes how the development of the Linux operating system benefits from modularity, with each source code module being
reviewed by many programmers.

- Discusses the importance of modular requirements for the flexibility of design and code development.

- Explains different approaches to software integration (big bang, bottom-up, and top-down) and their relation to modularity.

In the book "Introduction to Software Engineering," the modular approach is discussed in various contexts:
Open Source Development and Modularity (Page 207): The book describes how the development of the Linux operating system
benefits from modularity, as each source code module is reviewed by many programmers, which enhances the quality and maintainability

of the code.

Requirements and Modularity (Page 331): It discusses how having modular requirements allows for the design and code to be
developed in a modular manner, which adds flexibility and makes it easier to incorporate new requirements with minimal changes.

Software Integration Approaches (Pages 851, 853, 854, 855, 857): The text explains different approaches to software integration (big
bang, bottom-up, and top-down) and how they relate to modularity. The big bang approach, for example, is more feasible if the system
design is sufficiently modular, allowing individual software components to adhere to appropriate interface and performance standards.

Advocacy for Higher Modularity (Page 866): The book advocates for a higher degree of modularity, especially in software that
combines procedural and object-oriented portions, to simplify integration and maintenance.

Hybrid Integration Approach (Page 909): It describes a hybrid approach to software integration that combines top-down and bottom-up
techniques, which relies on the modularity of the system to be effective.

References to Modularity Research (Page 1102): The book cites works by D.L. Parnas, a pioneer in software engineering, who has
written extensively on the modular structure of complex systems, highlighting the importance of modularity in software design.

These sections collectively underscore the importance of the modular approach in software engineering, particularly in terms of system
integration, flexibility in design, and the ability to handle changes effectively.

 

 

4. "Software Engineering, 10th Edition":

- Mentions the incremental approach to software development, which implies the need for a modular approach to maintain the system's
structure.

- Discusses Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and service-oriented approaches, highlighting the move towards more
modular systems.

- Emphasizes the importance of architectural design in successful reuse, focusing on the selection and integration of individual
components into the system architecture.

In "Software Engineering, 10th Edition," the modular approach is discussed indirectly through various software engineering practices and
principles:

Incremental Approach and Structural Degradation (Page 112): The book mentions the incremental approach to software development,
which can lead to structural degradation and code messiness as new increments are added. This implies the need for a modular
approach to maintain the system's structure and manageability.

Agile Methods and Plan-Driven Development (Page 164): While not directly mentioning modularity, the discussion contrasts agile
methods with plan-driven approaches, highlighting the challenges of applying heavyweight, plan-driven development to smaller systems.
This suggests the importance of adaptability and modularity in software development practices.

Components and Component Models (Page 1103): The book discusses Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and service-

oriented approaches, which replace traditional embedded components. This section highlights the move towards more modular, service-
oriented systems in software development.

Architectural Design and Reuse (Page 1130): It emphasizes the importance of architectural design in successful reuse, which involves
identifying and validating components for reuse. This process is inherently modular, focusing on the selection and integration of individual
components into the system architecture.

Systems of Systems (SoS) and Architectural Frameworks (Page 1442): The text discusses the architectural design of systems of
systems (SoS) and the use of architectural frameworks. These frameworks support the development of complex systems by promoting a
modular approach, where the system is viewed as a collection of interconnected components.

While the term "modular approach" is not explicitly used, the principles of modularity underpin many of the discussed concepts, such as
incremental development, component-based engineering, and the architectural design of complex systems.

 

 

5. "Software Engineering: Modern Approaches":
- Highlights that software should be modular, facilitating easier planning, development, modification, documentation, and testing.
- Lists modularity as one of the principal goals of software design, involving dividing the software into well-defined parts.
- Discusses the importance of decomposing software into modules that maximize cohesion and minimize coupling.
- Advocates for incremental integration over big bang integration, emphasizing the modular assembly of software systems.

In "Software Engineering: Modern Approaches," the modular approach is discussed in several contexts:

Design Simplification and Modularity (Page 842): The book emphasizes that software should be modular, allowing parts to be replaced
without affecting others, facilitating easier planning, development, modification, documentation, and testing. It also highlights that
modularity enables assigning different people to work on different parts of the software.

Principles of Software Design (Pages 842-843): Modularity is listed as one of the principal goals of software design, alongside
sufficiency, understandability, cohesion, coupling, robustness, flexibility, reusability, information hiding, efficiency, and reliability. The book

explains that modularity involves dividing the software into well-defined parts.

Software Decomposition (Page 844): The text discusses the importance of decomposing software into modules that maximize
cohesion within each module and minimize coupling between modules. This approach helps simplify complex tasks.

Good Design and Modularization (Page 1329): It states that good design requires modularization, which should ideally be performed in
advance but can also be beneficial when done after the fact. The book mentions the Facade design pattern as a means of handling
modularity on a larger scale.

Integration Strategies (Pages 1414-1416): The book contrasts big bang integration with incremental integration, advocating for the
latter as it allows for the system to be built step by step in small increments, making it easier to isolate integration problems.

Summary of Integration (Page 1439): It summarizes the integration process, emphasizing the advantages of incremental integration
over big bang integration and highlighting the use of the Facade design pattern to facilitate interface testing between modules.

These sections collectively provide a comprehensive view of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its importance in
design, development, and integration processes. The book underscores the benefits of modularity in terms of simplification,
understandability, and maintainability of software systems.

 

 

Overall, these ebooks collectively underscore the significance of the modular approach in software engineering, highlighting its benefits
in terms of design simplicity, maintainability, and flexibility. The modular approach is presented as a fundamental principle across different
aspects of software development, from architectural design to integration strategies.

application. Some of the larger services might use a component-based approach to break their code into
decoupled pieces. Other services might use a multitier approach to separate their features from the data
storage layer. (Combining different architectures can also sound impressive at cocktail parties. “Yes, we
decided to go with an event-driven multitier approach using rule-based distributed components.”)

CLASSYDRAW ARCHITECTURE

 

Suppose you want to pick an architecture for the ClassyDraw application described
in Chapter 4. (Recall that this is a drawing program somewhat similar to MS Paint
except it lets you select and manipulate drawing objects.) One way to do that is to
think about each of the standard architectures and decide whether it would make
sense to use while building the program.

1. Monolithic—This is basically the default if none of the more elaborate archi-
tectures apply. We'll come back to this one later.

2.  Client/server, multitier—ClassyDraw stores drawings in files, not a database,
so client/server and multitier architectures aren’t needed. (You could store
drawings in a database if you wanted to, perhaps for an architectural frm
or some other use where there would be some benefit. For a simple drawing
application, it would be overkill.)

3. Component-based—Y ou could think of different pieces of the application as
components providing services to each other. For example, you could think of
a “rectangle component” that draws a rectangle. For this simple application,
it’s probably just as easy to think of a Rectangle class that draws a rectangle,
so I’m not going to think of this as a component-based approach.

4. — Service-oriented—This is even less applicable than the component-based approach.
PP P PP
Spreading the application across multiple computers connected via web services
(or some other kind of service) wouldn't help a simple drawing application.

5. Data-centric—The user defines the drawings, so there’s no data around which
to organize the program. (Although a more specialized program, perhaps a
drafting program for an architectural firm or an aerospace design program,
might interact with data in a meaningful way.)

6.  Event-driven—The user interface will be event-driven. For example, the user
selects a tool and then clicks and drags to create a new shape.

7. Rule-based—There are no rules that the user must follow to make a drawing,
so this program isn’t rule-based.

8. Distributed—This program doesn’t perform extensive calculations, so distrib-
uting pieces across multiple CPUs or cores probably wouldn't help.

Because none of the more exotic architectures applied (such as multitier or service-

oriented), this application can have a simple monolithic architecture with an event-
driven user interface.

V-model | 275

 

Figure 12-4 and Figure 12-5 show projects that use three increments, but you can use as many
as you like. In fact, for an application with a long useful life, you could use an open-ended series
of increments. You would just keep adding new increments whenever you wanted to make a new
version of the application to add new features.

REFACTORING REQUIRED

 

Sometimes, programs that grow incrementally become strange creatures with
illogical interfaces, inconsistent mechanisms, and code as strange as anything
H.P. Lovecraft could have written (if he’d been a programmer). I’ve worked
with programs that had been used and modified for decades, and it was nearly
impossible to make any significant changes without breaking something.

At some point, you may need to slip in a refactoring increment to clean house. That
increment might add little or no new functionality, but it will let you move forward
with future increments more efficiently.

The incremental waterfall model is actually somewhat adaptive because it lets you reevaluate your
direction at the start of each increment, but I’ve included it in this chapter for three reasons. First,
this is a waterfall variation, so | want to put it with the other waterfall models.

Second, it’s not all that adaptive. You can change direction when you start a new increment, but
within each increment the model runs predictively. You can make only small changes allowed
by whichever particular waterfall model you use for the increments (waterfall with feedback or
sashimi).

The fact that you’re building on a previous increment also gives the project some inertia that limits
the amount of change you can add to the next release. For example, you can add, remove, and
tweak features in a new increment, but you probably shouldn’t radically change the user interface.
That would be more like a completely new project rather than an incremental change to the ongoing
series.

Finally, increments tend to run over a longer scale than the stages in most adaptive models. For
example, a long-running project might use a new increment every year or two. That gives the users
a nice, steady, predictable release schedule. In contrast, some adaptive models produce new builds
of an application every month or even every week. You probably wouldn’t release all of those builds
to the users, but the pace is definitely more frenetic. The incremental waterfall model is somewhat
adaptive, but usually over long timescales.

V-MODEL

V-model is basically a waterfall that’s been bent into a V shape, as shown in Figure 12-6.

The tasks on the left side of the V break the application down from its highest conceptual level into

more and more detailed tasks. This process of breaking the application down into pieces that you
can implement is called decomposition.

1 In this text, we shall use the terms module and module structure to loosely mean the folowing—A module is a

collection of procedures and data structures. The data structures mn a module are accessible only to the procedures
defined inside the module. A module forms an independently compilable unit and may be linked to other modules to
form a complete application. The term module structure will be used to denote the way in which different modules
invoke each other’s procedures.

characteristics to be easily understandable:

e It should assign consistent and meaningful names to various design
components.

e It should make use of the principles of decomposition and abstraction
in good measures to simplify the design.

We had discussed the essential concepts behind the principles of
abstraction and decomposition principles in Chapter 1. But, how can the
abstraction and decomposition principles are used in arriving at a design
solution? These two principles are exploited by design methodologies to
make a design modular and layered. (Though there are also a few other
forms in which the abstraction and decomposition principles can be used in
the design solution, we discuss those later). We can now define the
characteristics of an easily understandable design as follows: A design
solution is understandable, if it is modular and the modules are arranged in
distinct layers.

 

A design solution should be modular and layered to be understandable.
We now elaborate the concepts of modularity and layering of modules:

 

Modularity

A modular design is an effective decomposition of a problem. It is a basic
characteristic of any good design solution. A modular design, in simple
words, implies that the problem has been decomposed into a set of
modules that have only limited interactions with each other.
Decomposition of a problem into modules facilitates taking advantage
of the divide and conquer principle. If different modules have either no
interactions or little interactions with each other, then each module can
be understood separately. This reduces the perceived complexity of the
design solution greatly. To understand why this is so, remember that it
may be very difficult to break a bunch of sticks which have been tied
together, but very easy to break the sticks individually.

It is not difficult to argue that modularity is an important characteristic of a
good design solution. But, even with this, how can we compare the
modularity of two alternate design solutions? From an inspection of the
module structure, it is at least possible to intuitively form an idea as to which
design is more modular For example, consider two alternate design solutions

to a problem that are represented in Figure 5.2, in which the modules M1 ,
M2 etc. have been drawn as rectangles. The invocation of a module by
another module has been shown as an arrow. It can easily be seen that the
design solution of Figure 5.2(a) would be easier to understand since the
interactions among the different modules is low. But, can we quantitatively
measure the modularity of a design solution? Unless we are able to
quantitatively measure the modularity of a design solution, it will be hard to
say which design solution is more modular than another. Unfortunately, there
are no quantitative metrics available yet to directly measure the modularity
of a design. However, we can quantitatively characterise the modularity of a
design solution based on the cohesion and coupling existing in the design.

 

A design solution is said to be highly modular, if the different modules in the solution
have high cohesion and their inter-module couplings are low.

 

A software design with high cohesion and low coupling among modules is
the effective problem decomposition we discussed in Chapter 1. Such a
design would lead to increased productivity during program development by
bringing down the perceived problem complexity.

Figure 5.2: Two design solutions to the same problem.

Based on this classification, we would be able to easily judge the cohesion
and coupling existing in a design solution. From a knowledge of the cohesion
and coupling in a design, we can form our own opinion about the modularity
of the design solution. We shall define the concepts of cohesion and coupling
and the various classes of cohesion and coupling in Section 5.3. Let us now
discuss the other important characteristic of a good design solution—layered

825

of shared data, the modules are tightly coupled.

e If the interactions occur through some shared data, then also we say
that they are highly coupled.

If two modules either do not interact with each other at all or at best
interact by passing no data or only a few primitive data items, they are said
to have low coupling.

Cohesion: To understand cohesion, let us first understand an analogy.
Suppose you listened to a talk by some speaker. You would call the speech to
be cohesive, if all the sentences of the speech played some role in giving the
talk a single and focused theme. Now, we can extend this to a module in a
design solution. When the functions of the module co-operate with each other
for performing a single objective, then the module has good cohesion. If the
functions of the module do very different things and do not co-operate with
each other to perform a single piece of work, then the module has very poor
cohesion.

Functional independence

By the term functional independence, we mean that a module performs a
single task and needs very little interaction with other modules.

 

A module that is highly cohesive and also has low coupling with other modules is said
to be functionally independent of the other modules.

Functional independence is a key to any good design primarily due to the
following advantages it offers:

Error isolation: Whenever an error exists in a module, functional
independence reduces the chances of the error propagating to the other
modules. The reason behind this is that if a module is functionally
independent, its interaction with other modules is low. Therefore, an error
existing in the module is very unlikely to affect the functioning of other
modules.

Further, once a failure is detected, error isolation makes it very easy to
locate the error On the other hand, when a module is not functionally
independent, once a failure is detected in a functionality provided by the
module, the error can be potentially in any of the large number of modules
and propagated to the functioning of the module.

Scope of reuse: Reuse of a module for the development of other
applications becomes easier. The reasons for this is as follows. A functionally

tested in another module.

Common coupling: Two modules are common coupled, if they share some
global data items.

Content coupling: Content coupling exists between two modules, if they
share code. That is, a jump from one module into the code of another module
can occur Modern high-level programming languages such as C do not
support such jumps across modules.

The different types of coupling are shown schematically in Figure 5.5. The
degree of coupling increases from data coupling to content coupling. High
coupling among modules not only makes a design solution difficult to
understand and maintain, but it also increases development effort and also
makes it very difficult to get these modules developed independently by
different team members.

5.4 LAYERED ARRANGEMENT OF MODULES

Thecontrol hierarchyrepresents the organisation of program
components in terms of their call relationships. Thus we can say that
the control hierarchy of a design is determined by the order in which
different modules call each other. Many different types of notations
have been used to represent the control hierarchy. The most common
notation is a tree-like diagram known as a structure chart which we
shall study in some detail in Chapter 6. However, other notations such
as Warnier-Orr [1977, 1981] or Jackson diagrams [1975] may also be
used. Since, Warnier-Orr and Jackson’s notations are not widely used
nowadays, we shall discuss only structure charts in this text.

In a layered design solution, the modules are arranged into several layers
based on their call relationships. A module is allowed to call only the modules
that are at a lower layer. That is, a module should not call a module that is
either at a higher layer or even in the same layer. Figure 5.6(a) shows a
layered design, whereas Figure 5.6(b) shows a design that is not layered.
Observe that the design solution shown in Figure 5.6(b), is actually not
layered since all the modules can be considered to be in the same layer. In
the following, we state the significance of a layered design and subsequently
we explain it.

function that the system needs to perform is analysed and hierarchically
decomposed into more detailed functions. On the other hand, during
structured design, all functions identified during structured analysis are
mapped to a module structure. This module structure is also called the high-
level design or the software architecture for the given problem. This is
represented using a structure chart.

The high-level design stage is normally followed by a detailed design stage.
During the detailed design stage, the algorithms and data structures for the
individual modules are designed. The detailed design can directly be
implemented as a working system using a conventional programming
language.

 

It is important to understand that the purpose of structured analysis is to capture the
detailed structure of the system as perceived by the user, whereas the purpose of
structured design is to define the structure of the solution that is suitable for
implementation in some programming language.

 

The results of structured analysis can therefore, be easily understood by
the user. In fact, the different functions and data in structured analysis are
named using the user's terminology. The user can therefore even review the
results of the structured analysis to ensure that it captures all his
requirements.

In the following section, we first discuss how to carry out structured
analysis to construct the DFD model. Subsequently, we discuss how the DFD
model can be transformed into structured design.

6.2 STRUCTURED ANALYSIS

We have already mentioned that during structured analysis, the major

processing tasks (high-level functions) of the system are analysed, and
thedata flow among these processing tasks are represented
graphically. Significant contributions to the development of the
structured analysis techniques have been made by Gane and Sarson
[1979], and DeMarco and Yourdon [1978]. The structured analysis
technique is based on the following underlying principles:

e Top-down decomposition approach.

e Application of divide and conquer principle. Through this each high-
level function is independently decomposed into detailed functions.

e Graphical representation ofthe analysis results usingdata flow

needed to be designed to detect these. We examine these issues as
well as some other basic issues in testing object-oriented programs in
the following subsections.

10.11.1 What is a Suitable Unit for Testing

Object-oriented Programs?

For procedural programs, we had seen that procedures are the basic units of
testing. That is, first all the procedures are unit tested. Then various tested
procedures are integrated together and tested. Thus, as far as procedural
programs are concerned, procedures are the basic units of testing. Since
methods in an object-oriented program are analogous to procedures in a
procedural program, can we then consider the methods of object-oriented
programs as the basic unit of testing? Weyuker studied this issue and
postulated his anticomposition axiom as follows:

 

Adequate testing of individual methods does not ensure that a dass has been
satisfactorily tested.

The main intuitive justification for the anticomposition axiom is the
following. A method operates in the scope of the data and other methods of
its object. That is, all the methods share the data of the class. Therefore, it is
necessary to test a method in the context of these. Moreover, objects can
have significant number of states. The behaviour of a method can be different
based on the state of the corresponding object. Therefore, it is not enough to
test all the methods and check whether they can be integrated satisfactorily.
A method has to be tested with all the other methods and data of the
corresponding object. Moreover, a method needs to be tested at all the
states that the object can assume. As a result, it is improper to consider a
method as the basic unit of testing an object-oriented program.

 

 

An object is the basic unit of testing of object-oriented programs. |

 

Thus, in an object oriented program, unit testing would mean testing each
object in isolation. During integration testing (called cluster testing in the
object-oriented testing literature) various unit tested objects are integrated
and tested. Finally, system-level testing is carried out.

any special system constraints, such as the system having a real-time response to certain
inputs; unusual features of the project, such as being the first time that a new technology,
programming language, or software development environment is used; any interoperable
software systems that may impact the cost of the software; and, of course, the cost of the
software itself. In many organizations, the baseline information may be broken down into
the cost of different subsystems.

The determination of “similarity” or “sameness” is made by examining the character-
istics of projects in the baseline database and selecting the projects for which information
is deemed to be relevant. The effective determination of “similarity” is largely a matter of
experience.

Ideally, the cost estimation will be developed in the form of a cost for the system (and
each subsystem for which cost estimates are to be made) and an expected range in which
the costs are likely to be for the system whose cost is being estimated.

1.8.5 Reviews ancl Inspections

Different organizations have developed different approaches to ensure that software proj-
ects produce useful, correct software. Some techniques appear to work better in certain
development environments than others and, thus, there is difficulty in simply adapting one
successful approach to a totally different environment.

However, there is one thing that has been shown to be highly successful in every organi-
zation in which it is carried out properly: the design review. Reviews should be held at each
major milestone of a project, including requirements, design, source code, and test plans.
For a software life cycle that uses an iterative process, a review should be held at each itera-
tion of the creation of major items within the software life cycle.

‘The basic idea is simple: each artifact produced for a specific milestone during develop-
ment must be subjected to a formal review in which all relevant documents are provided;
a carefully designed set of questions must be answered; and the results of the review must
be written down and disseminated to all concerned parties.

The following will describe several kinds of reviews for requirements, design, source
code, and test plans. In the sense in which they are used here, the two terms review and
inspection are synonymous. In the general literature, the term inspection may be used in
this sense or may instead refer to a procedure for reading the relevant documents.

There is one other point that should be made about reviews and inspections. This book
emphasizes systematic methods that attempt to determine problems in requirements and
design well before the software is reduced to code. This emphasis is consistent with experi-
ences across a Wide variety of software projects in nearly every application area.

‘The open source approach of the development of the Linux operating system avoids
reviews of requirements and designs, and instead relies on the efforts of a large number
of programmers who review source code posted on line. Thus each source code module
is intensively reviewed, often by hundreds of programmers. Modifications to the source

code are controlled by a much smaller team of experts. Of course, there is also configura-
tion management and testing, just in different order. Consult the article by McConnell
(McConnell, 1999) for an overview of the open source approach.

this stage of their academic careers, and hence such familiarity will not be assumed in the
discussion in this book.

Two topics are often missing from the typical education of computer science students
(prior to taking a course emphasizing software engineering principles): detailed, practical
instruction in (1) requirements and (2) design.

Unfortunately, most of the other software engineering activities are irrelevant if the
requirements are wrong, incomplete, or vague. One way in which the term “wrong” here
is used is the sense of being inconsistent; one requirement contradicts another. Let us con-
sider what can happen in each of these three cases.

If the requirements for a project are wrong, then the rest of the software engineering
activities will have to be redone, assuming that someone recognizes the error or errors in the
requirements. This is extremely expensive, and often means that much of the subsequent work
is wrong and has to be discarded. In the worst case, all the project effort must be scrapped.

What else can “wrong” mean? It may mean that the requirements do not fit the desired
system’s initial use. This is called “building the system wrong.” “Wrong” might also mean
that the requirements are for a system that is obsolete or completely the opposite of what
most customers want. This is called “building the wrong system.”

‘There are two possibilities if the requirements are incomplete. The best-case scenario
when the requirements are incomplete is that the requirements are so modular that the
project’s design and code also can be developed in a modular manner. In this case, it is
possible that the missing requirement can be fulfilled by additions both to the design and
the source code implementation with relatively few changes needed to incorporate the new
requirements. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of iterative approaches such as
the rapid prototyping or spiral development life cycle models. ‘The flexibility is even greater
in projects using agile methods.

If the requirements were complete but not modular, then it is unlikely that the design
and the resulting source code will be modular. In this case, major portions of the design
and source code will have to be scrapped because they are difficult to create given the lack
of consistency with modern programming techniques and the software engineering goal
of modularity. The experience of many failed software projects strongly indicates that the
lack of modular requirements is very expensive.

The third category of poor requirements occurs when the requirements are vague. In
this situation, it is difficult to know if the design is correct, because the software designers
do not know precisely what requirements mean. The designers may make some unwar-
ranted assumptions about the intentions of the requirements engineer. These assumptions,
if not correct, can be the major source of disaster for projects. The most common problem
is that the unwarranted assumptions become part of the culture of the project and there-
fore are never questioned.

‘There is one more thing to keep in mind about vague requirements. If the requirements
are vague as stated, but the software engineers working on the project are highly knowl-
edgeable in a particular application domain and have the unquestioned capability to fill in
the gaps and complete them in a clear, unambiguous manner, an agile software develop-
ment process may work, provided there is support from senior management.

FIGURE 6.4 Illustration of the first step in the bottom-up approach to software integration: deter-
mination of bottom-level modules and linking each of them to an artificial driver module.

6.9 SOFTWARE INTEGRATION

Suppose that we have tested each of the software modules individually for a program writ-
ten in a procedural language such as C or Ada. Alternatively, suppose that we have tested
each of the classes that are to be used in an object-oriented program written in C++, Java,
Swift, or similar. The same issue occurs if the program contains multiple classes. We have
to have some assurance that the entire program works correctly as a unit.

In addition, we have to make sure that our program functions correctly as a system.
‘That is, we have to make certain that our program works properly with any software pack-
age that we intend to use with our program. Recall that this property, which is known as
interoperability, was one of the goals of software engineering discussed in Chapter 1.

‘The process of ensuring that programs that are created from individual program mod-
ules that work together as a unit is called software integration.

Of course, many software systems, including the one we are developing as part of our
major software engineering example, consist of both object-oriented and procedural por-
tions. Hence, it may be necessary to employ both procedurally and object-based software
integration techniques. The beginning software engineer may be surprised at the formality FIGURE 6.5 Illustration of the second step in the bottom-up approach to software integration:
in which many organizations approach the issue of software integration. Software integra- integration of modules that are just above the bottom level with artificial driver modules.

tion is much more than simply getting the individual modules to compile and link together

into a complete system. The final software system must meet the requirements that were set

for it initially. This testing of the final software is called system testing to distinguish it from

the topic of unit testing, which is what was discussed in Sections 6.1 through 6.8.
Software integration is not always a smooth process, particularly in modern develop-
FIGURE 6.6 Illustration of the third step in the bottom-up approach to software integration: inte-

ment environments in which efficiency requires reuse of existing software modules or even
gration of the next level of modules with artificial driver modules.

existing COTS packages. A major problem can occur if one or more modules are extremely
difficult to integrate with others. If the project’s management has determined that the rea-
son is the lack of adherence to standards or the low quality of the module in the sense of a
large number of software defects, then the original coding team, design team, or require-
ments team may be called on to help with the problem.

‘There are three common approaches to software integration:

 
 
  

+ Big bang
+ Bottom-up

+ Top-down

Each of these approaches has considerable advantages and disadvantages and, therefore,
each has its proponents and detractors. We describe each of these approaches in turn.

The big bang approach to software integration is so named because it attempts to inte-
grate the previously tested software modules and existing COTS products into a complete
system without any preliminary software integration activities. The basic idea is to see if the
system works as an entirety without any changes to individual modules or configuration.

   

Ideally, the newly created system will work perfectly. The big bang approach is illustrated FIGURE 6.7 Illustration of the final step in the bottom-up approach to software integration: inte-
in Figure 6.3. In the figure the boxes represent individual software modules, subsystems, gration of the top-level module into the system with all artificial driver modules replaced by actual
modules.

‘The bottom-up approach is best suited to reuse of software components that are fairly
fine grained in the sense that they have a clearly defined, but narrowly limited, function-
ality. The likelihood of having a large number of such functions to characterize, catalog,
maintain, and access is small if there is not a large reuse library of such components.

‘The top-down approach is best suited to a situation in which there are a few, higher-level
components. This can avoid the overhead of maintenance of a reuse library. Reusing large,
high-level components has the potential to reduce system costs. However, finding an exact
match of an existing high-level software component to an actual set of requirements is
relatively rare.

We now turn to a discussion of integration issues for object-oriented programs. It is
clear that complete testing of all possible interactions of objects is essentially impossible.

‘The source code we used for some simple arithmetic with complex numbers that was
given in Example 6.5 illustrates this effective impossibility. Consider the possibilities: each
complex, real, double, or integer operand must be paired with a second operand of the
same set of types. This is a minimum of sixteen possible cases, each of which must be tested
to have even one example of each type tested. There are sixty-four cases if we allow multiple
types of the results of the arithmetic operations, with one test case for each pair of possible
argument types and four basic arithmetic operations. This is entirely too much.

Of course, integration issues are even more complex for software that has both pro-
cedural and object-oriented portions. We advocate striving for even a higher degree of
modularity than norma] in this situation. Considering the portions separately as much as
possible seems to be the best approach, but there is little research to guide the practitioner.

In some circumstances, another integration technique, known as plug and play, may
be used. It is easiest to explain the technique by an example. Some software systems, such
as those used for aircraft control, can never be taken off-line. For such systems, new mod-
ules that add functionality or modules that are replacements for faulty ones must be inte-
grated during regular operation. This requires a very careful integration process that we

testing the “glueware” used to combine these utilities. It is clear that black-box testing is a
natural choice for most of our system.

What about white-box testing? This method appears to be especially appropriate when
there are many execution paths and complex internal logic. This seems to characterize the
software intended to provide an interface to the operating system for the linking of the
names of input files to later routines in the program. Recall that this was to be done by
means of command-line arguments. The requirement to allow wild cards in the input file
names and to treat multilevel directories properly suggests a complexity that makes check-
ing each path especially important.

Of course some object-oriented methods must be applied to the back end of the system.
It seems as if the main questions to be answered about this subsystem’s correctness are the
completeness of the member functions of the appropriate classes and the proper assign-
ment of default values to member functions.

‘This section will close with the following two changes to the requirements for the major
project. You willbe asked to modify the testing and integration processes in order to reflect
the new requirements in the exercises. ‘The first change is that the customer now wants a
web-based user interface instead of one that is PC based. What changes need to be made to
the testing and integration processes? The second change is that the customer now wants to
use a cloud for data storage instead of one that is PC based. What changes need to be made
to the testing and integration process?

6.18 INTEGRATING THE MAJOR SOFTWARE PROJECT

We will now apply the techniques of software integration to the large running software
example that we have been considering throughout this book. The assumption is that all
the modules have been tested individually and that all have passed their tests.

In order to avoid writing a large number of artificial drivers or stubs, we will follow
an integration approach that is a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up techniques. We will
start with a top-down approach. ‘The interface will be checked to see if the file names are
properly handled. Each input source code file will be checked to see if the first subsystem
recognizes the files and the appropriate directories. This is little removed from the testing
techniques that we would apply to this subsystem if we tested it by itself.

Once we have tested the initial subsystem properly and linked to the operating system
by means of command-line arguments, we will then begin linking the analysis subsystem
modules in groups. Naturally, we will consider each of the analysis tools as a single entity
for the purpose of software integration.

‘There is one point to be discussed before we begin. MS/DOS has a facility to connect the
output of one executable file to the input of another using pipes, in much the same way that
UNIX allows the pipe method of interprocess communication. Commands such as

 

type file.txt |more

allow multiple actions to take place with simple commands. It is conceivable that we could
link file analysis tools by using a command such as

Problems with incremental development

Although incremental development has many advantages, itis not problem free. The primary cause of the
difficulty is the fact that large organizations have bureaucratic procedures that have evolved over time and
there may be a mismatch between these procedures and a more informal iterative or agile process.

Sometimes these procedures are there for good reasons. For example, there may be procedures to ensure
that the software meets properly implements extemal regulations (e.g., in the United States, the Sarbanes
Oxley accounting regulations). Changing these procedures may not be possible, so process conflicts may
be unavoidable.

much has been implemented. Customers find it difficult to judge progress from
software design documents.

3. Early delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible,
even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to use
and gain value from the software earlier than is possible with a waterfall process.

From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:

1. The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure pro-
eress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost effective to produce docu-
ments that reflect every version of the system.

2. System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Regular change
leads to messy code as new functionality is added in whatever way is possible.
It becomes increasingly difficult and costly to add new features to a system. To
reduce structural degradation and general code messiness, agile methods sug-
gest that you should regularly refactor (improve and restructure) the software.

The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large,
complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the
system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture, and the responsi-
bilities of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly
defined with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather
than developed incrementally.

Incremental development does not mean that you have to deliver each increment
to the system customer. You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to
customers and other stakeholders for comment, without necessarily delivering it
and deploying it in the customer's environment. Incremental delivery (covered in
Section 2.3.2) means that the software is used in real, operational processes, so user
feedback is likely to be realistic. However, providing feedback is not always possi-
ble as experimenting with new software can disrupt normal business processes.

activities apart from programming and testing. Itis perfectly feasible, in a plan-driven
process, to allocate requirements and plan the design and development phase as a
series of increments. An agile process is not inevitably code-focused, and it may
produce some design documentation. Agile developers may decide that an iteration
should not produce new code but rather should produce system models and documentation.

Agile methods

In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a widespread view that the best way to
achieve better software was through careful project planning, formalized quality
assurance, use of analysis and design methods supported by software tools, and con-
trolled and rigorous software development processes. This view came from the soft-
ware engineering community that was responsible for developing large, long-lived
software systems such as aerospace and government systems.

This plan-driven approach was developed for software developed by large teams,
working for different companies. Teams were often geographically dispersed and
worked on the software for long periods of time. An example of this type of software
is the control systems for a modern aircraft, which might take up to 10 years from
initial specification to deployment. Plan-driven approaches involve a significant
overhead in planning, designing, and documenting the system. This overhead is jus-
tified when the work of multiple development teams has to be coordinated, when the
system is a critical system, and when many different people will be involved in
maintaining the software over its lifetime.

However, when this heavyweight, plan-driven development approach is applied
to small and medium-sized business systems, the overhead involved is so large that
it dominates the software development process. More time is spent on how the sys-
tem should be developed than on program development and testing. As the system
requirements change, rework is essential and, in principle at least, the specification
and design have to change with the program.

Dissatisfaction with these heavyweight approaches to software engineering
led to the development of agile methods in the late 1990s. These methods allowed
the development team to focus on the software itself rather than on its design and
documentation. They are best suited to application development where the sys-
tem requirements usually change rapidly during the development process. They
are intended to deliver working software quickly to customers, who can then pro-
pose new and changed requirements to be included in later iterations of the sys-
tem. They aim to cut down on process bureaucracy by avoiding work that has
dubious long-term value and eliminating documentation that will probably never
be used.

The philosophy behind agile methods is reflected in the agile manifesto (http://
agilemanifesto.org) issued by the leading developers of these methods. This mani-
festo states:

to be unsuitable or may not work properly with other chosen components. You
may have to find alternatives to these components. Further requirements changes
may therefore be necessary, depending on the functionality of these components.

4. Development is a composition process where the discovered components are
integrated. This involves integrating the components with the component model
infrastructure and, often, developing adaptors that reconcile the interfaces of
incompatible components. Of course, additional functionality may also be
required over and above that provided by reused components.

The architectural design stage is particularly important. Jacobsen et al. (Jacobsen,
Gniss, and Jonsson 1997) found that defining a robust architecture is critical for suc-
cessful reuse. During the architectural design activity, you may choose a component
model and implementation platform. However, many companies have a standard
development platform (e.g.,.NET), so the component model is predetermined. As |
discussed in Chapter 6, you also establish the high-level architecture of the system at
this stage and make decisions about system distribution and control.

An activity that is unique to the CBSE process is identifying candidate compo-
nents or services for reuse. This involves a number of subactivities, as shown in
Figure 16.8. Initially, your focus should be on search and selection. You need to
convince yourself that components are available to meet your requirements.
Obviously, you should do some initial checking that the component is suitable, but
detailed testing may not be required. In the later stage, after the system architecture
has been designed, you should spend more time on component validation. You need
to be confident that the identified components are really suited to your application; if
not, then you have to repeat the search and selection processes.

The first step in identifying components is to look for components that are available
within your company or from trusted suppliers. There are few component vendors, so
you are most likely to be looking for components that have been developed in your own
organization or in the repositories of open-source software that are available. Software
development companies can build their own database of reusable components without
the risks inherent in using components from extemal suppliers. Alternatively, you may
decide to search code libraries available on the web, such as Sourceforge, GitHub, or
Google Code, to see if source code for the component that you need is available.

Once the component search process has identified possible components, you have to
select candidate components for assessment. In some cases, this will be a straightforward
task. Components on the list will directly implement the user requirements, and there will
not be competing components that match these requirements. In other cases, however,
the selection process is more complex. There will not be a clear mapping of requirements
onto components. You may find that several components have to be integrated to meet a

important that these interfaces are not too restrictive so that the system elements
can evolve and continue to be useful participants in the SoS.

4. Provide collaboration incentives. When the system elements are independently
owned and managed, it is important each system owner have incentives to continue
to participate in the system. These may be financial incentives (pay per use or reduced
Operational costs), access incentives (you share your data and I'll share mine), or
community incentives (participate in a SoS and you get a say in the community).

Sillitto (Sillitto 2010) has added to these principles and suggests additional
important design guidelines. These include the following:

1. Design a SoS as node and web architecture. Nodes are sociotechnical systems
that include data, software, hardware, infrastructure (technical components),
and organizational policies, people, processes, and training (sociotechnical).
The web is not just the communications infrastructure between nodes, but it also
provides a mechanism for informal and formal social communications between
the people managing and running the systems at each node.

2. Specify behavior as services exchanged between nodes. The development of
service-oriented architectures now provides a standard mechanism for system
operability. [fa system does not already provide a service interface, then this
interface should be implemented as part of the SoS development process.

3. Understand and manage system vulnerabilities. In any SoS, there will be unex-
pected failures and undesirable behavior. It is critically important to try to
understand vulnerabilities and design the system to be resilient to such failures.

The key message that emerges from both Maier’s and Sillitto’s work is that 50S
architects have to take a broad perspective. They need to look at the system as a
whole, taking into account both technical and sociotechnical considerations.
Sometimes the best solution to a problem is not more software but changes to the
rules and policies that govern the operation of the system.

Architectural frameworks such as MODAF (MOD 2008) and TOGAF (TOGAF
is a registered trademark of The Open Group 2011) have been suggested as a means
of supporting the architectural design of systems of systems. Architectural frame-
works were originally developed to support enterprise systems architectures, which
are portfolios of separate systems. Enterprise systems may be organizational systems
of systems, or they may have a simpler management structure so that the system
portfolio can be managed as a whole. Architectural frameworks are intended for the
development of organizational systems of systems where there is a single govern-
ance authority for the entire SoS.

An architectural framework recognizes that a single model of an architecture does
not present all of the information needed for architectural and business analysis.
Rather, frameworks propose a number of architectural views that should be created
and maintained to describe and document enterprise systems. Frameworks have
much in common and tend to reflect the language and history of the organizations

THE GOALS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN 351

only the code. The benefits of a fully detailed design are balanced against the time required to document and
maintain detailed designs. For large efforts, levels in between high level and detailed design may be identified.

This chapter introduces the concepts, needs, and terminology of software design. It sets the stage for
the remaining chapters in this part of the book, which include various concrete examples.

15.1 THE GOALS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN

The first goal of a software design is to be sufficient for satisfying the requirements. Usually, software designs must
also anticipate changes in the requirements, and so a second goal is flexibility. Another goal of software design is
robustness: the ability of the product to anticipate a broad variety of input. These and other goals are summarized in
Figure 15.2.

These goals sometimes oppose one another. For example, to make a design efficient it may be necessary
to combine modules in ways that limit flexibility. In fact, we trade off goals against each other in ways that
depend on the project's priorities.

A software design is sufficient if it provides the components for an implementation that satisties the
requirements. To assess such sufficiency, one needs to be able to understand it. This fact is obvious, but it has
profound consequences. It can be difficult to create an understandable design for applications due to the large
number of options that are typically available. OpenOffice, for example, is a very complex application when
viewed in complete detail. Yet OpenOffice is simple when viewed at a high level, as consisting of a few
subapplications: word processing, spreadsheet, presentations, and database.

Modularity is thus a key to understandability. Software is modular when it is divided into separately named
and addressable components. Modular software is much easier to understand than monolithic software, and
parts can be replaced without affecting other parts. It is easier to plan, develop, modify, document, and test.
When software is modular you can more easily assign different people to work on different parts.

A design isa form of communication. In its most elementary form, it documents the result of a designer's
thought process, and is used to communicate back to himself thereafter when he needs to know what he
designed. This is fine if the designer is to be the only person who has this need, but a project usually involves
several people throughout its lifetime. If a design is not understandable for them, it is of limited value, and the
project's health is at risk. Design simplification, in particular, frequently results in a better design.
Understandability is usually achieved by organizing the design as a progression from a high level with a
manageable number of parts, then increasing the detail on the parts.

A good software architect and designer forms a clear mental model of how the application will work at
an overall level, then develops a decomposition to match this mental model. She first asks the key modularity

 

* Sufficiency: handles the requirements

* Understandability: can be understood by intended audience

* Modularity: divided into well-defined parts

* Cohesion: organized so like-minded elements are grouped together

* Coupling: organized to minimize dependence between elements

* Robustness: can deal with wide variety of input

* Flexibility: can be readily modified to handle changes in requirements
* Reusability: can use parts of the design and implementation in other applications
* Information hiding: module internals are hidden from others

* Efficiency: executes within acceptable time and space limits

* Reliability: executes with acceptable failure rate

Figure 15.3 High cohesion and low coupling—bridge example

question such as: What five or six modules should we use to decompose a personal finance application? What
four or five modules neatly encompass a word processing application? After deciding this, she turns to
decomposing the components, and so on. This process is sometimes called “recursive design" because it
repeats the design process on design components at successively fine scales. Software decomposition itself
involves consideration of cohesion and coupling.

Cohesion within a module is the degree to which the module's elements belong together. In other
words, itis a measure of how focused a module is. The idea is not just to divide software into arbitrary parts
(ie., modularity), but to keep related issues in the same part. Coupling describes the degree to which modules
communicate with other modules. The higher the degree of coupling, the harder it is to understand and
change the system. To modularize effectively, we maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This principle helps to
decompose complex tasks into simpler ones.

Software engineering uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a principal means of explaining
design. Understand ing software design concepts by means of analogous physical artifacts is helpful to some,
and we will employ this means on occasion. Figure 15.3, for example, suggests coupling/cohesion goals by
showing an architecture for a bridge, in which each of the six components has a great deal of cohesion and
where the coupling between them is low. The parts of each bridge component belong together (e.g., the
concrete and the embedded metal reinforcing it this is high cohesion. On the other hand, each component
depends on just a few other components—two or three, in fact. This is low coupling.

The ‘Steel truss” in Figure 15.4, on the other hand, shows many components depending on each other at
one place. We would question this high degree of coupling.

616 CHAPTER24 REFACTORING

24.6 INTRODUCING MODULES

Good design requires modularization: a process of separating its essential elements. Whenever feasible, this
should be performed in advance. However, it is very useful to modularize after the fact as well—in other
words, to recognize useful modularization as the application grows and transitions into maintenance.

Classes by themselves are a means of modularization, but an application can contain hundreds of classes,
and so classes need organizing to enable designers to manage and apply them. A useful way to handle
modularity on this scale is via the Facade design pattern. Simplifying matters, the problem can be reduced to
thatshown in Figure 24.21, in which the design involves classes U, V, and W, where U references (mentions)
classes V and W. An example is U=Transaction, V=Customer, and W=Loan pool. Suppose that we want to
avoid multiple references like this (think of many classes instead of just the two in this simplification, and you
can imagine the resulting complexity). Class LJ must be modified because it should no longer reference both
classes V and W.

The refactoring in Figure 24.21 is simpleif U does not need to instantiate V objects or W objects. Thisis
the case when U needs only static methods of V or W. (Example: A transaction needs only a generic customer
functionality such as getting average assets of all customers; and the total amount in the loan pool.) In that
case, U references functionality in F only, and F does the work of translating such function calls into the static
calls on V or W.

The situation may be more involved, however. Suppose that U requires V instances in order to operate
(such as is usually the case when a transaction involves a customer). Ifwe want to protect V within a package,
then U has to depend on the facade interface F and no longer on V directly. Figure 24.22 shows how this can
be dealt with. First, Vis provided with an abstract interface VI (Step 1) that abstracts its public methods.
The Extract Interface refactoring can be used for this. Next, in Step 2, V is enclosed in a module (or package)

Figure 27.12 Module self-dependency—consider its effect on integration

handles the collection of data from patients, one that analyzes data for specific diseases, one that handles
emergency notifications such as calls to the police, and so on. It makes a great deal of sense to develop these
modules separately. For example, why not develop the diabetic analysis in an organization specializing in that
field, and have emergency notification developed by a company with experience in writing such software
reliably? Some modules may be effectively written by skilled teams working anywhere, geographically
speaking. Although continual integration, described below, is preferable in general, it may not be practical in
a case like this. Each high-level module and its subsidiaries may have to be developed separately, and then
integrated in big bang fashion.

The integration and testing of modules illustrates the wisdom of designing so that dependencies are
noncyclic. In other words, we try to avoid architectures in which a module depends on itself. Figure 27.12
illustrates such an architecture. We can't fully test any pair of modules alone. Our only choice is to use stubs or
to test all of them together, which multiplies the potential for hard-to-find and hard-to-fix defects.

27.3.2 Incremental Integration

Nowadays, software integration typically proceeds in an incremental manner in which software modules are
developed and assembled into progressively larger parts of the system. This is known as incremental integration
[1]. Gradually building the system means complexity increases incrementally, making it easier to isolate
integration problems. Incremental integration commences when the first two parts of an application are
developed, and continues until all its parts have been integrated into acomplete system, at which time system
testing commences. Stubs and drivers are employed during this process.

Throughout the integration process, software “builds” may be created that form the emerging system, as
illustrated in Figure 27.13. Before adding new modules, integration tests are executed against each build,
ensuring that the build works correctly. Figure 27.2 implies that modules are developed and integrated in
some order, but does not suggest how the order is determined. We usually determine the integration order by
basing it on the design of the system. Two common methods are bottom-up and top-down, and each must
account for dependencies between the modules making up the design.

27.3.3 Bottom-Up Integration

Suppose that an application consists of the modules and dependencies as shown in Figure 27.14.

In bottom-up integration, modules that are most depended on are developed and integrated first. Then
the modules that de pend on them are integrated next, and soon. In Figure 27.14, this implies thatModule 3 is
developed first, since it is at the “bottom" of the dependency tree. Modules 1 and 2 are integrated next with

the code that was checked in during the previous day. This makes the job of problem isolation and resolution
easier than if a longer time interval had elapsed between builds.

27.5 INTERFACE TESTING

Interface tests validate the interface of each module from the viewpoint of their usage by a client. These can be
conducted, to the extent possible, prior to the integration of a module (with necessary stubs), and then after
the integration of the module (with, typically, a reduced set of stubs). The Facade design pattern can be used
to facilitate interface testing. A facade object is created for each class or package, providing an implementa-
tion of its public interface. Each method in the facade checks its input parameters to ensure they are passed
correctly and returns a predetermined response. Thus, the caller can test its interface with a module without
knowledge of whether it is using the facade or the real implementation. This makes problem discovery and
isolation easier. Let's return to the video store as an example. Figure 27.24 shows the module decomposition
for this application.

each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the

Good morning Claire.

Unfortunately , i got news that my uncle passed away in the early hours of this day despite all the best
efforts of the hospital staffTo be frank, i knew deep inside that only a miracle could reverse the
inevitable because the odds were most upsetting from the beginning.

So i would like to please take today off in order to start dealing with all the consequences brought
forward by the event and i have just sent through the timetastic app a request for the day; | will also
need to go pick up at the airport some family members who will be leaving Paris this very morning.

And the private key whicn Is automatically password protected Is sent to tne user

So therefore from now on, our sftp users will not have to do anything really..
All they will have to care about is ... choosing a username....and the rest is done for them.
Best yet the process can be repeated for an unlimited number of users.

On the test performed on a server with one core and 2 GB of ram, the server was able to generate the
keys and set up all aspects of the server at the rate of 5 users per second.

| will push the updated code tomorrow

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday... was running

| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144.217.84.102

-username: arnold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

lam also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Good morning Claire.With the unavaibility of the arnoldclarkemployee site, | thought | would remind
you that | was meant to be have a day off today.
Claire Thomson 30/12/22 08:53

Yes that's fine take your day off there's very little you can do anyway

Did you manage to get any servers scanned yesterday? Didn't get a chance for catch up

30/12/22 09:44

Actually before my message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before running it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

Claire Thomson 30/12/22 09:45 Edited

yeah it'd be much easier to build a large manifest and do them all at the same time, would let us add

So here is my question:

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance
you would be interested into an investigation about an alternative which is about combining Nexus
(Artifact repository) and SonarQube (code vulnerability scanner that is applicable to Docker)

Of course both Sonarqube and Nexus are Open source but used by banks...the banks i was supported
not so long ago were using it.

re Thomson 20/12/22 15:29

No we've just renewed our contract with Palo Alto, we can use it for scanning on prem stuff too - there's

lots of bits we don't use
it scans our repository too

20/12/22 15:30

aaaah it is too late@®

Claire Thomson 20/12/22 15:30

it can do code scanning and stuff and is in the pipelines

ot approve there (or katie bell from admin as I've approved in timetastic she can do it in ACE) it'sa

pain having two systems, hopefully one day all the functionality will just be in ace

vs you'd had the 26th booked automatically on timetastic by admin as the company is closed

which one will be considered the system of truth ?

Good morning Claire.

| hope my message finds you well.

So, i was fortunate enough to review some of the awaiting tickets we have with Greg a couple of days
ago and i noticed a couple of them that are dealing with some security issues with a sftp server used

by one of our partners.

So i was wondering if i could may be take a few minutes of your time either today or tomorrow to
review these tickets together and see if i can begin dealing with them.

Of course i am fully aware that i haven't yet managed to deal with all the issues around knowing the
company environment but i think this very serious exercise could help me get to know the environment

even faster.

Also as i believe i should be able to bank a little bit on my recent role in cybersecurity to may be offer
some efficient solutions.

Please let me know what you think about this plan and many thanks in advance.

09/12/22 11:29
Hi Claire i would have a quick question.
So as we use Azure internally for our devops pipelines, i wanted to take a quick online course about
the ways of Azure. So | already bought a course on Udemy for this and wanted to know if you would be
ok with me going through this for about a week or so. | already went through the links you sent me and

can already see a lot of similarities with AWS and GCP but i thought such a course can only make things
even easier in the short to long term.

Of course, this course will not take any precedence whatsoever on any other important activities we
might have at any time of the day.

Thank you in advance

And one last question.

i noticed the icinga alerts by email. Are we the team supposed to write some scripts to
minimize/resolve some of these issues ? | would say yes since we are in the loop but i wanted to make
sure of this.

| noticed quite a few alerts around memory issues.Are we making use of packages such as zram for
memory optimization at all ? | am asking because i know from experience that with zram deployed,
memory utilization becomes way more efficient and we will see the very same servers doing the same
job with on average less memory used.

Thank you. The course was not at all expensive as is often the case on udemy

Claire Thomson 09/12/22 12:00

The alerts can be noisy, we're tried optimising the alerts previously but they're never quite right and
we've warnings set up too. We'll be moving alerts over to icinga2 and with the migration from Centos to
Ubuntu we're not overly concerned with the memory alerts at the moment - there's also lots of
resources available should we need to add any. We're not using zram. Those alerts do fluctuate quite a
bit by email

Most of the issues tend to be with the apps not being optimised, the alerts we care about most are the
ones we have set up for SMS - the critical ones that would require something to be done immediately

vs | know some companies these days do expect new hires to pick up anything meaningful in the first 3m
or so! That is perhaps overkill but taking it easy the first couple of weeks to do some reading setup etc
seems fine @
Hope you've not been too bored haha

No i was not bored at all as i interact a lot with the others (Jason, Greg and Zoe)....but really i could not
help it when i saw these 2 tickets..i thought to myself that this is at least an area where i could offer

Zoe has done most of the work with it - but give it's new features and your background I think it would
be something that's perfect for you to get involved with and see what extra usage we can get from it

This is a lot!

Claire Thomson 14/12/22 10:17

yes! so | agree a limit is a good thing, but 2200 -> 10 seems drastic

14/12/22 10:21

yes indeed 10 is a bit too low too...there already about 5 people in our team...and that would mean
that a message could not be forwarded to more than 4 extra persons...may be they could settle for
something around may be between 30 and 50.Honestly all these subjects are most definitively

interesting...i shall wait for tomorrow impatiently ! Thank you for taking time to explain all of this to me

You mentioned last week the fact that the company was in the process of sorting some licence for
vulnerability scanning on the containers e deploy on the cloud. So i wanted to know if by any chance

not so long ago were using it.

Actually befo y message, | had a call with Greg who was still in the process of reviewing the script
sent before rfirMing it.

So after our exchange, the most | could do was to ask to be given access to the servers to be scanned
from the jump servers(our ansible box).

Unfortunately Jason was busy and Greg too.

But most definitely | will see with them on Monday to be given access to the other servers and see how
| can help with the task of scanning them from the Jump servers

Claire Thomson 30/12/22 09:45 Edited

yeah it'd be much easier to build a large manifest and do them all at the same time, would let us add

keys to everything too
that's not a problem - enjoy your day off - sorry it's been such a chaotic start to your AC journey!

Hello Claire.

| have a quicl question
Edited
so regarding the sftp ticket...i am adding the possibility of having an SSL encrypted communication

between the server and the client

Now i wanted to know if it is ok , in regards to the company policy to have some self signed certificate
as they present the advantage of being as tough as we can envision them (4096 bits encryption)

6 Janu

Hi Claire.
| think we now have a robust vsftp server that could be deployed internally.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.

As soon as the internal environment is a bit more stable, i will deploy it on our internal VMware.
To test the ftp server, please use Filezilla with the following login credentials:

-Host ip: 144)/17.84.102

-username: @nold

-password: arnold

-port 21

-and accept to use the self signed certificate that will be presented to you.

there is security solution that gets the server to react as soon as low as 1 network packet of hostile
nature is received.

| am just now finishing to write a script to automate the deployment of this easily and another script
that will be used to set up user easily (as requested by one fo the backlog ticket)

| am also perfecting the automated configuration and deployment of snort (IDS) and OSSEC so that
these modules could eventually get deployed on a wider range of linux servers for security reasons.

Many thanks,

Marcel

So as you can see,Amazon does generate 2 keys, one private and one public.
The public key is kept on the server

And the private key is sent to us for authentication so we get to keep the private key.

| will push the updated code tomorrow

Ok | am now going to enjoy Sunday...and sorry for sending this message on a Sunday....| was running
the risk of forgetting tomorrow (the ailment of old age as | come to experience it) and | wanted to
devote tomorrow to a more agile and elastic way of dynamically generate terraform steps for AWS.

Many thanks

Claire Thomson 05/02 12:01

We need to allow multiple users access to the same accounts, and the same users/servers require
access to multiple accounts which is why them providing the public keys to us is useful, it just gets
added to the authorised_keys file.

| don't have any issue in reversing that and providing them the private key provided we can do the
same.

To be honest trying to get users to provide an SSH key at all is often difficult @

Thanks for the message, enjoy the rest of your weekend. Hope your Uncle is still stable x

POUR WORE PS PP ee GU.

So i would like to please take today off in order to start dealing with all the consequences brought
forward by the event and i have just sent through the timetastic app a request for the day; | will also
need to go pick up at the airport some family members who will be leaving Paris this very morning.
Please allow Ne to thank you for your support throughout this period of ups and downs.

Claire Thomson 07/02 08:22

I'm so sorry to hear that. Yes of course that's absolutely fine, my condolences to you all x

Claire Thomson 08/02 09:59

How are you? | thought you'd be off today - take any time you need

08/02 10:08

Good morning ClaireYes i am back.| decided to come back today.| think it is better. The pain will be

amazing opportunities i have in life and that includes all of my daily activities and of course duties.

Please find above a copy of the ansible for deploying sftp servers on premises
There are just 2 little things left really:

-Fixing the odd behaviours i see when execution reaches line 144 (Ansible generation of TLS
Certificate..w||rks perfectly with bash but is misbehaving completely with Ansible)

-and obviously making use of loops once the issue with the TLS Certificate (a rather trivial task once all
is operational)

However would you be ok with a creative one liner bash script added to the package ?
Something like below to eventually circumvent the issue with the TLS generation:
#!/bin/bash

#running TLS CErtificate generation

openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -out

/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem -days 3650

Hello Claire.

So it is just to let you know that i went through the repository as you advised yesterday and i think i
see what you mean.

Yes the ansible i tried to push yesterday is a massive 400 lines one...that does the job and even set up
new features but does need to be broken in smaller chunks/roles .

So this is my plan if you dont mind:
-Have a session with Jason as expressed yesterday.| am just waiting for his availability for today
-Agree with him on the steps to migrate the centos sftp to ubuntu so that we are all on the same page

-And apply the same principles as above to my aws terraform ; in this regard, i already spoke to Zoe
and i think a little code reorganization wont hurt anyone. | ll try to emulate what we have under /ac-

Gs Sorry I've had to move that meeting today - I've run out of time and Jason isn't feeling great

I've made it longer just to block out the time so we can move it around and just block anyone else from
trying to book mea meeting &

people keep overbooking me - it's a pain
look at my calendar, that's what it's there for - but noooo - "everyone else was free" - really annoys me

Thanks! Cyber basically get to control what is used/not used, so unfortunately we don't get much say in
it - only when they decide something we have to implement whatever idea they've come up with good
or bad haha

I'll happily pass on your offej/should they want to take you up on it - it would be good for them to have
someone with technical imptémentation knowledge of security tools
10/05 11:00
® yes i know we just got to execute the overall plan they design..i was mentioning this just in case

they were to some days ask for the opinion of our department some days.

But if you get a chance to get them to listen, please mention to them that the easiest way to disrupt

attacks at the earliest stage is to use the package "psad" in conjonction with iptables
to disrupt attacks at the ealiest stage

Claire Thomson 10/05 11:02

yeah we have a company called Barrier that deal with intrusion detection

that's how we found out about the incident, but we've (company) a large windows estate to think of

too ®

so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS" under "aws", there will be a folder "vpc terraform version 1.3.7"

with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version 1.3.7.

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:33

why? this should all be in on
It should be along these line:
AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
o> vpe-1.tf

-- vpe-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

older, it's all still in separate folders?
iscussed

it should be "= 1.3.7"

Claire Thomson 19/05 11:44

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right &

push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that just

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have an
idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them down,
each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them into a single
folder as requested by you last week:

The reason why i initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are considered
isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for scalability and
strict isolation from each other.

that was set up by Zoe and myself

for consistency with the simil;ar user on azure but also to enable certain commands so i dont think
from memmory that the user above was modified

ire Thomson 23/05 15:10

OK, so that key is associated that user? not you?

I'll try that then see if there is a difference, unless you've changed it already?

23/05 15:10

yes trhat user was create specifically for that task of running terraform commands from the cli
no i havent changed yet

23/05 15:28

® ah this is good news indeed.

Claire Thomson 23/05 15:28

yeah I'm guessing you'll have no outputs or variables, so you'll only need the main.tf and the file with
the VPC and all it's settings

it'll be much tider and easier to understand

once that's done and everything is imported and there's no changes in the plans, it will be easier to
make a module and pass in the values

yes this is why i am breaking it down for each of them and theen use the broken down files to bukld a
single configuration

Good morning Claire.| would need your help on a few little things please.

So | learnt last week that i inherited from my uncle total estate and the news came as
a shock since i did not want that and told him so many times.

But it seems to me my uncle had some surprises for me in store even when not around.

So i inherited from his flat in Paris and his mansion in Abidjan-Cocody .

So i inherited from his flat in Paris and his mansion in Abidjan-Cocody .

So i am forced by the situation to visit both France and the IVory Coast in the coming
future to deal with all the administrative duties that comes with that and wanted to know
f i could be authorised to work remotely from outside of the UK for a couple of weeks in

second half of June.

| can obviously ensure you that i will have access to a reliable internet connection in
both countries and a very safe environment to work in.

In Paris, i will be staying in the area called "La defense" and in the Ivory Coast,
| will be in Cocody precisely in my late uncle place which is below:

Claire Thomson 30/05 12:29

Can you also remember in addition to pushing changes to git - you also need to pull changes from
master into your branch to keep it up to date please

you will be OK as no one else is working in the area you are at moment - but if we don't do it elsewhere
we would get really bad merge conflicts to resolve.

30/05 13:07

@ Sorry Claire...believe me when i say that i was thinking about this this morning. OK i just wrote a
little script of 10 lines that will take care of that so that i cannot forget no matter what...i now

Hi Claire.

I think i did nterpret this comment from you the last time we had a chat about the terraform for
the vpc:

= Claire Thomson 19/05 11
So why? this should all be in one folder, it's all

It should be along these lines as discussed
AWS

in separate folders?

(contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)

vpe-1.tf
= vpe-2.tf
- variables.tf
— output.tf

it should be "= 1.3.7"

This si why i was going that route

but what is finally asked is pretty straightforward

and will ha dana hu tamarrauws i think i am aleasdw an it

i checked the result and it appears that the S3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical
iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since $3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR
iam watching your latest commit and noticed that part of the change:

SecretsFilter: 'ac1-sc-arch-ops-a-tasks-pat-token,new-relic-api-key'

23/02 14:15

replaced by

Good morning Zoe. | would have a quick question if you don't mind.So i heard during the meeting that
autoscaling was only now enabled in production.Was it specific to a product or is it the case across all
environments ? Also would you have by any chance something like a link to a place where the
applications we support/deal with are documented ?

Thank you in advance

Zoe MacKay 08/12/22 12:16

tm) Hi, we don't have it documented but it on our kubernetes clusters. You can find the config in the
terraform module we use here https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-tfmodule-aks-cluster and then
the specific cluster config https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform/tree/master/aks

Good morning Zoe...in all honesty, i am having a lot of problems to move safely towards the full
deployment on pp and might require a bit of your assistance for the deployment...and this is despite
having spent the whole evening plus an early start at 4 am today...i thought about jumping out the
window but then i thought it is kind of lame really...so for example i am still fighting with some
dependencies issues on kubectl for azure:

but then the github repository indicated does not have clear instructions for either windows or linux
So i am moving on the terraform part for now otherwise i wont have anything ready.

and it is the same for the admin credentials...

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR
iam watching your latest commit and noticed that part of the change:

So my understanding is that you are just inputting here a new key...am i correct ?

e MacKay 23/02

We had automation users before christmas SC.Arch-Ops-A-Tasks@aco.arnoldclark.com) but

cause AD was locked down we had to move it to a cloud only account. This account has been re-
enabled so just moving everything back to using it. So the PAT token is just a different name in the key
vault that is being used in these specific pipelines

Hello Zoe....

i checked the result and it appears that the $3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical

iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since S3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.

fallen over and needed standing up again, it's not a massive issue as we fail over to aws it's just
annoying.

On the whole the infrastructure is solid

Hi Greg.| would have a question please.So since you have been with Arnold clark, do you have an idea
of the most common incident we have to deal with in production environments ?

Also allow me to say that it is still time to get into a Choir or something alike. This singing talent cannot
be left to chance ...just saying

have you thought about contracting some established company in Poland for the work that will cost
you 110k ?

Of course doing this will be undermining British workers a bit but providing only you does it, no one
will get hurt overall

Yes who is charging you like a brit would do
but if you take a polish contractor from Poland, even with his flight toicket, you wont get there believe

Bonjour mon ami Marcel, comment ca va?

| want to pick your brain for your infosec knowledge

If you were to look at using a WAF with / in front of HAproxy, do you know off the top of your head what
open source software you'd use? This isn't for a piece of work, I'm just doing some research in the
background, so no rush

10/05 10:51

Bonjour cher ami Jason !

From experiencq\j know that financial institution (Societe GEnerale in France and many other UK
banks) make u modsecurity as a waf in front of haproxy for security purposes

Not only is modsecurity easy to set up in conjonction with haproxy but it does prove very efficient.

| just sent a message to a former colleague on mine still working for Ingenico in Paris (Ingenico the
french payment processor) and he confimed that modsecurity is still in use on the infrastructure there.

Now to make it really hard for possible digital assailants, extra measures are taken to disrupt their
scanning attempts from the very beginning with iptables

Jason White 10/05 11:06

Excellent, modsecurity is what came up first when | googled waf & haproxy

and ssh keys ate the bottom
so whenever you have time today or tomorrow, we can review that and i hope finish with this task

Also i could not quite figure your scritp used to 'protect' files with sensitive information so i have
worked a solkution with ansible vault.

But we talk about this whenever you can

many thanks

Jason ite 04/04 12:08

@ Cool cool, | wont have time today as there's a lot going on with eventstore and | need to leave early, but
© can see the ansible check mode runs in the pipeline are failing on the PR, so there's something for
you to investigate. Looks like you've still got a coulple of files in the branch to delete - ie the
users_with_password / users_with_ssh_key files.

Hopefully tomorrow | can have a deeper look at it, otherwise we do have another PR review meeting on
Thu morning

Hello Jason.As we spoke about last time, i dont yet have access to all the hosts on the datacenter.But i
wanted to second Greg a bit regarding the scanning of the Linux servers...so despite the stress you are
encountering yourself at the moment with what is going on would you please give me the access when
you have a minute ?

Other than that i really hope things get back to normla soon...i feel the stress just by reading messages
floating around...Jesus !

Jason White 29/12/22 17:15

do it

> two more yaml files named: 'create_users.yml' and 'prompt_ssh_keys.yml' which are in fact called
from the 'playbook.yaml'

Of course there is indeed room for improvement there as the two yaml files above could be moved
towards becoming roles i think.

But i am working through some little bugs here and there which i need addressed before thinking of
restructuring this.

But already you can have a look at the 'playbook.yaml' to see where this is going.

Alternatively we could straight away jump into a session from tomorrow to work on the proposals you
migth have

many thanks in advance

hl Jason.So the script to move the passwords and ssh keys from the current sftp servers (both internal
and external) worked properly. So on the branch sftp_config and in the file 'ac-iac-platform-onprem-
ops/sftp/ansoble/group_vars/all/aftpusers.yaml’,, you will be seeing all the passwords by category

regular username and password hashed on top

Bonjour cher ami Jason! @

From experience, i know that financial institution (Societe GEnerale in France and many other UK
banks) make use of modsecurity as a waf in front of haproxy for security purposes

Not only is modsecurity easy to set up in conjonction with haproxy but it does prove very efficient.

| just sent a message to a former colleague on mine still working for Ingenico in Paris (Ingenico the
french payment processor) and he confimed that modsecurity is still in use on the infrastructure there.

Now to make it really hard for possible digital assailants, extra measures are taken to disrupt their
scanning attempts from the very beginning with iptables

 So there's a bunch of default.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,680
 So obviously, you get standard VPCs,

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,280
 which is the one that you're using, this AWS VPC.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,880
 But there's this AWS default VPC,

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,200
 which is everything that doesn't have a name is a default one.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,440
 So it handles slightly different so that that's

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
 what they need to be.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,560
 Yeah, so it's basically like Terraform doesn't create

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,200
 the resource, but it adopts any management

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,000
 and a default destroy doesn't.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,880
 You can force destroy things, but you

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,800
 don't need to worry about that now.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
 And you can see that just if you're working again.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 Honestly, every single time I'm like genuinely,

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,240
 so I'll have to log into this.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,080
 Like, oh, god.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,580
 Yeah.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,640
 When we were actually looking at the VPCs--

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,600
 I mean, obviously, you'll have seen that yourself.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,640
 So I mean, if you're just looking at the standard site,

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,160
 it's like VPCs, we've got two.

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,480
 If we go and look at all regions,

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,400
 it does say all the ones that you're trying to capture.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,320
 But when you're actually looking at them,

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,560
 you can see like this one's ac.com/failover.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,640
 It's something that we've created.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 We've given it a name.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,400
 Yeah, yes, indeed.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
 This one under here has got to be dash.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
 Doesn't have a name.

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
 But across here, it says yes.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,680
 And this one says no.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,200
 So that's not a default VPC, but this one is.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,360
 So that's like we need to make those default VPCs a default

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,640
 VPC resource.

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,000
 So I think it was from 2020 onwards.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,840
 I think it was--

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
 I'm not going to be able to find it because it did say--

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,440
 does it tell me?

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,200
 Because it told me what it was like from--

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
 it's not going to tell me.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 I think it was like from 2020 onwards.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
 Yeah, so basically, they're just default ones.

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
 So that's why they're all there.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 Just one gets created in every region.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
 Especially if-- I mean, we're not getting paid for it,

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
 charge for it.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 So I don't really know why they do it.

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 And guess just automation in their point.

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
 Because they're all just default ones.

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Guess just automation in their point.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 But yeah, so that's the only thing that only to happen.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
 So if you're happy and you've now figured out

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
 how to get it to work, that's good.

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 So that's basically all I was going to just go through with you

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 is being able to create multiple invider blocks.

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
 But if you've figured that out, that's cool.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 So the only other bit that we'll need to look at

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 is this default VPC.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 OK.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,360
 Can I ask you just one bit of favor?

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 Because as I said, you know, it's--

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
 what I want to do-- now, I just want--

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 I want to propose to do things in two steps.

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 The first step is obviously, as I said,

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 all the other VPCs that are not rewritten

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
 using the format you now have in the testing ground.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
 I want to move all of them there,

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 making sure it is all working.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,360
 And once it is all working as we expected,

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 then I will try to rework the configuration of them

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,360
 using the AWS default VPC, which I showed me.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 Do you think this is a good idea?

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,360
 Yeah, it probably makes sense to do it that way.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,360
 Because you have got it in in front of us,

85
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 and in front of us we wouldn't be touching the other defaults anyway.

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:40,360
 And it should, as I say, be a case of just changing the VPC.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
 Yeah, absolutely.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 Although, in fact, it's in there, the arguments.

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 So that VPC is open.

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,360
 I'm going to give you that one, and there's a standard VPC, AWS VPC.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 Let's hope I just have a look at the difference of them.

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 So basic usage with tags.

93
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 So you've got a default VPC, which has tag name arguments.

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 They first slightly from an AWS VPC.

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,360
 Side or block become an instantaneously arguments come computed attributes.

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 So I don't know if you put these in already?

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
 No, no, no.

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 Yes, I have the side of blocks, but instance tenancy, I don't think so.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 So it looks like once you move across the default, then that side or block goes away.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 And the default value for enabled DNS names is true.

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 So it doesn't look like there's a whole lot.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 I mean, that basically just looks like quite an easy thing to remove out of all of them.

103
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 Force destroy, you don't need to worry about.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 And then I think there's also, because there's obviously bits and pieces that go along with that.

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 I'm pretty sure because you've got default VPC, there are also...

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 Where's all the other bits?

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,360
 Because there's like default VPC, there'll be like default subnet, some things as well that go along with it.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 Yeah, so you get the default subnet.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,360
 So I think they go along.

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 They should go along with it as well.

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 So the default subnets.

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 We won't have any ACLs.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,360
 So I think the only two things you really have is the VPCs and the subnets.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:12,360
 For those other ones, it's just a case of moving across to those resources and deleting the bits that it doesn't need again.

115
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 You'll have probably most of this in it.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 Yeah, so they become computed attributes and you'll take them back out.

117
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
 But yeah, but definitely, yeah.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 So move across to having them all in the right format and in the right folders.

119
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,360
 And then we can worry about switching out the defaults because they're less important than the defaults.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 As long as the Arnold Clark failover and the alien vault ones are working correctly, we can worry about the default ones.

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:54,360
 And this default one, is it for...

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:04,360
 Or if we can maybe go a bit up the page, I just want to make sure if it is compatible with 1.3.7 or if it is only with the...

123
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 Okay.

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 Oh, no, that'll be fine. Yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
 Okay, okay.

126
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
 No problem.

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 Yeah, so I mean that's like the question I think.

128
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:22,360
 So I mean that's right up to two hours ago, but it's been around for years.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
 So yeah, you wouldn't have any issues with the version of Teleform.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
 Okay, no problem.

131
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 Okay.

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 Sorry, Mato.

133
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
 I'm like, can you hear her?

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,360
 People say they can't hear I'm like, no, you must be able to...

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 SESCO!

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:48,500
 No, no, no, no. No, no, no. The dog is not the problem. It is rather myself. As I said, I haven't slept much yesterday night. So I'm a bit there.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,840
 I'm slightly I'm slightly in the clouds today. It's not the dog.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:03,000
 No, no, I'm just like I just feel like I'm constantly tired. I've got the dog within all day, so I just get a headache. And then the tiny man's been getting up during the night. So just feel like I'm like.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,940
 I'm sorry. I'm a bit more grumpy than I normally am and a bit more sure. So I apologize. So but yeah. But yeah, so if if it is the case again, and it's like I know I'm going to go back to it.

140
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:24,600
 It's like if if we do tell you to do it in a certain format and in a certain way, it's like we're not telling you that to be difficult.

141
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:44,600
 And it's like because we know it can be done. So in which it can be because you went away and figured it out. But yeah, and if you're running any problems, and where I've asked you to do something in a certain way and it's not working, then please, please, please, just like pick up the phone or send me a message

142
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 and just go and this isn't work. If you get two minutes just have a wee look. We've got a team to work with. There's there's like a bunch of us. And we've all we've all got experience in different areas and stuff.

143
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 And like just asking the question early on if we're getting stuck with something means that you don't end up doing lots of work that you don't need to like with it.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 And then you're going to have to go back and fix it all again. So if we'd caught that early if we just ask him, go this isn't working. Like, are you sure this is what you want to do?

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 And we've to be able to sort of like.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 I would have asked on Friday. I think unfortunately on Friday I realized you were not in in the afternoon. So this is why I was okay. I sat down and I thought to myself, okay, when I'm putting all of them in one folder, it is not working.

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 So I did my research.

148
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 There's not only me though. I mean, it's like, I know obviously like sometimes you don't want to necessarily do something. But it's like, he is good and he knows what he's talking about.

149
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 Like, it's like, I mean, Zoe was Zoe was on Friday. And he's like a terraform wizard. So I don't know how much experience he has. Obviously Greg doesn't have masses of mine. So he's on the terraform journey as well.

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 But yeah, we are here. And like to ask, even if you don't want to talk to Jason, this is ping him a message. He would have suggested using using multiple provider blocks. And then we wouldn't have ended up having to say we the Royal week is you're doing the work.

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 And having to redo it again. But that's we have a team of people we need to work as a team and be able to actually ask each other. And you don't have to like us.

152
00:11:41,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 But we had a team play. Please use your team and ask questions. Just just to be absolutely clear. I have and I'm sure you know, you know that I have absolutely no issue whatsoever with you know, you Zoe or even Greg or any other person.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 It is just that, you know, I was I was obviously and I know you write you write but on Friday I really thought about, you know, pulling you into to see to see if you could help me but you were not in and I was thinking to myself.

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 Okay, the others are also dealing with their own and task and their own problems. So let me try to figure out. So this is why I spent some time working.

155
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 But that's that's why we end up just going around for days. It's like, honestly, it's like everybody's got stuff on. I send people messages all day every day. And so you'll send me messages and you might not see it in the chat chat.

156
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Yeah, sending messages on the sides just like and like, there'll be times I'll do something and it's like, I've went down a route and I'm like, this seems mental is this mental.

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 And I'll just fire Zoe a message when this seems mental is not working. Like what do you think? Or we'll just pick up the phone. And it like we, yeah, we all do have our own bits of work.

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 But see that doesn't mean that we don't talk to each other in the background or spend five, 10, 10 minutes or in cases we mean Jason because we talk a lot we end up like just blabber nonsense for an hour in the background about other things.

159
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 Because that's how it ends up being like this. That's that is there's a team of us. And you use your team have a chat.

160
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 And yeah, we don't have to work alone. We should we don't need to work alone.

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 Okay, okay, fine. Okay. Cool. Okay. So right, it looks like we're on the right track. So all into one file and into the correct folders get rid of all the sub folders and change the resources.

162
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 And then hopefully that shouldn't take too long. So I'm going to I'm going to estimate Thursday Thursday PR reviews. Yeah, yeah, that should be that should be more than that.

163
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:13,600
 Hopefully, and you can show us the PR and it'll be all nice and a nice shiny just in the AWS folder. And it'll look cool and it will work and it'll be great.

164
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 And if you do run into any more issues, then yes, we are here. Please ask questions.

165
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 No, there are no daft questions. I asked that. In fairness, I asked that questions all the time. But nobody wins at me for it.

166
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 They'll just laugh at me and go, that's stupid. And I know which is fine. It's okay. It's okay. Just ask questions.

167
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 That's what we're here for. Okay. Okay. And sorry for having to listen to my dog. So I will let I will let you know.

168
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 No, no, no, the dog is not a problem at all.

169
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 The dog is a problem. It's also a problem for me.

170
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 And if the dog is causing too much issues, just feel free to send him on on on vacation here.

171
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 I'll be more than happy.

172
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 Oh, honestly, she was a bit. Have you got a nice garden? Have you got a nice garden?

173
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 I would love it. Yeah.

174
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 Well, if there is there is a rather large garden and there is also a forest nearby.

175
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 So, you know, she would love it. She would never come home.

176
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 Oh dear. I don't know. Poor, poor big dog. Right.

177
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 I'm going to do I've been I've been using the tiny humans dinosaurs and putting them because we've got a table at the window.

178
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 So she can jump up on the table to look out the window. The windows all sketch because she's basically sketched out it.

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,600
 But she she I've been trying to put his dinosaurs on the table to try and stop her from jumping up on it to bark.

180
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,600
 It's not really it's not really working. It's not working. It's not working.

181
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 So, bless bless her. It's not her fault. She's she's an old she's an old lady.

182
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 All she wants to do is just relax and sleep comes comes nighttime.

183
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 She just crashes out and just does not move because she's so tired because normally all she would do is sleep during the day and now she's not getting any sleep.

184
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 So she's not getting any sleep. I'm getting a headache and everybody's grumpy.

185
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 So it's frankly, I mean, what I've just said, I know it sounds very unusual.

186
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 I know it does sound very unusual. But I used to have when I was when I was younger, like, you know, back in the days,

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 I used to live in a well, my dad used to have a house where we had something like a mini zoo.

188
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 Like, like we had many type of animals you wouldn't even believe believe someone could have in his house.

189
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 So, you know, I've been taking care of animals for some time.

190
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 So if the dog needs some vacations and some vacations somewhere, honestly, it's not a problem at all.

191
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 Oh, bless. Oh, people, people questions questions.

192
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
 Right. OK, somebody else is asking me questions right.

193
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 So I'm going to jump off. I have PR reviews on the background.

194
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 I don't know if I've started. I might jump on that.

195
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 Is anybody there?

196
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 And if you do run into any more issues, please ask.

197
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 Don't suffer in silence.

198
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 Even if you don't want to talk to Jason, he's fine by chat.

199
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 Just fine by chat.

200
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 You're generally better in chat than by voice.

201
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 It's fine.

202
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 And so he's always here as well.

203
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 So just like, even in Friday, even on Friday, see if you just ping me a message.

204
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 It's like, I know I'm not working, but like, I would still be able to answer you.

205
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 It's like, do keep an eye on messages. So, yeah, do just contact me instead of worrying and going down the wrong route again.

206
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,600
 Okay, so I will catch you in a bit and I'll go and see these messages and jump on the other call.

207
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 Thank you very much.

208
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 Okay, catch you later.

209
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 Bye.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160

 not yet not yet for now what she told me is that tomorrow when she'll be back

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
 we will spend some time trying to you know review a bit the

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
 very review of the the environment and everything but

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,880
 still you know as you as you you've been there for quite some time I thought to

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
 myself maybe it is good to talk to you and and see

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
 how things are going every day you know what are the sort of

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,800
 tasks we're dealing with the the issue we have at the moment you know try to

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 understand a bit what is what is happening

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 okay I mean

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,560
 I'll try for update

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,880
 I'll just share my screen okay thank you so I mean honestly for the most part

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,680
 like compared to other places I've worked this is like one of the most relaxed

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
 place one of the most relaxed places so much so

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
 that I was at rents when I started thinking you know

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
 there was stuff that I wasn't doing that was meant to be doing yeah yeah yeah

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,000
 well to be to be frank I've had the same feeling since last week to be

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
 frank to be honest with you

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,200
 honestly don't worry like we don't we don't work to

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,640
 like timetables okay even even our sprints

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
 aren't set in stone okay so our sprints are just like this is what we're going to be working on

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,840
 um while we're doing it so I've basically just finished the stock db migration

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,560
 okay which was literally just moving a my secret Maria db

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,680
 database from a windows box on one of our Galera clusters

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,840
 all right so so basically doing the tcp dump and going to to to restore that on

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
 briefly speaking yeah I mean there is a lot of other stuff to do so there's

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,320
 there's a windows server called ad center and the reason we just had to be

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
 careful with it is because these are old old windows 2003 boxes

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,160
 oh yeah so these are proper legacy and nobody touches them now

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,000
 all right all right so the database itself was easy enough to migrate

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,360
 um because that is just basically well I tested the applications first against

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,600
 it to make sure that they behaved you know normally okay um and then it was a case

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,960
 of early in the morning um

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,600
 switching me i know dv tables in the read only and then dumping it and then

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,440
 moving it and then changing dns so that was fairly simple

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
 but you just need to get the biggest bit was getting the devs to sign off on it and

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
 say yeah we're happy I haven't thought that because the devs themselves they don't

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,480
 um they don't really touch it so ad center gets an update like once every six

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,600
 months or so okay so again ad center is another thing

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 running on windows 2003 but it's just a java app so i'm currently looking at

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,720
 getting that working on stage web um 01 and testing that out and then once i've

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,320
 got it running i'll get it put into ansible so that we can

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,280
 um deploy everywhere okay um i mean for and that's basically the only ticket i

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,040
 have you can see um so i've basically got three things to do over the next

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,280
 couple weeks um not including anything we've also got uh

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
 there's a

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,720
 so yeah so we've got a support chat as well yeah

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,040
 so yeah i don't know if you've got all the links to it so we've got a separate um

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,960
 pan ban board i guess a separate g-ra group for support requests so somebody

52
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,160
 comes in saying something's broken or um we need this changed

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
 and quickly so stuff that isn't like project work it's more us reacting to

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,520
 something then you've got that as you can see we've got nothing in there at the

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
 moment we don't make it one or two a week

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,760
 um and one of us will pick it up or the other will pick it up and just give it

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
 to one of us to say you know that we give it a

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,200
 split and then get it done

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 anyway okay i mean yeah your first so your first few days

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,360
 you're gonna be tribbling your thumbs quite a bit

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
 um can't think of anything fun to do there's a bunch of videos you probably

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
 have to watch uh like ace learning

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,040
 it's like uh if you go into ace and then ace learning

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,600
 and then click on another link because yeah i i did that this morning i think i

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
 saw that this morning yeah for uh yeah yeah yeah i saw that this morning yeah

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
 yeah so i've probably i've got lens i don't know for true but

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,480
 i mean again nobody really yeah that's a bad thing to stop

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,400
 but it's something you know for you to do

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,520
 all right okay okay i saw that this morning so i'll

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,760
 keep that in mind too too too okay all right okay and and and and and one quick

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:53,040
 question uh sorry so in terms of the uh so beyond the the project uh the

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,600
 project work uh i mean first of all the the the the

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,040
 database migration you you told me about just just now

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,440
 um is there a place where um the the related application is

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,800
 documented or something um no i don't think so

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
 i think for like the ad center um stuff

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 was that

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 where builder i think there might be a little read me's um

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:43,840
 yes they might have a little read me so on um on my individual repos all right

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,560
 okay but there's nothing i mean we don't deal with the

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
 applications so like ad center it's controlled by the web team

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,000
 all right they manage it so we need to just look after the infrastructure for

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,400
 it so we don't really have to worry um too much about the workings of it as long

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,760
 as it is working all right okay okay so so in this case then for you it

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
 was literally literally a case of getting a dump of the

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
 database and moving and moving it across all right

87
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
 and and when you moved it to to to uh to to Cosmo DB you you you mentioned so on

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
 Cosmo DB um did you have

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,080
 a gallery okay yeah so we've got these um prod corp um

90
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,280
 cdb host switch no the prod corp's gdpr stuff we have prod int db

91
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
 those are like our internal database clusters yeah i think

92
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
 um stock dbs now like the only real thing running on these

93
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
 all right um so yeah with which they it's coming from

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
 Maria 5.1 i think something really old

95
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,080
 or 10.1 whoever's on windows 7203 and it's now on 106 so it's on a more

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,640
 recent version um the application itself doesn't care

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,680
 because it's very simple um but now yeah i'm working on getting

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,080
 ad center working in Linux and um just getting everything set up trying to

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
 get it working behind engine x as well because before it was

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,200
 IIF i guess all right okay okay okay yeah i mean if we

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,120
 look at everyone else like they've got um

102
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
 i mean zoe mainly does um like is your stuff

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 okay zoe is very much um cloud based so she rarely touches anything that's on

104
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,120
 premise all right okay um jason and i are more

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
 working on you know the on on board the state stuff

106
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
 um with you know dabbling of the cloud as well

107
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
 okay the aim of the game is to win the game and we'll do everything

108
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
 it's just easier to play to everyone's strengths at the moment

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,760
 so okay and and and and i have the the the the uh

110
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,120
 you might laugh at the question because uh you know i think i would have to

111
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,640
 most likely ask this question to Claire but but taken into account the

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,280
 the uh i don't know the the the project the you know the team has

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,320
 and and and you know the things to come basically the the project we we need to

114
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,560
 to work on soon and and and is there any particular area you

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,360
 think uh i should maybe um focus on maybe because

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,720
 we need more work done there i mean you know i know maybe this is most likely

117
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
 Claire for Claire to answer this question but yeah i just wanted to have

118
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,960
 any um dealings with event store and no no no no this is a just no no no no

119
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,400
 no yeah so mel who left um but i guess you're replacing um she saw looked after

120
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 only events for stuff i've i've read up a bit on it and it is basically just a

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I mean I'm dealing with a lot of the like basically upgrading all the legs to stuff.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 That's been putting my lab so that's what I've been working on.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Jason's looking at upgrading from getting off of Centos because Centos has gone into life this year.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 So we're looking to move to Ubuntu.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's always doing Azure stuff and honestly I don't know what Claire's got planned so you know she might say

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 ignore Event Store and look at this instead.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Okay, alright.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So basically we have from my understanding you tell me if I'm wrong but beyond the areas to which every single of us is assigned

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 there is also a lot of research work so to speak. Am I correct?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Um, I don't know. It's hard to do research on these legacy apps where even the developers like inherited it so nobody knows some stuff but

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I mean, the estates are big. There's a lot of stuff going on.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah, you know for the most part you're only going to be looking at small portions at any one time.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Alright, okay.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So yeah, I mean I wouldn't stress too much. Get to know the company, go through all the learning stuff all the videos.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I mean it's boring but there's stuff like the fire stuff that they want you to do for insurance purposes.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Alright, okay, okay, okay.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Honestly don't stress too much about like not having too much to do.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 There's a lot to do. There's a lot in the backlog. I don't even know how to see the backlog.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There's a whole bunch of stuff that's in this sprint. So there's a lot to do.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Alright, okay, okay.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So a whole bunch of stuff that will eventually get done. So if you want to take and have a look through that, I don't think there's going to be much.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I can see SFTP pentesting, finding, review recommendation, security banner.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Yeah, so there's a bunch of stuff that we set up. We've got some FTP servers that apparently some other car manufacturers want to use.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Again, we set it up and the day-to-day running, we don't involve.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Okay, alright, okay, okay, okay.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Okay, application gateway, cleanup, all projects.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Okay, I see. At least with the backlog, I see where I go.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Have you got a link to the Gira?

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I'm not sure.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So you've got the first one is the support one.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Second one is like the project board.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Okay.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I think, what else?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Have you got an experience with the Gira?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 No, no, no, no, I was mostly working on with AWS and Google Cloud.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But right before starting this neuro, I started to take some courses on Azure.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So right now on Azure, really, I can, as I was telling you, I can fairly easily get some because I've heard that the company is mostly right now.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 The company is mostly writing an application with .NET, am I correct?

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I know there is some rabion.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Okay.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So basically, what I've been working, I've been doing two things basically.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So right now, if someone is giving some source code on whichever application it is, I can easily take that, you know, get the Docker file, build the container, push the container into the Azure.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You know, container registry and use that to deploy on Kubernetes.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 That is all clear now.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And I'm also trying to get to complete a course on administration, like system administration in Azure.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So this is one point.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I mean, I don't think we actually build the containers to build up.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 That's the dev team that do it.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Okay.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So we look after the health of the Kubernetes cluster and we don't flag any issues that might come up.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 All right.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 The actual containers themselves.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 We don't build them.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 All right.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Okay.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But we are expected to publish it.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 If things go wrong, it's a strange term, because, yeah, so really we look after the architecture.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Okay.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So not all the infrastructure, not so much the, like, the workings of the containers or anything like that.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Okay.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Okay.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And in terms of the architecture, this is just another question for my previous roles.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I was mostly working in DevOps team.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And in my two previous roles, the DevOps team was in charge of finding ways to minimize the cost of running.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Yeah.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Is it also part of our traditions or is it?

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Yeah.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Yeah.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 The unique thing with the AnnoClock is that we actually have like two and a half purpose-built data centers.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So the AnnoClock likes to do everything internally.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yeah.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So for the longest time, I say that I've only been here a year, but the story is that they like to do everything internally.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 We've already got these data centers and all this hardware that they've paid for.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So there's no rush to run into the cloud and basically pay again.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Okay.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So we've got some stuff in the cloud and we've got a lot that's still on premise.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so we're a proper hybrid company.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 All right.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Okay.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I see.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The aim, the aim soon though is to have all of our traffic going through Azure as the first point.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Okay.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So all the traffic will go to Azure and then if it needs to come to something internal,

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 we'll just come down one of the express routes that we've got.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So that switchover will probably happen next year or something.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 All right.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I mean, that doesn't really change much for us.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It's just going to have to be aware of where the traffic is coming from.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Okay.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Okay.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Okay.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Okay.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So I'll have just one other question.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You see the, when you were going through the backlog just earlier, I saw there was one

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 task where it was written, what was about dealing with some SFTP server that because of some

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 pain testing, I think, yeah, that happened on that.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So, I haven't opened that.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,560
 Well, I haven't, obviously it is important to open that ticket and see what it is saying.

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,440
 But just like that, I haven't opened the ticket here, ticket here.

105
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,040
 If I were to maybe access the backlog and go on that SFTP server, the first question

106
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,800
 I'll have to ask you is, do you think this SFTP server is running on-prem on the Linux

107
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,920
 box or do you think it's more Windows box from your experience?

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 It'll be on-prem.

109
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 It'll be a Linux box.

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
 Yeah.

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
 All right.

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:19,160
 So, to solve that issue, for example, if I were, for example, to log into that SFTP server,

113
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,880
 just trying to find out how it is set up.

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,520
 So, maybe checking which ports are open, checking if it is updated regularly and trying to see

115
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,800
 if maybe there is a possibility to implement some security measures for that specific box.

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,080
 Do you think this is what is expected from us if we were to deal with that ticket?

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 This is my question.

118
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,280
 No, I mean, we, it's set up.

119
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,680
 The PEN test will have its recommendations, which are actually pasted in the ticket.

120
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,400
 Our Sinclair will update it when we move it into the live queue.

121
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 Yeah.

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:07,200
 I mean, yeah, so if you do do the ticket and you have a look and you see the recommendations

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,880
 and then obviously you make the changes that are required, but if you do have any other

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,440
 suggestions, yeah, just raise them in the, you either raise them in the ArcOps channel

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,880
 or during our stand-up at the end of the day and all that, chat about it, or something,

126
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,480
 if you think it needs more than like a five, ten minute talk, you can always just like

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,240
 arrange a call and you can all just hop on a call and discuss it.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
 Okay, okay, all right.

129
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
 Okay, okay.

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,720
 Now, I understand better when you're saying that we are the ones dealing with the architect

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,680
 word D. Yeah, I understand better.

132
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 Okay, okay.

133
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
 Yeah.

134
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,080
 I think there might be, I mean, we know that there's some things like you've got a couple

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
 of users who for whatever reason refuse to use keys, so they're using a user name and

136
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 password.

137
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 I mean, no, that's not recommended to them.

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
 Apparently the manufacturer is being adamant.

139
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,280
 And so this is like the only way that they can move the stuff.

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 Okay, okay.

141
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,240
 I mean, if they, I mean, out of the blue just like that, if this is what they're doing,

142
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,880
 you know, maybe, you know, we can ask them to confirm whether the connection is maybe

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,360
 always coming from the, I don't know, I don't know yet, but I will ask them to find out

144
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
 from where the connection is coming.

145
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,480
 Is it coming from one of their own servers or is it one of the employees trying to connect?

146
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,720
 I mean, trying to understand and maybe from that, from that, if I were to delegate that

147
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,960
 ticket, my suggestion maybe would be to try to see if we are sure, for example, that the

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,920
 connections are all the time coming from the UK or from a specific region.

149
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,960
 Maybe one security measure we can put in place is, you know, trying to see if we can implement

150
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,920
 some IP tables that would allow specifically these IP addresses and nothing else.

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,280
 And obviously, prior to implement these IP tables, trying to see if we can write maybe

152
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,480
 a batch script that will make sure that the necessary ports are always accessible just

153
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
 in case.

154
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 Yeah, this is one suggestion.

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 We've got like proper firewalls.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
 We rarely have to do things at a server level.

157
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 All right.

158
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
 Okay.

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 I mean, I would hope that it's locked down the specific IPs, but I don't know.

160
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:36,480
 I mean, we, a lot of times, they'll ask for stuff to be set up and we'll give recommendations,

161
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 but the company doesn't always listen.

162
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 All right.

163
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 Okay.

164
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
 Okay.

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 Yeah.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,200
 I mean, really, really, that was, you know, that was, you know, what you showed us, what

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,520
 you showed me and what you told me that was really, really useful because now I have a

168
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,240
 better idea on, you know, the sort of works.

169
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,160
 So basically, is it right for me to assume that I would say 70 to 80% of the tasks we're

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,560
 dealing with are coming from this backlog channel?

171
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
 Yeah.

172
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,880
 I mean, once we are filing, that's when like clear all this stuff out.

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,880
 So if you're setting with three or four things still to do, she's not going to throw more

174
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 stuff at you unless it's urgent.

175
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 So for the most part, you're only going to have a few things to do every two weeks.

176
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 Okay.

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 Okay.

178
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 All right.

179
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 I mean, a lot of the things are not quick.

180
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
 So a lot of things take turns.

181
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
 Okay.

182
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
 Okay.

183
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 All right.

184
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,880
 So you told me you've been with our network for about a year.

185
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 Yeah, last October.

186
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 Oh, that's great.

187
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 And what is the thing you did for, what was the, what did you find the most difficult to

188
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 cope with in terms of the work we're doing?

189
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 Yeah.

190
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Yeah.

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 What I mean, for example, for example, in my, in my previous role in France, you know,

192
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 basically the, the aim was to help normal path group to become, you know, you know, ISO

193
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 2701 compliant.

194
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,880
 And, and, and to be frank, you know, surely you've heard about the French culture.

195
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,880
 You know, change is not, you know, the, the acceptance and management of change is not

196
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 the strength of.

197
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 I've only been to San Marlowe.

198
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 So I've not been.

199
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 San Marlowe.

200
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
 Okay.

201
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 Okay.

202
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 But, but, but to be honest with you, the, the, the, the France as a country and my fellow

203
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,880
 French, my fellow French, you know, you know, they tend to be very resistant to change.

204
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 So the biggest issue I had in that role was actually, and believe it or not, was actually

205
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 trying to convince the, the, the board of the, I mean, the senior managers to even accept

206
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 the idea to become GDPR compliant.

207
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 It is a requirement by law for them to do that above all since a lot of French companies

208
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 did suffer some massive data security breaches, but still, still they, they will see it as

209
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,880
 some, some sort of, you know, they will be very annoyed to comply with the law.

210
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,880
 It's unbelievable that that was the most difficult part in, in the job release.

211
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,880
 So, so whenever you need to start, when you start, starting the audit was, was very difficult,

212
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 you know, implementing the, the, the conclusion from the audit was even more difficult.

213
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 So the difficulty really was trying to convince them every day to, to, to move along with the

214
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
 thing.

215
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,880
 So, so my question was actually in the same direction.

216
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,880
 What is the most challenging part, I would say, of, of the day to day task we, we have

217
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
 to accomplish because I can already see one thing I can already see is,

218
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
 I don't know.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,880
 I mean, it's, it's pretty, just dealing with legacy apps is probably my biggest thing because

220
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 no one knows anything about them.

221
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 No one knows how, how the intricate details of how they work.

222
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 Okay.

223
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,880
 I mean, I mean, I think that that's just unique to the issue.

224
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 But otherwise, I mean, I still don't really know, like Terraform, like I've edited Terraform.

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,880
 But when I get to the point of writing in Ansible and Terraform for these, the new AdCenter

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,880
 servers, that's going to be like my first real dive in the writing Terraform from scratch.

227
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 Okay.

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
 I'm still learning.

229
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
 Oh, right.

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
 So I came from AWS myself.

231
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 Okay.

232
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 And puppet.

233
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 So not even Ansible.

234
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 So it's been, yeah, getting to learn technologies.

235
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 I mean, there's way of being remote, but previously I was like on my own, like the only IT guy

236
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 in the company.

237
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
 Oh, a lot of stress.

238
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 Yeah, the last few jobs.

239
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 Yeah.

240
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 But that's not true.

241
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 Before here, I left, come pick up, EEC and a Clelf.

242
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 Because I was on my own, I wanted to be part of a team.

243
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
 And I joined Enable.

244
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 Do you know Enable?

245
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
 They used to be SolarWinds.

246
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
 SolarWinds, yeah, not SolarWinds.

247
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 Yeah.

248
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
 And so with me and then the rest of the team were all in Belarus.

249
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 Oh.

250
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
 So I joined them and I was like, okay, great.

251
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
 I'll get to be part of a team again.

252
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 We'll be about chat and everything.

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,880
 And obviously, like the language barrier was just too much.

254
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
 I see.

255
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 So after six months, I was like, you know, I think this is working out.

256
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
 So that's why I'm.

257
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
 I see.

258
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 This is not.

259
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
 I'm just happy being part of a team again.

260
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 I'm having people chat every day.

261
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 You know, they were about sighted me as a people.

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 Yeah.

264
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 Yeah.

265
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 I see.

266
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 I see.

267
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 And in terms of the learning, Claire told me that we have, I think, subscriptions to O'Reilly.

268
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 Yeah.

269
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 I think I don't know what you'll be able to send those details out.

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
 I don't know if I've actually got an O'Reilly login.

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,880
 Oh, so you'll get a login for it.

272
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
 Okay.

273
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
 All right.

274
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 Okay.

275
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 Okay.

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
 Okay.

277
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 And how did you find, how did you find the, how did you find the, the learning with O'Reilly

278
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 so far?

279
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 Because I, me personally, I started looking at it.

280
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
 Like, I came from AWS.

281
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 So I've worked for the zero a little bit.

282
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 So I was trying to go through all, honestly, I've sort of stopped.

283
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

284
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

285
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

287
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

288
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

289
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

290
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

291
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

292
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

293
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

294
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

295
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

296
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

297
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

298
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

299
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

300
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

301
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

302
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

303
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

304
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

305
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

306
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

307
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

308
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

309
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

310
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

311
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

312
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

313
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

314
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

315

 I've been looking at it for a long time.

364
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

365
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
 I don't know. I think it's just

366
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
 the cost.

367
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 You can see here.

368
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 This is just one of the sites.

369
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
 This is just one of the sites.

370
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 I don't know what the other

371
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
 Jason will tell you.

372
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
 1-6, the East South Street,

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
 or Cabela and so on.

374
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
 As you can see we've got 2.2 THz free

375
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
 of CPU

376
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 12TB free.

377
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
 I don't understand why we've got so much.

378
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 I don't understand why we've got so much.

379
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 We've got 179TB free

380
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 of storage.

381
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 We've got loads of

382
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 CPU.

383
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 We've got another one of these as well.

384
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
 Server side was the

385
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 I forgot which one's the newer one.

386
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 Oh Jesus.

387
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
 What?

388
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 Yeah.

389
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
 We've put all this money

390
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 in time into these data centers.

391
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 That's why there's no rush

392
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
 to move to the cloud.

393
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
 Yeah.

394
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
 People go to the cloud because

395
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 you know

396
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 if you're starting a company

397
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 there's no way you would do all this now.

398
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 Yeah.

399
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 They've already got it in place.

400
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 So again 1.7THz

401
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
 9.89TB

402
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 is free of memory

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
 and 138TB is free of storage.

404
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,880
 There's a bunch of, we're running

405
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 old bunch of stuff that

406
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 we're probably never actually have to look at.

407
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,880
 There is a focus on being

408
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 cloudy when we can.

409
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 At the end of the day

410
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 we don't have to be.

411
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 We could just

412
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 pull back in and run everything locally.

413
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,880
 I think for

414
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
 redundancy states

415
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 being in a cloud data center

416
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 is better.

417
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 I think back in the day

418
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
 or years ago

419
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 it was less reliable

420
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 like your own data center

421
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 especially the ones I know

422
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 got a bill.

423
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 I don't know why they're in

424
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 Zooer for Kubernetes. I'm guessing just because it's easier to manage.

425
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
 Like the cost

426
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
 of having someone come in and manage a whole Kubernetes cluster

427
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 when you can get Microsoft

428
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
 to do it for you as part of the cost.

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
 All right, I see.

430
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 When you are given a ticket

431
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 to deal with an application

432
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
 and

433
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
 when you don't find the documentation

434
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 who do you talk to in order to at least

435
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 have an idea

436
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 on how it works

437
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
 and is it more to the

438
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 developers or

439
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 is there a...

440
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 Yeah, so the developers are

441
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 splitting the different teams. It's like the web team

442
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,880
 I don't know

443
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 what we want to pull up.

444
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 But I know there's a few teams. There's like the one vehicle team

445
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 there's the web team

446
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 I think those are the only really two teams that we have to speak

447
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 to day to day.

448
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 So those

449
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 if I needed to know the ins and outs

450
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 I'd speak to them. But a lot of the time

451
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 if it's the newer stuff

452
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
 then that's all going to be documented with the new get repo.

453
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
 The other stuff

454
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 they just don't know.

455
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 They're just like, what else?

456
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
 They have to go in the new stuff and look at the config files

457
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 and try and get a general gist

458
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 as to how it's operating.

459
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 I mean, look at AdSense

460
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 for instance, it's just a single jar that runs

461
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 so it's not

462
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 it's not going to be difficult to move

463
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 it's just going to be testing

464
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
 testing it to make sure it all works as expected

465
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 because it's on an engine jam version as well

466
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
 so I'm going to have to try and pull that up

467
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 so we might need to get the devs to make some tweaks

468
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,880
 to the code

469
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 we'll see

470
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 Don't stress out, you've got nothing

471
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 you have nothing to do. It's going to be a very

472
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 very soft launch

473
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
 I mean, it took me

474
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 like eight months before

475
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 I even started having to go on call

476
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 so

477
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 I don't think you have to worry about it too much

478
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 Okay, alright, okay

479
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 Really, thank you

480
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 thank you so much Greg

481
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 for taking the time to...

482
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 I mean, you should be able to call anyone on the team

483
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 or at least ask anyone on the team

484
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 and be like, got questions about this or that

485
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 Yeah, no problem

486
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 Adjacent comes off as like

487
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 rash and

488
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 like opinionated

489
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 and he is

490
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 he's got his opinion as to when

491
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 or how things should be done

492
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 so if you believe strongly in

493
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 differently

494
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 you have to fight your corner

495
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 Yeah, no problem

496
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 No problem

497
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 You've probably seen from our stand-ups

498
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 that we'd like to have a good complaint

499
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 sometimes

500
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 on what's going on in the company

501
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 I noticed

502
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
 I noticed

503
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 I noticed

504
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
 It's been

505
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 very chilled

506
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
 which is different from where it was previously

507
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 where the sprints were

508
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 hard deadlines

509
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 and I had to

510
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
 go on with it

511
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
 Yeah, yeah

512
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
 The only thing

513
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
 I did find

514
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 I did

515
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 I found

516
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 a bit... well

517
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
 I have some slight regrets around

518
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 is the fact that, you know

519
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 the laptop I have

520
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
 I mean, when I was asked if I wanted

521
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
 a Mac or Windows

522
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 obviously, I told them

523
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 okay, I'm gonna go for a Windows

524
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 with the idea

525
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
 of installing maybe Red Hat

526
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 or Debian or something like that on it, right?

527
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 But then, to access the

528
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 Oh, no, yeah, you have to

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 go with our prints

530
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

531
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
 But yeah, I mean

532
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 I don't know if it's too late to change

533
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
 but, yeah, speak to Claire

534
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 Yeah, I spoke to Claire because

535
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 the Windows is not is

536
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
 you know

537
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 Yeah, I didn't know if you're like

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
 "Oh, have they set this up on the Windows?"

539
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 I thought, "I have no idea"

540
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 I was from a Mac, so I'll act

541
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 I use it

542
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 Okay, yeah

543
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 I've never, to be frank

544
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
 with you, for most of my

545
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 for the past decade or so

546
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
 I've been mostly using

547
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 Linux laptops for work

548
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 but I know Linux and Mac are obviously

549
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
 very close to each other

550
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 and Mac at least is stable

551
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
 because the Microsoft laptop

552
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 I have is already crashing

553
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 and it's so sad, it's such a powerful machine

554
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 like, can you believe it? 64GB

555
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 64GB of RAM

556
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 and

557
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 You've got 64GB of RAM in yours

558
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 I have 64GB of RAM

559
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 on my laptop and 16 cores

560
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 can you believe it?

561
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 In the tell that they just gave you

562
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 Yeah, yeah, 64GB of RAM

563
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 I've got

564
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 I've got 16GB and

565
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 6 cores, i7

566
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
 and Mac and Mac

567
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 and Mac is only like

568
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 I mean, this is a server, I was talking to

569
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 my colleagues, well, I was bragging

570
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
 basically, I was talking to

571
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 one of my former colleagues and I said

572
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 he asked me, he said, "Hey, so Marcel, how are things

573
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 going in the UK?" I said, "It's great, you know

574
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 I'm working for this amazing

575
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 company, guess what, I've got a laptop

576
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 with 64GB of RAM" He said, "What?"

577
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 He said, "Maybe I should apply" I said, "Well, try

578
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 try it"

579
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 but he was also very

580
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 he was, I mean, I found that very impressive

581
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
 and I checked, the laptop is worth

582
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
 something like 7000 pounds

583
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 which is, Jesus

584
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
 so, you know, yeah, so

585
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 because of that, you know, when I finish work

586
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 I keep it, why I keep my money

587
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 literally because you know, I cannot

588
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
 I cannot afford to

589
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
 Why you keep money on you?

590
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 You can't even make a bank account, you only keep cash

591
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 anymore? No, no, I still keep

592
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
 just a little bit, you know, not too much

593
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 like 200 or 300 pounds just in case

594
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 you never know, so I keep

595
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 the laptop, yeah

596
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:33,880
 Me, you know, maybe I'm a bit old school

597
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 in that regard but

598
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 there were a few times in my life

599
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 where the

600
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
 I had issues with the car and so on

601
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
 so, since then I thought to myself, okay

602
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 I just like

603
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 you, I don't use cash to pay

604
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 but I always keep

605
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 just a little amount, you know, somewhere

606
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 just in case, you know, just in case

607
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 the card is failing or, you know, God knows

608
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 what could be happening

609
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
 so I just keep, so I keep the laptop right there

610
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
 but it's a, yeah, it's a

611
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 it's a very powerful machine, this is a server

612
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 in fact, yeah, it's really sad

613
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 it is running Windows because

614
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 God knows what you could do with that

615
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
 Linux or even Mac for that matter

616
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
 but, well, that's another debate

617
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 okay, so Greg really, thank you

618
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 very much for your time this morning

619
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 thank you very much for helping me

620
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
 to have a better

621
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
 understanding of that

622
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 Yeah, that was pretty easy

623
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
 and just, you'll be doing videos

624
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 and all that

625
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 I don't remember what I was doing

626
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
 for the first couple of weeks

627
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 it's just a lot of reading

628
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 and creating videos

629
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,880
 yeah, I think I have

630
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
 a call with Jason to go over the infrastructure

631
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 and that, so I don't know if Claire's

632
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 going to arrange that as well

633
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
 yeah, if you have

634
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 such a call with Jason

635
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
 if obviously, if the two of you don't mind

636
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 I wouldn't mind joining just to, you know, to listen in

637
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 and see...

638
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 I've been talking about like a year ago when I started

639
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 I had a call with Jason to cover infrastructure

640
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 ah, okay, okay, okay

641
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 yeah, in this case, yeah

642
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 because she said that when she will be back

643
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 tomorrow

644
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 we will have

645
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
 a call with Jason

646
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
 to talk about the infrastructure

647
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
 she did mention that

648
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
 I mean, I imagine it'll be with Jason

649
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
 because I've been here a year

650
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 but there's still stuff that I don't know

651
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 stuff that I find out

652
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 in like abbreviations

653
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 that, you know

654
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
 you're just like, okay, that's what that stands for

655
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 but yeah, you'll learn something

656
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
 every day, at least

657
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 yeah, yeah, yeah

658
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
 because we did

659
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
 okay

660
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 okay, so really

661
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 Greg, thank you very much for your time

662
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 and obviously, if I have

663
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
 some other questions

664
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 then you just compliment

665
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 I'll write you a message on

666
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
 so I've probably got plans for lunch today

667
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 for lunch today

668
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 I don't know, maybe I'm just going to have

669
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
 some salad because I'm trying to lose weight

670
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 a bit, you know, you wouldn't believe it

671
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 but I am 110 kilograms

672
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
 well, I've got your beat on that

673
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 oh, really?

674
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,880
 I think

675
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 I have around 112

676
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 I'm aiming to get down to like

677
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 80 or something like that

678
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
 I have the same issue because

679
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
 I have some of my family members calling me an elephant

680
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 so, you know

681
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
 it's not nice from them but that's what they're doing

682
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 so

683
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
 and obviously

684
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
 in my family, we have

685
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
 a lot of people

686
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
 have suffered and did suffer from

687
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 high blood pressure

688
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 and things like that so I need to be

689
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 careful so that's why I want to

690
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 try to lose a bit of weight

691
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 that's a very good question

692
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
 so I'll tell

693
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
 I don't know where it is

694
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 I mean in terms of who has the best Jalof

695
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 in West Africa

696
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 Ghana and Nigeria

697
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
 are always fighting over who has the best Jalof

698
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 I wonder

699
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
 is Ivory Coast sitting there

700
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 thinking well, they're both wrong

701
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
 in that specific regard

702
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 some Maivurian people

703
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 would tell you that the Ivory Coast

704
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 is the best in terms of Jalof

705
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 but to be frank

706
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 it's not true

707
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
 Nigeria

708
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 and Senegal

709
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
 regarding that specific

710
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 and that I think they are most likely the best

711
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
 but

712
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 the Ivory Coast has some other

713
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
 specialities

714
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
 that are also very famous

715
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 there is one we call

716
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 Aloko

717
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
 I don't know

718
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 maybe

719
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
 if

720
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
 providing you can eat anything

721
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 I can try to see if I can maybe

722
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
 arrange the next time

723
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
 we go into the office

724
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 maybe I can try to bring some and you will try

725
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
 and you will see

726
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 Aloko

727
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
 is basically

728
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 fried plantains

729
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
 but it is done in a way

730
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
 that it is

731
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 I've tried that with

732
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 some Japanese friends

733
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
 Russian friends, British friends and so on

734
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
 they've all liked it very much

735
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 and I believe this is the

736
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 specialty of the Ivory Coast

737
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
 but regarding the Jalof

738
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 the Ivoryans would brag about being the best

739
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 but they are not

740
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
 I think Senegal and Nigeria are the best from far

741
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
 not Ghana

742
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
 to be honest

743
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
 I don't think so

744
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 I truly believe

745
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 the one from Nigeria

746
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 and Senegal are the best

747
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
 from very far

748
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 but

749
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
 I'm not saying the one from Ghana is not good

750
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 this is not what I'm saying

751
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
 but

752
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
 the Nigerian Senegal are

753
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 a bit outclassing everyone else

754
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 but

755
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 I wouldn't say that loudly in front of

756
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 some of my foreign people

757
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 they might curse me

758
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 for that if I were to say that in front of some of my foreign people

759
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
 but the truth is

760
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 this is the truth to be frank

761
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 ok thank you very much for your time

762
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
 sit in the car

763
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 no problem thank you very much Gregg

764
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
 thank you a lot

765
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 you too, thank you

766
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
 you

767
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,540
 (air whooshing)

768
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,300
 (slurping)

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 the Linux servers are actually doing and where they send the emails, whatever that is fine.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
 I know, I know, but if they want to have a discussion.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
 The operational emails, the reporting emails.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,800
 I know.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
 Colin did actually mention apparently there's some concern about customer data.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
 So there's no customer data coming out of those emails.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
 The only thing we had with customer data was that builds server which has gone now.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
 Yep. No, I don't know.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,400
 So like I was giving him that.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,440
 I was like fair enough. It's saying that every single is like opening up a huge section.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,160
 That's cool. I don't mind.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,920
 You can have a chat, but I was like, I was like, there's no, there's no network rules here.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,080
 This is basically, and it was like the question was, it was like, it's fine.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,160
 All I need is no network rules.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,200
 We're just using 365 as a really for Prisma Cloud and all I need is the Prisma Cloud email address

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,080
 enabled again, to send like it used to.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,680
 And they're like, oh, that, like, would it work?

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
 Like two factors needed for 365 emails.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
 No, not all of them.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,400
 You don't have to be.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,960
 We can make it.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,360
 So yeah, now I have to have the phone call about that.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
 So, yeah.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,480
 Yeah. So, I'm still going to be working on this.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,720
 So this is going to probably end up bigger than what Ross and that started out with.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,360
 And because we've got to look at the encryption stuff and I was having a chat

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040
 recalling about it this morning.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
 Apparently, what the what's the sort of?

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,800
 Oh, sorry.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,040
 I know I just started waffling on about database users that automating database users when we're

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,920
 creating the databases.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,320
 So like the, the, the, the database users is probably the simple bit, but there's obviously

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 certain databases have like encryption required.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,760
 So that will have to get tacked on somehow on top of it.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 And then Colin, Colin's obviously wanting to review the actual accounts that are there

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,160
 because there was some people that had like DBO to start off with.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,680
 The BI team, somebody created them, one after sales guys or somebody had created them at some

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,360
 point, a data services reader and they were hooking directly from on-prem to

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
 does your databases to pull data.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 And obviously that's not supposed to be happening.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,760
 And isn't that, no, no, it's like, if they were doing it, they would be looking at a view

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
 at the, at the most, but they weren't.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 It was a user on the work on stuff directly from databases rather than a view.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
 So that I, they shouldn't have a reader.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,480
 So like God knows how that happened.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,920
 Yeah.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,080
 So I would need to, why don't we just turn on encryption for all the databases by default

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,480
 anyway?

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,240
 Well, see that, that might be where we go.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
 But obviously Colin is one.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,200
 That's what I'll very likely end up doing with, with replacement canary pastures.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
 We prove a concept of that with that, that BI replica cluster.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
 Yes.

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
 That rest encryption.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,000
 I couldn't get TLS working.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,520
 I think now that it's been a few years, I could probably get that going.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
 Yeah.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,000
 So I saw obviously like Colin wants a bit more input around about the database.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,320
 Stuff, which is fine because that's don't have an issue with that.

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,800
 Dave's.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,720
 So the plan for that after sales event store stuff is next Thursday night, Greg's on call.

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
 So we'll leave it to Greg.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
 I'll do that.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,320
 I mean, it should just be a case of taking, stopping the nodes,

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,880
 changing the config, turning the other three nodes, well, all the nodes back on,

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,160
 and they should just all sync up.

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,440
 I don't think there's any more complicated to that.

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,320
 It should just work.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,520
 Might take a while for them to sync back up.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
 It should get there.

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,080
 Yeah, 10 pages.

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,640
 I might.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,120
 Yeah.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 So I've estimated two hours on that.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,800
 So there'll be an outage window at night.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
 I don't even think, are you being holiday next week anyway?

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,240
 I know.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
 It'll be more than two hours.

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,120
 Possibly.

80
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
 It'll be interesting.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 And like you'll need to kick it off and just go to bed.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,320
 Basically, there's no point sitting around waiting for it.

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 It could take all night and into the day.

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,960
 It's been that long since they were synced up.

85
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:29,680
 Obviously, it was a lot quicker when I did it, but there's no guarantee of that.

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
 Yeah.

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,720
 Would it be easier dumping the data?

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,640
 I don't think it would be any easier dumping the data.

89
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,880
 But can you do that?

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,200
 I don't know.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
 It's not a database.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,760
 So I don't know how it works.

93
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
 Oh, no, it's a database.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,240
 So technically--

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,040
 Oh, sorry.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
 It's not a database that I'm familiar with.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,160
 Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,640
 It's not a SQL database.

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,560
 I can't run my SQL dump against it.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
 No, no, you can't do that.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,920
 So I think I would just stand the back up and let them sync up.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
 It's not really a database though, anyway.

103
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,760
 Sort.

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
 Well, sorry.

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
 Sorry, not by--

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
 So I will do that.

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,040
 You've got your stuff that you're doing.

108
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,240
 You're picking up stuff and sorting yourself out.

109
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 Yeah, just--

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
 Adding stuff as I go to.

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
 Keith, you're still doing the ECM stuff.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,040
 How much have you got with it?

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
 Like, how are you getting on with it?

114
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 Oh, it's going on ground.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
 I think there's much left of the initial config.

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
 Cool.

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
 Yeah, the bigger bits, the setting up, the apps in that.

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,480
 And I found out talking to the Red yesterday,

119
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,920
 apparently the code for the image core and scale that's in GitHub

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
 is not what's running in production.

121
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
 Because last time he tried to make a change,

122
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,240
 Craig couldn't get it to work, which was like three or four years ago.

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
 That was the Java thing that I was thinking of

124
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,200
 when I thought that they were trying to run

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
 AdCenter or something while Linux and got stuck.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
 I think it was--

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,480
 Red had just made a change to the image crawler or scaler,

128
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,560
 and they couldn't get it working.

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
 Yeah, but there's that there.

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
 And so, yeah, the work in there is that the stuff that's in the ECM

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,320
 and image fintech repo needs to get the same treatment

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,520
 as what I've done to web builder, stop builder, AdCenter feeds,

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,680
 and that move them to DevOps pipelines for each,

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,320
 like one for the scaler, one for the crawler,

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,760
 and then probably one for the various scripts.

136
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,520
 Or I kind of talked to Keith about this,

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 like maybe batching up related scripts,

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
 unless they're all related and watch the case,

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
 they all just get released together

140
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
 because there's not really a built process there.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
 It's just really deploying.

142
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,520
 And also, the assets, the JavaScript and the PHP stuff,

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,320
 so they can all be deployed by pipeline

144
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,080
 and work in a similar way to what I'm doing with the AC.com stuff.

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
 So virtual machine and basically more config,

146
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,680
 which Keith's sort of tying off at the moment.

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
 And then there's application config,

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
 which I'm saying with the same inverted quotes,

149
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,400
 which would be like any kind of web config,

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
 a web server config, any secrets.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,600
 And config files for the Java tasks in particular,

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,040
 that will come out of the Ansible AC.com repo,

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
 like all the other stuff is.

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
 And then the AC image feeds repo will then be like,

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,400
 that's the apps that are being deployed.

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:33,920
 So yeah, very much just try and mimic what I've started doing with AC.com anyway.

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,800
 So there is a bit of work left there.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
 Cool, should we write this down?

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
 Should I write this in this ticket?

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
 Because that was a brain that are like,

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 do you want to write it in that ticket?

162
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
 Because you just spat out a whole load of things.

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 I suppose I could do something.

164
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,080
 Yeah.

165
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
 I've talked to Keith about it, so.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
 Yeah.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,240
 Cool.

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
 Okay.

169
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,640
 Right, so I've still got that.

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,960
 So that's at least another two weeks worth of work anyway.

171
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,840
 Marcel, I tried to split up those tickets.

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,520
 So what I did was I renamed the old ticket

173
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
 to terraforming the AWS VPC.

174
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,200
 See this, how you already had a branch that had that code on it.

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,600
 I created another one that was basically just like a starting ticket.

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
 Yeah.

177
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,720
 For you to just capture like, so obviously VPCs, EC2s,

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 and like anything else that we need to capture.

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
 So if we just get a list in that ticket,

180
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,520
 we can close that one off and then I'll create new tickets

181
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,400
 based on the resources so that we can split the mail into tickets

182
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,320
 and create PRs for each individual bits for the AWS stuff.

183
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
 And then that means that we know exactly which bits

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
 that we've still got left to do in that

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
 and make them smaller tickets.

186
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
 Instead of just going like terraforming all of AWS.

187
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

188
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,200
 So I don't want to repeat that.

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
 Which was, yeah, yeah.

190
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,840
 So once you've tidied up the branch that you've got,

191
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,360
 we can get a PR and have a wee look through it

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,400
 and see if we want to tidy up anything before we merge it,

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
 which would be cool.

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,400
 So you've still got some stuff there.

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,480
 And Zoe, you're doing the clusters, Prisma, Cloud,

196
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
 you can't really go any further on now.

197
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
 Because emails.

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,000
 So you've been...

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
 There's some other conflict to look up.

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
 Yeah.

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,080
 I don't know, I could probably get a small ticket.

202
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
 Yeah.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
 Well, I think for the next two weeks,

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,160
 so there's obviously, I think, what there were certain...

205
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
 Because I've only got next week and then I'm on holiday for two weeks.

206
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
 Yes, so, yeah.

207
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
 Well, we can see what comes in then.

208
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,680
 What I was going to say was there's obviously these new,

209
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
 really golden signal things.

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
 Oh, yeah, okay.

211
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
 So I would just start picking these up

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
 and just see how they would apply to the,

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,080
 to, I guess, the example app.

214
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,120
 I mean, we've already got some of these things in place.

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,400
 It's just how we pull that out into a module that the devs can use

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,560
 for their apps, just to make sure that everything's monitored.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 So I guess that would be the next one.

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 And then...

219
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,640
 Okay, cool.

220
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,200
 That would sort you for a week.

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
 And then, I guess, at some point, we get to look at

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,800
 the Zero Trust in Kubernetes sort of stuff.

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,360
 Oh, yeah.

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
 But we'll have a bigger discussion about that as a group

225
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
 and just see where we think we're going with that as well.

226
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
 I don't remember that director's thing.

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,840
 Ignore that for now.

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
 I had a chat with Ross.

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
 So he didn't realize it was paid for.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,520
 So when I had a chat about that,

231
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
 he's just going to keep it in a database now.

232
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,080
 He's going to just stitch the director's stuff.

233
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
 So it's not free?

234
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
 No, no.

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
 So it's like, it was free for...

236
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,960
 It was direct us, wasn't it?

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,520
 Direct us.

238
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,680
 Because he was like,

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
 the self-hosted one's completely free.

240
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,520
 I was like, it's completely free.

241
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
 Because he hadn't clicked in this tab.

242
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 So it was completely free for up to $5 million.

243
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
 And you're like, well, we go over that.

244
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
 So we'd have to pay.

245
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,640
 So I was like, this might not actually be that expensive.

246
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
 And I was like, in the cloud version, it's like $99 a month.

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
 It's really not that bad.

248
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,040
 I was like, all you need to do is just get them to give you a price.

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 And then right up a proposal of what you're putting in it

250
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
 and how much it costs.

251
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,080
 And I'm sure somebody will say, oh, he's like, I can't even do that.

252
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,880
 I can't even do that.

253
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
 I'm like, I'm expecting it.

254
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
 I'm like, you do, you do.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
 So if he doesn't want to do it,

256
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
 and he just wants to stick it in the data, he's that same.

257
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
 And then, but yeah, we would have had to pay for it.

258
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
 And somebody would have had to sign off.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,960
 And even getting this, somebody would have had to sign off.

260
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
 And then I'm like, yeah.

261
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
 Because it had just been like, I even the data in it,

262
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,400
 it's like three of our names and like being able to manage,

263
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,560
 to patch management and updates and stuff

264
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
 so that they could keep track of it.

265
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
 But I mean, he can do that in a database.

266
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
 He just wanted the UI.

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
 He says, so.

268
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,200
 So that's, I don't, so I think in that case,

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
 I don't think there's really much else.

270
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
 Everybody's got stuff.

271
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,960
 Yeah, Jason, you can, you can decide with Greg,

272
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
 what Greg does when he comes back,

273
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,440
 which servers that he should pick up if he's,

274
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,320
 if he can remember what it was that you had a discussion about.

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,120
 And we'll start getting him doing some migrations,

276
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
 to go on to as well.

277
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
 If it's the Galeric clusters, then cool.

278
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,680
 That's probably a good one.

279
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
 He's got quite a bit of experience with that,

280
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm sure do love going back to them.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
 But it's what makes sense.

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,960
 It's what I know is how they hang together.

283
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
 Yeah, yeah, I think I probably need to be involved

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
 with some bits anyway, but.

285
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,840
 Yeah, but you do like to be involved with all of them, Jason.

286
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
 Sorry, what?

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
 I said, you do like being involved with all of them,

288
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
 and to be in the big switch.

289
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,600
 Well, no, it's just, I mean, obviously,

290
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,520
 I'm not very good at writing things down.

291
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,760
 And like just much, just recently in the last couple of weeks,

292
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
 I've been doing a lot of work that's directly related

293
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,840
 to the Galeric clusters with the character set stuff

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
 and shit like that.

295
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
 And then also remembering that I wanted to do things like TLS

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
 and that, which was tricky, which I couldn't get

297
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
 to work the first time around.

298
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
 So like, yeah, I want to try and set that stuff up as well.

299
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 But yeah, that's also just, it's like, particularly with things

300
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
 like the ATO proxies and the Galeric clusters.

301
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
 But yeah, could get them to do the images service,

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,400
 because really that just rails servers.

303
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,440
 Yeah.

304
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
 Get those done.

305
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
 Yeah.

306
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
 Possibly the big cash servers as well,

307
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
 since AC images being done.

308
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
 Can do the big cash and stuff.

309
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
 I keep all the other stuff together.

310
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,080
 Yeah.

311
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,320
 Or they could be keys next targets.

312
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
 True, true, unless he wants to break from images.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,200
 I would get to know how it all hands together

314
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
 though at the same time.

315
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:32,960
 Yeah.

316
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,560
 So two through five, I think of the images to servers.

317
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
 I think that just rails apps servers.

318
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
 So that'd be easy.

319
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,120
 That'd just be cooking kind of what I've done with AC.com.

320
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,080
 Images one, a prod images one,

321
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,120
 my real images one.

322
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,240
 That's like, I think they're basically just serving images.

323
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
 And then the Vcaches are caching images from AC image to serve up.

324
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,400
 So that'd be like three separate sort of migration jobs, I think.

325
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,920
 That's like, I don't think.

326
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,480
 Nope.

327
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 Yeah.

328
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
 So that's like, I.

329
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,840
 But yes, I do like to be involved.

330
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,640
 It's like, the only person, I mean, I'm the only person left

331
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,680
 that has enough knowledge about our Linux systems

332
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,320
 and where we're sort of planning to go with it.

333
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
 I will, will the bits and pieces,

334
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,480
 it's like all the historic bits and pieces that just, I, it's like,

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,200
 at all.

336
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,920
 Since JL left, I've been able to just figure out so much more of it.

337
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
 Yeah.

338
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,960
 It was quite a block working with Craig and JL on retrospect.

339
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,680
 I was not able to really learn enough because they had the

340
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,440
 rigid ways of wanting to do things which I didn't always agree with.

341
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
 And I know you've done that in them.

342
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
 Well, yeah, I mean, anyone's way of doing it, someone's going to

343
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
 disagree with for sure.

344
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,560
 And I'll disagree with my own work when I look back on it, I'm sure.

345
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,880
 There's no even at those.

346
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
 But it's also just like, you know, they've got to be interesting workers,

347
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
 well, so I never had a chance to really learn much.

348
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
 So since, yeah, since JL's left, it's just been like, oh cool,

349
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,960
 well, this shit's easy.

350
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
 There's nothing to worry about.

351
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
 It's all simple.

352
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,920
 Why did we make it so, why did everything have to be such a bit

353
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
 complicated mess to those guys?

354
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,400
 Yeah, I think it's the same.

355
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,120
 It's always the same.

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
 But it's like, you always worry.

357
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,520
 It's like, because we've had that previously, people leave you like, oh my

358
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,560
 God, how are we going to do this?

359
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
 And you're like, no, it's fine.

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
 Yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,160
 And then you learn stuff.

362
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,800
 You learn stuff.

363
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,280
 That's cool.

364
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
 And I've seen that from the outside.

365
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,120
 Whenever like Craig and JL left and go, oh my God, that's fine.

366
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,760
 We're pretty skilled people.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,200
 We're pretty good at figuring shit out.

368
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
 We'll be fine.

369
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
 Yeah, no, it was always fine.

370
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
 It's always fine.

371
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,880
 We always adapt and learn and we get better for it.

372
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,520
 That's just cool.

373
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,160
 So it's all good.

374
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
 Cool.

375
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,120
 Cool.

376
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,360
 Okay.

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,600
 Right.

378
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 Go, go do things.

379
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,120
 Go be happy.

380
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,000
 Almost lunchtime.

381
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
 Get a cup of tea.

382
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,400
 That Halo Tenders bullshit should be working now.

383
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,240
 Oh yeah, I did notice that.

384
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,000
 I don't know what it was.

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 I haven't gone back to them all over anything, but I just closed it and put

386
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
 them out saying that it's been opened up.

387
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
 I could see in the proxy it's been on green.

388
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
 So a student's working.

389
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,960
 Anything that's not working on those servers I don't really care about.

390
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,400
 Yeah, it's like I knew this was broken and I left it because no one asked for it.

391
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
 There was a symbol.

392
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,360
 It was just because for whatever reason that's been deployed to the 10-150-233 network,

393
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,040
 which the 232 and 233 networks were open to each other previously,

394
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,560
 but a firewall has been put in front of the 232 network and we just

395
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,400
 hadn't had a request to open those particular servers up.

396
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,560
 Yep.

397
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
 Aye.

398
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,960
 So aye.

399
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
 I knew it was broken.

400
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
 Didn't care because Dumbledore didn't ask about it.

401
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,760
 Previously, no one had told us to open it back up.

402
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

403
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,120
 Yeah.

404
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
 I don't even know if he'd had permission to get it open back up.

405
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
 Well, technically it was never down.

406
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
 No.

407
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,560
 Yeah, it was not down.

408
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,800
 It was just that because they put this firewall in which broke everything immediately.

409
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
 And that was one of the bits where I was like,

410
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
 "Ah, tell me, you're going to do this stuff.

411
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,560
 You've just cut off like AC.com from everything."

412
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

413
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,000
 Oh, aye.

414
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,480
 That's cool.

415
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,800
 Yes.

416
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,080
 No, that's it.

417
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,880
 Everyone else can go.

418
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,040
 I was like, "Everyone else can go."

419
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,520
 That's fine.

420
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,920
 Yeah, no, that's sad.

421
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,120
 I don't think I'm getting a house.

422
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
 Yeah, cool.

423
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
 And yes, I will catch you all later, I guess.

424
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
 Yeah, catch you later.

425
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
 Go to it, does that?

426
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 Short and sweet.

427
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,720
 Right, go.

428
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
 Bye.

429
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,920
 Bye.

430
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
 Bye.

431

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
 Hello, good morning, Zorin. Good morning.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
 How are you?

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 Ah, like an old man, you know.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
 Sleepy.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 Yeah, well, it's worse than that, you know.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 I think I'm really suffering from old age, you know.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 I think it is a bad time.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 Maybe I'm gonna talk to our managers and retire soon.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 [laughs]

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 That would be nice, wouldn't it?

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 Absolutely, yeah.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 You can't be that old, be yourself though.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 Well, believe me, most people don't believe how old I am.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 Really?

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 Yeah, yeah. How old do you think I am? Really?

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Um, I don't know.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 Maybe like 40 something.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Right.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 Okay, so just say a number. Just say a number.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 No, I don't know.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 But I know in the UK it is a very sensitive subject,

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 but honestly, I'm very open-minded.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 Just say a number, honestly.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 Okay, I'll go middle range. I'll go 46.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
 Ah, no, I'm not 46. I'm 42.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 [laughs]

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
 But this is really old, you know. This is really old.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 Back in the days, people used to retire at that age.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 Oh yeah, like eight years.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
 Back in the old days.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 [laughs]

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 For sure that's not that old.

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 Yeah, but it's not that young too.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 [laughs]

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
 And I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it.

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Just the way you were talking there,

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 what you were going to be, you know, older.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 Yeah, but honestly,

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
 well, it's only when I start to talk about old age

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 that people start to ask themselves questions.

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 But frankly, you know, last time when we went to the office,

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 and that was my first time, someone asked me the question,

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 and they told me, "You look like 34, 35."

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 I said, "Oh Jesus, thank you very much.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 I am not 35."

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 He said, "You can't be older than that."

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 I said, "I am much older than that."

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 He said, "Prove it." So I gave him my driving license.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 So really, that must be fake. I say it's not fake, it's real.

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 [laughs]

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 To be fair, I wasn't even really guessing on the way you actually look.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 I was just guessing because I know you've got like children,

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 so I was like, "Well, I can't be that young."

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 Well, some people, you wouldn't believe it,

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 but I sort of became grandfather, you know.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Okay, let me tell you how.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 So my cousin, like my direct cousin,

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 the daughter of my father's sister,

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 literally, my cousin,

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 unfortunately, she passed away in 1991,

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 and back in the day, she had one daughter,

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 so we started to take care of her.

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 So she calls that because of the African culture,

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 she calls us dad, and me and my brother, she calls that dad.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 Now, she's got kids, and guess how the kids are calling us?

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 [laughs]

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 You see, granddad indeed.

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 So I became a grandfather without even realizing it.

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 [laughs]

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Quite a young granddad.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 Yeah, yeah, quite young.

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 So every time I see them when they call me granddad,

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 people are like, "What is going on here?"

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 That can't be real.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 Yeah, exactly.

77
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 They say, "What is going on here?

78
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 Was it 10 or something?"

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 Like, "No, what is going on?"

80
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 [laughs]

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 It's very young.

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 And Zoe, before we start, I have one question.

83
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 How do you manage to...

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 It sounds like a stupid question,

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 but how do you manage to remain so calm?

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 [laughs]

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 No, really, because there are a few things I find disturbingly annoying.

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 Honestly.

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 And I'm wondering how you manage to remain so calm.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 Do you have special techniques or a special short of breath

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 that helps you?

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 [laughs]

93
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 You know what, I just put myself on mute

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 and then you can just say what you want, really.

95
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 Ah, that's your question.

96
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 I just do it out as well a lot of the time.

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 I can't handle a lot of it.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 Wow, wow, wow.

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 Because I don't know how...

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 Okay, okay, so I'll follow your lead on that,

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 because sometimes I don't know.

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 I'm going to be very honest with you.

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 Sometimes I don't know.

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 I really don't get...

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 Sorry, but I know Jason is facing some challenges,

106
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 but the way he talks, including to our manager and so on,

107
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 I'm wondering how...

108
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 Sometimes I'm asking myself questions.

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 How do you manage to be so calm?

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 Like, this is amazing.

111
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 Honestly, like, wow.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 Yeah, like...

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 He is actually all right.

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 I do agree, like, he doesn't talk very well,

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 but see, if I raise the point and have something to say,

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 he is quite nice to me.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 [sighs]

118
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
 So I find it difficult, because...

119
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 Like, yeah, he just goes...

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 He rants and rants and rants and rants and rants.

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 Only time, Jesus.

122
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 But, you know, he'll go through a phase,

123
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 and like, next week, he'll, like, not talk at all.

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 So, and then you'll be...

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 You'll have a nice few weeks,

126
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 and then you'll forget about all the crappy bits.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 He just goes through a lot of phases.

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 But yeah, because I find it, like,

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 it's kind of different for you.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Well, not just now, but because, especially him and Greg,

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 like, they're doing a lot of the on-prem,

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 like, work, and I'm really not involved in it.

134
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 So as soon as they start to talk about that,

135
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 I just literally don't even really pay attention.

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 You might not be quite in such a position

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 where you can just ignore all what they say about that stuff.

138
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 So that does make it easier for me.

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 Honestly, you know, I think...

141
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 [sighs]

142
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 Well, okay, okay, I think I'll take your advice there,

143
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 you know, whenever this is happening,

144
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 I'll just have some short read and hope for the next week

145
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 to be better.

146
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 What can you do?

147
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 I don't know, like, it clear, it's quite good

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 at sticking out for her as well, so...

149
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 No!

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 Sometimes she'll just take it,

151
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 and then sometimes she will pick her battles.

152
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 I think she does know.

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 Yeah, no, even Claire, I don't know.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 Honestly, like, quite frankly,

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 I've been with you for, what, like,

156
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 a little bit over a month now.

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 Honestly, I'm not saying that to be polite,

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 but I'm just saying what I think here.

159
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 I think Claire, honestly, she's...

160
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 I don't know who her husband or partner is,

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 but he's very lucky, you know,

162
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 because the way she's able to remain calm,

163
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 you know, despite the sometimes tone of voice

164
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
 I find completely inappropriate and things like that,

165
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 I do have a lot of admiration for this woman.

166
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 Honestly, like, some days, when she will expect the list,

167
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 I'm gonna also ask her the question,

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 "Claire, what is your secret?

169
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 What sort of short breath are you having?

170
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 There is a thing you do."

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 You need to tell me, there must be a secret.

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 No, really, it's unbelievable.

173
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 I mean, for me, it's a lesson of...

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 in self-control.

175
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 Not that I lack in the self-control,

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
 but, you know, I've encountered very few people

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 able to remain calm under such circumstances.

178
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 Like, no, this is most unusual.

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 I think she deserved the Nobel Prize for Peace or something.

180
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 The Pro-Pace Keeping.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 Yeah, and I think as well, like,

182
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 just when I started, there were a few other members of the team,

183
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 and I think they were all really quite difficult.

184
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 And I think Jason's, like, the only one left from that team,

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 so I think it actually used to be, like, a lot worse.

186
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Oh, Jesus, really? What is that?

187
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 I don't know, it was just, like, a lot of strong opinions,

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 and people, like, when you did a bit of work,

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 people would, like, disagree a lot with the way you did it,

190
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 and there would be, like, a lot of debate

191
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 and a lot of chat about certain things.

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 But even, well, you know, having strong opinions

193
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 is not a problem, you know,

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 but they need to be backed by facts.

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 Like, you know, when I see him, like, downplaying the work,

196
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 the security teams and so on are doing,

197
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 I mean, this is not right, like, you know,

198
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 I mean, these people, they're doing what they can

199
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 at the end of the day, and they most likely have, you know,

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 some policies they have to stick to.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 You see what I mean, like, in the book?

202
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 Yeah, security are rubbish, though.

203
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 Like, I do agree, like, the way he talks about them

204
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 isn't very nice, but they are very good.

205
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Yeah.

206
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 And if you want to get to work with them,

207
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 if that ever happens, you will quite see.

208
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 Like, I do agree, like, they do have a job to do,

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 and obviously they've got their own stuff going on.

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 It's difficult for them, especially right now.

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 But, like, before when I worked with, like, one guy,

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 I would have, like, a meeting every two weeks or something like that,

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 and I pretty much, it was the same meeting every two weeks,

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 and I would tell them exact same things,

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 and he still, like, wouldn't understand what was going on.

216
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 I... well, these are most likely information security people.

217
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 Yeah.

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 It is difficult, but, like, again,

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 I don't deal with them that much anymore,

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 or something like that, but he just likes to go on a rant

221
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 about things like that.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 This security thing is probably the biggest one, so...

223
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 Okay.

224
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 We'll get him some vodka or some whiskey.

225
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 He's gonna cool him down.

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 He doesn't drink, but yeah.

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 We'll find some tricks to get him to drink.

228
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 He'll become happy again.

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 Okay.

230
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 So, Zoe, yeah, so, as you were mentioning yesterday,

231
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 you spoke about an account that was used,

232
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 that was used, or that is used for the...

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 TerraFar automation on AWS.

234
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 And yesterday, when you were talking,

235
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 I think you went on to a repository

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 where there was a piece of code that was run by that user.

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 Am I correct?

238
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 Yeah, I'm sure.

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 Like, I can't remember...

240
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 Did we go over, like, the pipelines with you before?

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 We went briefly over the Azure DevOps pipeline.

242
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 Yeah.

243
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 Yeah, so, like, I can show you, like, so...

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 Just now we have, like, this pipeline, for example,

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 which is just an elastic search to me.

246
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 Like, it's just an AWS.

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 There's not a big, like, resource or anything like that.

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 But this works in Azure DevOps.

249
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 So, it must...

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 Where's the pipeline?

251
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 Yeah.

252
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 Like, it is, like, it can see that there's been changes

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 being made and stuff, so I'm pretty sure it works like as in...

254
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 I'm sure I've added at least IPs

255
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 and removed them for whatever reason, like, changed them.

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 So, yeah.

257
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 Like, are you...

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 Have you created, like, a branch or anything yet?

259
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 No, no, no, no. I mean, on the AWS side,

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 all I've done, all I did first of all was

261
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 trying to find any, you know,

262
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 users with the right privileges,

263
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 able to run some Terraform scripts.

264
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 I did find two with Terraform in them,

265
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 but they hadn't...

266
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 The...

267
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 Both hadn't been used in, like, a couple of years.

268
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 So, this is why I thought to myself,

269
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 maybe it is better to, you know, to set up a new one.

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 So, I created a new user with the name TerraformUser

271
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 with the right privileges in order to use that to, you know,

272
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 to design all the Terraform script for all the elements

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
 we have on AWS at the moment.

274
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 And once tested and once I know it is,

275
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 at a minimum acceptable, I'll start to check them

276
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 to check them into the GitHub repository.

277
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 This is the plan ahead, really.

278
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 So, we do have this service account.

279
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 This is the old one.

280
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 So, I think that's the user that should have been used.

281
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 So, SCArk/Obs.

282
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 Okay, okay.

283
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 Okay, so, let me see.

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 If I can see that user there.

285
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 One second.

286
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 Sorry, my laptop is a little bit slow,

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 but it's going to start actually, so I'll have to update it.

288
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 Okay, where is the signing?

289
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 One second, I'm trying to, yeah, sign.

290
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 No, what is that?

291
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 Okay, I am using it.

292
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 Just putting my ID.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 Next.

294
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 Alright, so make.

295
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 And press right.

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 So, just key in the password and it will be the,

297
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 the, yeah.

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 So, it is going to be 664, that sounds like a lot of things.

299
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 Okay.

300
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 So, when I go into IMUsers.

301
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 So, it's SC.Ark.

302
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 Okay.

303
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 So, SC.

304
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 Yeah, I can, let me share my screen and show you that user.

305
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 So, you should be able to see my screen now.

306
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 So, yeah, I got that user.

307
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 Okay, okay, this one here.

308
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 Yeah.

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 Because it is disabled console access.

310
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 Yeah, so, like, it has actually, like, it's been disabled.

311
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 We can't use it, but that was the account that was being used.

312
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 Yeah, and it doesn't have that.

313
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 So, I don't know what to do, to do the, should we, I don't know.

314
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 Take the.

315
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 Like, I think it would be fine just to use it again, but, so,

316
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 it might be better to, like, you move it to this new user that we have,

317
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 which is basically the same user with just the cloud version of the account.

318
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 Just to keep it consistent with everything else.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 Because these accounts are being used to, like, run all our pipelines

320
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 and everything like that anyway.

321
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 So, great way to make sense to add it.

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 So, okay, so, in this case then, as these, I think this user is,

323
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 but it was used yesterday.

324
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 Yes, that's what I mean.

325
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 The pipelines probably run still, so.

326
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 Okay, so.

327
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 Because it's like an AD group, I guess, like, it doesn't care that what AD says about it,

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 but an AD is gone.

329
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 Okay, so, I'm not sure what to do here.

330
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 So, should I just try to change the policy for that very specific account?

331
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 I'll send you the name of this new user, right?

332
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 And if you want to create, like, the same account, or, like, the same permissions with an account with that name or whatever.

333
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 Okay.

334
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Okay, I'll try to see if I can.

335
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 No, no, I don't think I'll be able to create another account with the same name

336
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 because I think the system will most likely refuse it because this one is already.

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 It's not the same name, it does have AC1 at the start.

338
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 Is there any somewhere though?

339
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

340
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 There is a one here, yeah.

341
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 Yeah, AC1.

342
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 Okay, okay, so let's do that then.

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 So, I'm gonna forget about the, I'll try to disable the account I created yesterday,

344
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 and I'm gonna create a new one with the right privileges and with that name.

345
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 And then if you add it, once you create, like, an access key, you can add it to Key Vault,

346
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 but maybe it would be better if we can just chat through that bit after you've done that if you want.

347
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 Okay, no problem, no problem, no problem, let's do that.

348
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 I'm gonna do that way, okay.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 Okay, so, okay, so thank you very much for your time today.

350
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 No worries.

351
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 Enjoy your first day.

352
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 The day where we first did, so we're having beer and whiskey.

353
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 I had a few beers last night, so I've got to...

354
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 Ah, excellent, excellent, well done.

355
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 I had just some water yesterday, Jesus, like that.

356
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 Okay, so...

357
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 Sometimes you need a drink coming out of that call.

358
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 Sorry?

359
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 Sometimes you need a drink coming out of that call.

360
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 Yeah, okay, okay.

362
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 Yeah, you will be fine.

363
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 Okay, so thank you very much.

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 You're welcome.

365
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 So thank you very much for your time today, and are you gonna be coming to the office on the 12th?

366
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 Okay, okay.

368
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 So, do you think Claire will...

369
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 Do you think we can force Claire to go to the pub instead of the restaurant on the first day,

370
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 and I don't think it's appropriate for a new employee?

371
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 The only problem with going to the pub is there's no pubs around the office.

372
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 Ah, yeah, it's true.

373
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 It's true that it's only garages and...

374
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Yeah, it's more difficult.

375
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 But we should arrange to go to the pub sometime.

376
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 Absolutely, absolutely. Ah, some whiskey at last.

377
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 We're running out of whiskey in sterling, you know.

378
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 Oh, really?

379
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 I finished all of it, yeah.

381
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Stop by.

382
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 So let me know once you clear that up, Claire,

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 and we can go through the pain-tied part if you want.

384
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 Okay, no problem, no problem.

385
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 I'll do so.

386
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 It's not gonna take me long.

387
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 Just a few minutes, okay.

388
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 Okay, okay, sorry, thank you.

389
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Bye-bye.

390
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
