Hey folks, off a call with Dave K.

We have made the decision to Under 23 month dismiss Marcel - he's not worked out and we
have no room for passengers right now.

David Middleton: Are you good to start the conversation with the People team?
Claire : DK asking if we need to replace but we can think about that and come back to him.
Cheers

[25/05/2023 10:50] David Middleton

Hi, | see Claire is off today but before | talk to people team does marcel know from explicit
conversations there is an issue with his work because that will be their first question
[25/05/2023 10:52] Claire Thomson

Hiya, just saw this
[25/05/2023 10:58] Claire Thomson

I've had chats with him to commit his work various times, That what he's attempted to do wasn't
in line with what we were trying to do, so | tried to be more explicit in what | was asking. | guess
it's more of an overall thing. I've had occasions where Zoe has discussed how to structure the
terraform but then he asks me after it, He seemed to take it personally when Jason said that we
shouldn't be writing bash in ansible - that we should be using ansible modules for example...
Marcels reaction was to say there was a module for bash - but that doesn't mean it's right - it's
not what we should be doing - use the tools the way they are intended

[25/05/2023 10:59] Claire Thomson

| guess it's everything as a whole - with so much experience | don't think we should need to
guide him so much

[25/05/2023 11:00] Claire Thomson

| don't know exactly what | should have said to say there was an issue, | couldn't go no that's
totally wrong, it's been trying to course correct | guess

[25/05/2023 11:02] David Middleton
Thanks Claire, from an HR perspective we haven't had an explicit 1-2-1 that he isn’t meeting

expectations was what | was meaning. | thought that was the case but want to just be sure of my

facts is all
[25/05/2023 11:03] Claire Thomson

No I've not had an explicit 1-2-1 in that regard

[25/05/2023 11:05] Claire Thomson

if your both free just now it might be easier to have a call?

[25/05/2023 11:06] David Moffat

Back to bed and get better Claire- can talk more on Tuesday on this. Can wait till then.
[25/05/2023 11:10] Claire Thomson

| guess this is the most recent chat in teams | had with him

[Tuesday 11:55] Claire Thomson

remember to push your changes to your branch

[Tuesday 11:56] Claire Thomson
I'm gonna stick a recurring meeting in your calendar for the end of the days hahaha (I won't

really )

[Tuesday 11:58] Marcel Sangare

(will push Claire ...i was intending to do so by the end of the day..i am just testign a few bits and
pieces before doing so...but i will...

like 7

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have
an idea before i push this afternoon.

Title of ebook of origin: 15.exchanges_claire_moffat_others_about_me.pdf

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them
down , each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them
into a single folder as requested by you last week:

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

Selection 418.png

[Tuesday 14:13] Marcel Sangare
The reason why | initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are

considered isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for
scalability and strict isolation from each other.

[Tuesday 14:15] Claire Thomson
so there should only be one variables file and one outputs file - these are going to be the same

inputs and outputs across all VPCs - this is why pushing to git helps - then! can pull the branch
and look at the code and discuss it rather than looking at some file names on a screenshot

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed...it will be as you mentioned below:

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc- 1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

so there will be a single main.tf, a single variables.tf and a single output.tf

131

Title of ebook of origin: 15.exchanges_claire_moffat_others_about_me.pdf

[Tuesday 14:21] Marcel Sangare

But in order to make this easier, iam breaking the individual configs along these lines before
merging into a single folder

[Tuesday 14:23] Claire Thomson

most of the variables will be in your files to start with anyway as it's not a module so it's defined in
the code

[Tuesday 14:26] Claire Thomson

we don't need things isolated, | get the original idea - but we want to be able to run a pipeline
across them all - check for changes etc - no manual running of anything

[Tuesday 14:27] Claire Thomson

terraform has -target to allow you to specify which parts of state you want to change/destroy if we
need to

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

yes i understood the idea you had in mind when mentionign this.

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

{ pushed just now the changed on three vpc so that you can see

[Tuesday 14:29] Marcel Sangare

it is on branch INFRA-675/AWS, for vpc-010c0d84db3 1a1d1b, vpc-0232b16b, vpc-439e2c26

insiode each there is a folder called "config_broken_down"

Selection 418.png

[25/05/2023 11:11] David Middleton

Thanks Claire, sorry i didn;t know you weren't well. I'm all good here
[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

and this was from the Friday.

[Friday 09:29] Claire Thomson

Please remember to push your local commits to git it's good practice to push at a minimum
at the end of the day, if you were off sick for example someone could pick up where you left off

[Friday 11:07] Marcel Sangare
Good morning Claire.Sorry you are absolutely right.It is just me and my silly habit of pushing only
what appears to be the best...bad habits die hard but something i do need to rectify indeed. i was

trying t make the comments as consistent as possible. | am just finishing the vpc_accounting script
that will be pushed today as well

[Friday 11:09] Marcel Sangare
so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS'", under "aws", there will be a folder

"vpc terraform version 1.3.7" with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version
7.3.7.

[Friday 11:33] Claire Thomson

why? this should all be in one folder, it's all still in separate folders?

It should be along these lines as discussed

AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc- 1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Friday 11:35] Claire Thomson

it should be "= 1.3.7"

[Friday 11:44] Claire Thomson

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right

[Friday 11:45] Claire Thomson
push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that

just say "Typo"

[Friday 11:45] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed.So i first rewrote all the individual terraform configs using 1.3.7, tested them thoroughly .

[Friday 11:46] Marcel Sangare

the organization you mentioned above was mentioned by Zoe.i will do that next ..

[Friday 11:46] Marcel Sangare

tam on it now as well as the vpc accounting

Thanks! makes it so much easier to read, then we should be pretty close to that PR and getting
VPCs out the way and on to the next resource

[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

no worries

[25/05/2023 11:15] Claire Thomson

As | said it's more of an overall thing, for his experience, we expected more - sorta what |
mentioned to you already. it's like he's at a junior level, and | get not understanding Ansible or
Terraform, and things taking a bit longer - but everything seems to be so long and just the
though process around things seems odd, even just the basics like pushing to git...

[25/05/2023 11:16] Claire Thomson

the whole thing makes me feel bad - he's such a nice guy and the start he had was terrible with
the incident but where do you stop - | don't think | could trust him to do BAU.

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson

maybe that's what | need to do - | don't know how long we have - but put him on BAU only for a
couple of weeks and prove he can't even do the basics

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson
take ansible/terraform out the equation
[25/05/2023 11:19] David Moffat

I'm looking back at his CV - he's not showing us any of the things he listed under his skills

Marcel Sangare - CV 1.pdf

 

[25/05/2023 11:19] Claire Thomson

| now feel even sicker than | did It's not nice, | want people to do well and it feels like a
failure on me that I've not assisted him enough

[25/05/2023 11:20] David Middleton
It's cool don't be stressing claire! | will talk to people team and you can focus on getting better

| mean he can write a bash script, | don't think he's not capable of that
[25/05/2023 11:22] Claire Thomson
OK, I'm gonna try a cuppa

[25/05/2023 11:30] David Moffat
Claire Thomson

| mean he can write a bash script, | don't think he's not capable of that @)

This is the kicker:

SKILLS

-~Change Management, Project
Management

-Cloud (Openstack, Google Cloud, AWS)

-Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Strategy,
Network Security, Cyber Defense
Automation, Penetration Testing,

OWASP, PCI-DS5S, NIST Framework,
50C management, Firewalls, Exploit
Reverse Engineering...)
qm - DevOps (Gir, Ansible, Nagios, Jenkins,
Gradle, Maven, Terraform)
-Big Data (Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Flume)
-Advaneed System Administration UNIX
(BSD), Linux (Red Hat, Debian)

-Seripting (Python, BASH)

We've seen nothing from him in "DevOps" - given experience / salary it's not been good enough.
He knew he was coming to a DevOps role - made very clear to him in interview so please don't
feel bad Claire - sometimes it just doesn't work out, we're not going to get 100% success rate

Marcel was hired as a replacement headcount for an experienced engineer in the team. The
roles and responsibilities of the role he applied for made clear he would “Utilize
infrastructure-as-code to deliver automated, predictable and scalable solutions,
infrastructure and services” and “Evangelise automated, fault-tolerant and secure
developments and practices”. Of the work Marcel has produced to date we don’t believe he
has the competencies to complete these two responsibilities in particular.

Marcel continues to struggle with distributed version control systems. The team has
provided multiple repeated explanations in 1-2-1 sessions and in written Teams chats on
how these systems should be used to enable the team to collaborate. Our using of version
control systems is the standard industry way of working namely to work in a feature branch
and commit small changes continually. It is critical for everyone in the team to work in the
same way especially when we the team works in a hybrid of office and home working. After
multiple reminders most days Marcel is still not able to follow this process and rather sends
screenshots and emails which slows down and distracts the Team Lead and the other
members of the team.

As explained at interview the focus of the ArchOps team where Marcel applied and
currently sits is to support the delivery of our strategic objective to move our software
deployment infrastructure architecture to that known as “Infrastructure as Code”. The tools
we use to deliver this are Terraform and Ansible. Both tools are industry standard tools for
this work and Marcel stated on his cv and at interview that he had experience with. Marcels
performance to date indicates that his competencies with these tools are at best limited and
not up to the requirements for the role he was hired to undertake. Tasks which take other
members of the team days to complete are taking Marcel weeks which is well below the
performance level expected of someone with his stated experience. Of particular concern is
Marcel’s inability to not use raw scripts but create reusable modules to complete work. This
is a fundamental principal of the strategy we as a department are looking to follow and is
having a significant negative impact on the team’s ability to operate and the work that
Marcel is producing.

Given the above we believe there isn’t a role for Marcel in the department given the natural
way Marcel likes to work and his level of exposure to the tools we use. Marcel was brought
in as an experienced senior engineer and as such we would expect him to take autonomous
ownership of some of the tasks of the team. Given our time with Marcel to date we don’t
believe that is going to be possible.

Current Task - Identify all AWS resources and add to source control.
The task originally was to identify all AWS resources and add them to our source control
system. Marcel was instructed to work from a branch in a designated repo, look at our

existing structure, create a new AWS folder and add the code to it.

The first concern in this task arose when Marcels first attempt at lead him to try and script
the creation of the terraform.

139

Title of ebook of origin: 16.communication_between_hr_and_claire.pdf

Terraform is a tool to create Infrastructure as Code. The end goal of this task — all our tasks,
is to use the tools to automate the creation of the infrastructure.

Marcel was course corrected to make sure he understood that his thinking was incorrect, he
reasoned that if someone was to spin up new resources we could run the script to capture it
in terraform — | corrected that by reinforcing that no one should be clicking the buttons to
create the resources manually — that they will be created in the code, approved and ran via
a pipeline.

Realising that the task needed to be more focused it was then broken down further to focus
solely on VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud)

Marcel tried to create the VPCs but created each part of them individually, reasoning that it
would allow us to manage each bit separately. | had to correct his course again — | explained
that a VPC consisted of multiple parts that were linked and should exist and be managed
within the same file — as we could not possibly recreate a VPC without destroying all the
resources that existed within this. | highlighted this by showing Marcel the Resource Map
that exists in AWS.

Marcel has had ample time to review our repos and look at the AWS interface and with his
experience realise how infrastructure has dependencies on each other.

Macel had another attempt to restructure his work and then paired with his colleague Zoe
to review it. Zoe highlighted issues with the structure, the version being used and how the
state file worked (that we did not want them individual)
Following that Marcel then called me, questioning what Zoe had said. | reiterated that she
was correct — and this is what t had previously explained that we wanted a single VPC folder
with them all in it.

Having explained on calls and in the chat the folder structure that was expected, what parts
of the code had to go where, screen sharing and dragging and dropping files as an example
to show this had now turned in to a drag and drop exercise to refactor what was there, | was
still met with having to go over it yet again on our catchup — that the settings were to
remain in the file and not in the variables file.

Marcel did say that he’d misinterpreted a previous comment in the chat (19 folder
structure) but it had been followed with the example on the call, and the comments in the
chat on the (23)

Throughout this as previously mentioned, I’ve had to remind him to push changes to github,
not to send screen shots when asking me to assist, these are just the reminders in chat,
others were issued verbally.

Commits were infrequent and often one or two lines or words were changed in a period of a

few days — this work rate is below what | would expect, even from a graduate or
apprentice.

140


--- New Page 5 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 16.communication_between_hr_and_claire.pdf

If | had given this task to anyone else on the team it would have been completed within a
few weeks.

This is in addition to a previous attempt at a task which had similar course corrections and
misunderstanding of the tool and how it should be used (ansible), that while it can runa
bash script — that we should use the collections and roles designed for it and only use
custom scripts where absolutely necessary.

| feel that at this point I’d have no confidence that Marcel could perform a task that came in
on our BAU board without a lot of support and guidance.
