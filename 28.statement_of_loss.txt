Statement of Loss
To the attention of the employment Tribunal - Case 8000485/2023

Object: Statement of Loss

Your Honour,

Pursuant to the directives issued by you during the preliminary hearing, | (the Claimant
Sangare M.) would like to submit my statement of loss as it pertains to the employment
tribunal claim against Arnold Clark. This document aims to outline the financial and
emotional impact of the series of events leading to, and following, my unjust dismissal from
my position at the company. As a dedicated employee from December 2022 until the end
of June 2023, the abrupt and unfair termination of my employment has not only resulted in
significant financial loss but also inflicted considerable emotional distress.

The purpose of this statement is to provide a detailed account of the losses | have incurred
as a result of wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, direct and indirect discrimination,
harassment, whistleblowing, and victimization. These claims are grounded in both Scottish
and UK employment law, which recognizes the rights of employees to seek redress for
such grievances.

In the following sections, | will break down the various components of my claim,
quantifying the financial impact and articulating the emotional toll these events have taken
on my personal and professional life. This claim, totalling £120,000, is a reflection of the
substantial losses | have endured and is supported by the evidence and circumstances
detailed herein.

subsequent treatment.

£5,000 is made for this loss.
