1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,500
 [silence]

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
 Hello, good morning, Zorin. Good morning.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
 How are you?

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 Ah, like an old man, you know.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
 Sleepy.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 Yeah, well, it's worse than that, you know.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 I think I'm really suffering from old age, you know.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 I think it is a bad time.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 Maybe I'm gonna talk to our managers and retire soon.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 [laughs]

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 That would be nice, wouldn't it?

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 Absolutely, yeah.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 You can't be that old, be yourself though.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 Well, believe me, most people don't believe how old I am.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 Really?

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 Yeah, yeah. How old do you think I am? Really?

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Um, I don't know.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 Maybe like 40 something.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Right.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 Okay, so just say a number. Just say a number.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 No, I don't know.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 But I know in the UK it is a very sensitive subject,

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 but honestly, I'm very open-minded.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 Just say a number, honestly.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 Okay, I'll go middle range. I'll go 46.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
 Ah, no, I'm not 46. I'm 42.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 [laughs]

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
 But this is really old, you know. This is really old.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 Back in the days, people used to retire at that age.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 Oh yeah, like eight years.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
 Back in the old days.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 [laughs]

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 For sure that's not that old.

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 Yeah, but it's not that young too.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 [laughs]

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
 And I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it.

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Just the way you were talking there,

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 what you were going to be, you know, older.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 Yeah, but honestly,

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
 well, it's only when I start to talk about old age

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 that people start to ask themselves questions.

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 But frankly, you know, last time when we went to the office,

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 and that was my first time, someone asked me the question,

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 and they told me, "You look like 34, 35."

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 I said, "Oh Jesus, thank you very much.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 I am not 35."

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 He said, "You can't be older than that."

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 I said, "I am much older than that."

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 He said, "Prove it." So I gave him my driving license.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 So really, that must be fake. I say it's not fake, it's real.

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 [laughs]

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 To be fair, I wasn't even really guessing on the way you actually look.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 I was just guessing because I know you've got like children,

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 so I was like, "Well, I can't be that young."

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 Well, some people, you wouldn't believe it,

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 but I sort of became grandfather, you know.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Okay, let me tell you how.

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 So my cousin, like my direct cousin,

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 the daughter of my father's sister,

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 literally, my cousin,

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 unfortunately, she passed away in 1991,

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 and back in the day, she had one daughter,

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 so we started to take care of her.

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 So she calls that because of the African culture,

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 she calls us dad, and me and my brother, she calls that dad.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 Now, she's got kids, and guess how the kids are calling us?

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 [laughs]

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 You see, granddad indeed.

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 So I became a grandfather without even realizing it.

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 [laughs]

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Quite a young granddad.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 Yeah, yeah, quite young.

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 So every time I see them when they call me granddad,

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 people are like, "What is going on here?"

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 That can't be real.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 Yeah, exactly.

77
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 They say, "What is going on here?

78
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 Was it 10 or something?"

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 Like, "No, what is going on?"

80
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 [laughs]

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 It's very young.

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
 And Zoe, before we start, I have one question.

83
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 How do you manage to...

84
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 It sounds like a stupid question,

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 but how do you manage to remain so calm?

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 [laughs]

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 No, really, because there are a few things I find disturbingly annoying.

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 Honestly.

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 And I'm wondering how you manage to remain so calm.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 Do you have special techniques or a special short of breath

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 that helps you?

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 [laughs]

93
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 You know what, I just put myself on mute

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 and then you can just say what you want, really.

95
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 Ah, that's your question.

96
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 I just do it out as well a lot of the time.

97
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 I can't handle a lot of it.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 Wow, wow, wow.

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 Because I don't know how...

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 Okay, okay, so I'll follow your lead on that,

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 because sometimes I don't know.

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 I'm going to be very honest with you.

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 Sometimes I don't know.

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 I really don't get...

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 Sorry, but I know Jason is facing some challenges,

106
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 but the way he talks, including to our manager and so on,

107
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 I'm wondering how...

108
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 Sometimes I'm asking myself questions.

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 How do you manage to be so calm?

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 Like, this is amazing.

111
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 Honestly, like, wow.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 Yeah, like...

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 He is actually all right.

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 I do agree, like, he doesn't talk very well,

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 but see, if I raise the point and have something to say,

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 he is quite nice to me.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 [sighs]

118
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
 So I find it difficult, because...

119
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 Like, yeah, he just goes...

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 He rants and rants and rants and rants and rants.

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 Only time, Jesus.

122
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 But, you know, he'll go through a phase,

123
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 and like, next week, he'll, like, not talk at all.

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 So, and then you'll be...

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 You'll have a nice few weeks,

126
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 and then you'll forget about all the crappy bits.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 He just goes through a lot of phases.

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 But yeah, because I find it, like,

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 it's kind of different for you.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Well, not just now, but because, especially him and Greg,

132
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 like, they're doing a lot of the on-prem,

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 like, work, and I'm really not involved in it.

134
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 So as soon as they start to talk about that,

135
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 I just literally don't even really pay attention.

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 You might not be quite in such a position

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 where you can just ignore all what they say about that stuff.

138
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 So that does make it easier for me.

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 Honestly, you know, I think...

141
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 [sighs]

142
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 Well, okay, okay, I think I'll take your advice there,

143
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 you know, whenever this is happening,

144
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 I'll just have some short read and hope for the next week

145
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 to be better.

146
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 What can you do?

147
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 I don't know, like, it clear, it's quite good

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 at sticking out for her as well, so...

149
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 No!

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 Sometimes she'll just take it,

151
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 and then sometimes she will pick her battles.

152
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 I think she does know.

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 Yeah, no, even Claire, I don't know.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 Honestly, like, quite frankly,

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 I've been with you for, what, like,

156
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 a little bit over a month now.

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 Honestly, I'm not saying that to be polite,

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 but I'm just saying what I think here.

159
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 I think Claire, honestly, she's...

160
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 I don't know who her husband or partner is,

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 but he's very lucky, you know,

162
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 because the way she's able to remain calm,

163
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 you know, despite the sometimes tone of voice

164
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
 I find completely inappropriate and things like that,

165
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 I do have a lot of admiration for this woman.

166
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 Honestly, like, some days, when she will expect the list,

167
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 I'm gonna also ask her the question,

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 "Claire, what is your secret?

169
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 What sort of short breath are you having?

170
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 There is a thing you do."

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 You need to tell me, there must be a secret.

172
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 No, really, it's unbelievable.

173
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 I mean, for me, it's a lesson of...

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 in self-control.

175
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 Not that I lack in the self-control,

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
 but, you know, I've encountered very few people

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 able to remain calm under such circumstances.

178
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 Like, no, this is most unusual.

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 I think she deserved the Nobel Prize for Peace or something.

180
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 The Pro-Pace Keeping.

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 Yeah, and I think as well, like,

182
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 just when I started, there were a few other members of the team,

183
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 and I think they were all really quite difficult.

184
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 And I think Jason's, like, the only one left from that team,

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 so I think it actually used to be, like, a lot worse.

186
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Oh, Jesus, really? What is that?

187
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 I don't know, it was just, like, a lot of strong opinions,

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 and people, like, when you did a bit of work,

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 people would, like, disagree a lot with the way you did it,

190
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 and there would be, like, a lot of debate

191
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 and a lot of chat about certain things.

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 But even, well, you know, having strong opinions

193
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 is not a problem, you know,

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 but they need to be backed by facts.

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 Like, you know, when I see him, like, downplaying the work,

196
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 the security teams and so on are doing,

197
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 I mean, this is not right, like, you know,

198
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 I mean, these people, they're doing what they can

199
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 at the end of the day, and they most likely have, you know,

200
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 some policies they have to stick to.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 You see what I mean, like, in the book?

202
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 Yeah, security are rubbish, though.

203
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 Like, I do agree, like, the way he talks about them

204
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 isn't very nice, but they are very good.

205
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Yeah.

206
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 And if you want to get to work with them,

207
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 if that ever happens, you will quite see.

208
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 Like, I do agree, like, they do have a job to do,

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 and obviously they've got their own stuff going on.

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 It's difficult for them, especially right now.

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 But, like, before when I worked with, like, one guy,

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 I would have, like, a meeting every two weeks or something like that,

213
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 and I pretty much, it was the same meeting every two weeks,

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 and I would tell them exact same things,

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 and he still, like, wouldn't understand what was going on.

216
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 I... well, these are most likely information security people.

217
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 Yeah.

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 It is difficult, but, like, again,

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 I don't deal with them that much anymore,

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 or something like that, but he just likes to go on a rant

221
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 about things like that.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 This security thing is probably the biggest one, so...

223
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 Okay.

224
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 We'll get him some vodka or some whiskey.

225
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 He's gonna cool him down.

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 He doesn't drink, but yeah.

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 We'll find some tricks to get him to drink.

228
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 He'll become happy again.

229
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 Okay.

230
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 So, Zoe, yeah, so, as you were mentioning yesterday,

231
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 you spoke about an account that was used,

232
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 that was used, or that is used for the...

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 TerraFar automation on AWS.

234
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 And yesterday, when you were talking,

235
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 I think you went on to a repository

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 where there was a piece of code that was run by that user.

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 Am I correct?

238
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 Yeah, I'm sure.

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 Like, I can't remember...

240
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 Did we go over, like, the pipelines with you before?

241
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 We went briefly over the Azure DevOps pipeline.

242
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 Yeah.

243
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 Yeah, so, like, I can show you, like, so...

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 Just now we have, like, this pipeline, for example,

245
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 which is just an elastic search to me.

246
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 Like, it's just an AWS.

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 There's not a big, like, resource or anything like that.

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 But this works in Azure DevOps.

249
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 So, it must...

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 Where's the pipeline?

251
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 Yeah.

252
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 Like, it is, like, it can see that there's been changes

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 being made and stuff, so I'm pretty sure it works like as in...

254
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 I'm sure I've added at least IPs

255
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 and removed them for whatever reason, like, changed them.

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 So, yeah.

257
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 Like, are you...

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 Have you created, like, a branch or anything yet?

259
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 No, no, no, no. I mean, on the AWS side,

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 all I've done, all I did first of all was

261
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 trying to find any, you know,

262
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 users with the right privileges,

263
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 able to run some Terraform scripts.

264
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 I did find two with Terraform in them,

265
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 but they hadn't...

266
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 The...

267
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 Both hadn't been used in, like, a couple of years.

268
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 So, this is why I thought to myself,

269
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 maybe it is better to, you know, to set up a new one.

270
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 So, I created a new user with the name TerraformUser

271
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 with the right privileges in order to use that to, you know,

272
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 to design all the Terraform script for all the elements

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
 we have on AWS at the moment.

274
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 And once tested and once I know it is,

275
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 at a minimum acceptable, I'll start to check them

276
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 to check them into the GitHub repository.

277
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 This is the plan ahead, really.

278
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 So, we do have this service account.

279
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 This is the old one.

280
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 So, I think that's the user that should have been used.

281
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 So, SCArk/Obs.

282
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 Okay, okay.

283
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 Okay, so, let me see.

284
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 If I can see that user there.

285
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 One second.

286
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 Sorry, my laptop is a little bit slow,

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 but it's going to start actually, so I'll have to update it.

288
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 Okay, where is the signing?

289
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 One second, I'm trying to, yeah, sign.

290
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 No, what is that?

291
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 Okay, I am using it.

292
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 Just putting my ID.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 Next.

294
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 Alright, so make.

295
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 And press right.

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 So, just key in the password and it will be the,

297
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 the, yeah.

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 So, it is going to be 664, that sounds like a lot of things.

299
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 Okay.

300
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 So, when I go into IMUsers.

301
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 So, it's SC.Ark.

302
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 Okay.

303
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 So, SC.

304
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 Yeah, I can, let me share my screen and show you that user.

305
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 So, you should be able to see my screen now.

306
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 So, yeah, I got that user.

307
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 Okay, okay, this one here.

308
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 Yeah.

309
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 Because it is disabled console access.

310
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 Yeah, so, like, it has actually, like, it's been disabled.

311
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 We can't use it, but that was the account that was being used.

312
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 Yeah, and it doesn't have that.

313
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 So, I don't know what to do, to do the, should we, I don't know.

314
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 Take the.

315
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 Like, I think it would be fine just to use it again, but, so,

316
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 it might be better to, like, you move it to this new user that we have,

317
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 which is basically the same user with just the cloud version of the account.

318
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 Just to keep it consistent with everything else.

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 Because these accounts are being used to, like, run all our pipelines

320
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 and everything like that anyway.

321
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 So, great way to make sense to add it.

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 So, okay, so, in this case then, as these, I think this user is,

323
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 but it was used yesterday.

324
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 Yes, that's what I mean.

325
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 The pipelines probably run still, so.

326
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 Okay, so.

327
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 Because it's like an AD group, I guess, like, it doesn't care that what AD says about it,

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 but an AD is gone.

329
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 Okay, so, I'm not sure what to do here.

330
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 So, should I just try to change the policy for that very specific account?

331
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 I'll send you the name of this new user, right?

332
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 And if you want to create, like, the same account, or, like, the same permissions with an account with that name or whatever.

333
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 Okay.

334
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Okay, I'll try to see if I can.

335
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 No, no, I don't think I'll be able to create another account with the same name

336
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 because I think the system will most likely refuse it because this one is already.

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 It's not the same name, it does have AC1 at the start.

338
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 Is there any somewhere though?

339
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

340
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 There is a one here, yeah.

341
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 Yeah, AC1.

342
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 Okay, okay, so let's do that then.

343
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 So, I'm gonna forget about the, I'll try to disable the account I created yesterday,

344
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 and I'm gonna create a new one with the right privileges and with that name.

345
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 And then if you add it, once you create, like, an access key, you can add it to Key Vault,

346
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 but maybe it would be better if we can just chat through that bit after you've done that if you want.

347
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 Okay, no problem, no problem, no problem, let's do that.

348
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 I'm gonna do that way, okay.

349
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 Okay, so, okay, so thank you very much for your time today.

350
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 No worries.

351
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 Enjoy your first day.

352
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 The day where we first did, so we're having beer and whiskey.

353
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 I had a few beers last night, so I've got to...

354
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 Ah, excellent, excellent, well done.

355
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 I had just some water yesterday, Jesus, like that.

356
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 Okay, so...

357
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 Sometimes you need a drink coming out of that call.

358
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 Sorry?

359
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 Sometimes you need a drink coming out of that call.

360
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 Yeah, okay, okay.

362
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 Yeah, you will be fine.

363
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 Okay, so thank you very much.

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 You're welcome.

365
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 So thank you very much for your time today, and are you gonna be coming to the office on the 12th?

366
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 Okay, okay.

368
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 So, do you think Claire will...

369
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 Do you think we can force Claire to go to the pub instead of the restaurant on the first day,

370
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 and I don't think it's appropriate for a new employee?

371
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 The only problem with going to the pub is there's no pubs around the office.

372
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 Ah, yeah, it's true.

373
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 It's true that it's only garages and...

374
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Yeah, it's more difficult.

375
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 But we should arrange to go to the pub sometime.

376
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 Absolutely, absolutely. Ah, some whiskey at last.

377
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 We're running out of whiskey in sterling, you know.

378
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 Oh, really?

379
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 I finished all of it, yeah.

381
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Stop by.

382
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 So let me know once you clear that up, Claire,

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 and we can go through the pain-tied part if you want.

384
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 Okay, no problem, no problem.

385
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 I'll do so.

386
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 It's not gonna take me long.

387
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 Just a few minutes, okay.

388
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 Okay, okay, sorry, thank you.

389
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Bye-bye.

390
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 Bye.
