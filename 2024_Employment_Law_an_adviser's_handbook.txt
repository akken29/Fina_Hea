Preface

This book was first written because Thomas Kibling and I were constantly
asked to recommend a book which covered the wide range of employment
problems in a clear and practical form. There was no obvious book to
recommend and we wrote this book to fill the gap. In particular, we have
aimed to provide lay advisers, trade union officials and lawyers with a
handbook which is a real support in identifying the relevant law and issues of
evidence and which can be used as a self-contained guide while running
unfair dismissal and discrimination cases. The book therefore devotes as
much space to evidence, precedents and checklists as to setting out the law.
Due to this practical emphasis, further research may be necessary on the law
itself in new, developing, specialist or complex areas.
For a clear overview of the contents and layout of the book, it is best to
look at the contents list on pages xi–xvi. Employment law is a large subject,
which has simply exploded in recent years, especially as a result of
European influence. The book now is almost twice as long as the first
edition. It is not possible to cover the whole of employment law and all the
rules and permutations in a small textbook. Inevitably there are some
omissions and certain topics have been covered in more detail than others. I
have tried to deal most thoroughly with subjects which frequently come up
for advisers of low-paid workers. Because of its complexity, discrimination
law has been treated in the greatest detail. At certain points in the book, I
express views on points of law which are untested or could be challenged. I
am happy to hear other arguments and I may be proved wrong – it’s important
always to keep an open mind.
Since 2010, the government has systematically cut back on employment
rights, as well as making radical changes to the tribunal system by removing

non-legal members from unfair dismissal claims, introducing pre-claim
conciliation and most devastatingly, charging fees. In July 2017, the Supreme
Court declared the fees order unlawful under both domestic and EU law
because it had the effect of preventing access to justice.
A continuing area of uncertainty is the long-term effect of Britain leaving
the European Union. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 effectively
converts EU law as it stands immediately before exit into UK law. However,
in future such rights will be subject to political change by any majority party
in parliament without the bulwark of Europe as a safeguard.
Meanwhile in the UK, the issue of basic employment rights (minimum
pay and holidays) for workers in the so-called gig economy continues to
attract a great deal of media attention, with test cases regarding the
employment status of Uber taxi drivers, couriers and others. Increasing
numbers working on zero-hours contracts are also a particularly vulnerable
group. Some employment rights are available only to employees working
under a contract of employment, others are available to workers generally. In
early editions, we used the generic word ‘worker’. Since the fifth edition, I
have tried to use the appropriate terminology when dealing with each right.
However, this can become awkward in some contexts, and it is most
important to check the start of each section to see who is covered. Unless
specified, where the word ‘worker’ is used, it is not confined to the
definition of ‘worker’ followed in certain legislation.
The internet is now an invaluable access source for reports, guidance and
Codes. As these are often badly sign-posted and hard to find on the host
websites, I have tried to give the exact web addresses. Unfortunately these
tend to be long and cumbersome and very frequently change. If you find they
are out of date, try looking through the sitemap. The internal search engines
rarely help, but it sometimes works if you type in the full name of a report.
Surprisingly often, the best bet is to type the name of what you want into
Google. A fair amount of information is available on the GOV.UK site,
although in a simplified form.
Regarding cases and statutory references in the footnotes, ‘SI’ stands for
‘statutory instrument’ and can be accessed on the Legislation.gov.uk UK
website. Cases with the ‘UKEAT’ reference can be found on GOV.UK, EAT
section. ‘IRLR’ refers to Industrial Relations Law Reports. Most cases at
all levels can be found on Bailii, but I only give the Bailii citation where the

case is not reported in IRLR or on the EAT’s own website. Web addresses
for all these are in appendix F.
I should say that all the names used in the case precedents in the
appendices are fictional and any resemblance to real names is purely
coincidental.
The law is stated as known at 1 October 2021. Where possible, reference
has been made to more recent law at proof stage.

Acknowledgements

The development of Central London Law Centre’s employment unit was
greatly assisted by a small group of volunteers who showed remarkable
commitment over the years. Particular thanks to barristers Nick O’Brien and
Martin Westgate for being such staunch supporters of the law centre for a
very long time. Sadly the Law Centre eventually became a victim to funding
cuts and closed. Thanks also to Thomas Kibling, my first inspiration in
employment law, who conceived the idea of this book with me many years
ago.
In relation to this book, many thanks to Martin Westgate, Dave Jones and
particularly Philip Tsamados for checking various sections over past editions
and helping with tricky queries. Thanks also to Vivienne Gay for her
invaluable inputs into the equal pay chapter. Any mistakes are nevertheless
my own.
Finally I would like to thank all at LAG for their encouragement and
support over the years. In particular, my editor, Esther Pilger, who shows
remarkable patience and good humour at all points.

Chapter 1: Key points
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

All employees have a contract of employment. Verbal
contracts have the same status as written contracts, but are
harder to prove.
Contract terms may be express, implied or inserted by statute.
Express terms are written or verbally agreed. Where there is
no express term, an implied term may fill the gap. Terms may
be implied because they are obvious or by looking at what has
happened in practice, but not just because they are
reasonable.
Also, general implied terms apply in most employment
contracts, eg the obligation not to destroy trust and
confidence.
Under Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s1, certain contract
terms must be put in writing. A written statement of these
particulars does not necessarily constitute the contract in itself,
but often amounts to strong evidence of what the contract is.
Changes in terms should be confirmed in a section 4
statement.
Contract terms are often varied during employment, but this
can only occur by agreement (express or implied). Where the
employer tries to enforce changes to the contract without
agreement, this is called ‘unilateral variation’.
An employee must respond quickly where the employer tries
to impose contract changes unilaterally, otherwise s/he may be
taken to have agreed the change by inaction. There are
various options for an employee in this situation, but most of
them risk dismissal. If an employee is dismissed for refusing to
accept a contract change, the dismissal will not necessarily be
unfair.
There are special regulations protecting employees working on
fixed-term contracts from unjustified less favourable treatment.

•

•

•

•

•

Temporary agency workers must be given equal access to
facilities and knowledge of permanent vacancies; after 12
weeks, they must be given the same basic working conditions
as if they were a permanent employee or worker.
In theory, an employer can be sued for defamation, malicious
falsehood or negligent misstatement if s/he writes a misleading
or inaccurate reference. In practice, these claims are difficult
to bring.
Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
the Data Protection Act 2018, workers have access to their
own personal data and can seek corrections of inaccurate
information held on them.
Monitoring and privacy at work are covered by various
specialist legislation as well as the Human Rights Act 1998 and
Part 3 of the Data Protection Code, subject to updating by the
GDPR.
The Freedom of Information Act 2000 provides access to
information held by public authorities.

General guide to useful evidence
•

•

•

The letter of appointment; written contract of employment or
statement of particulars under ERA 1996 s1; the staff
handbook; any collective agreement (if unionised) or other
written procedures; payslips.
If there is no written contract: the job advertisement; what was
said at interview and immediately on starting; custom and
practice at the workplace.
Having established the original contractual agreement, look for
any variations which were applicable at the material time:
further documents; verbal agreements; changes in practice.

The contract of employment
Overview

1.1

Depending on the circumstances, people may work on a variety of
arrangements, eg as self-employed, as a ‘worker’ or as an
‘employee’. As will be clarified throughout this book, their status
will affect the extent of their employment rights. Whatever the basis
for their employment, they are likely to be working under some kind
of contract. Paras 1.1–1.40 of this chapter specifically concern the
contractual rights of employees. For the definition of an employee in
the context of unfair dismissal law, see paras 6.4–6.12. Every
employee has a contract of employment, which consists of a number
of terms, some of which are express terms, some implied and some
statutory. Express terms are those agreed between the employer and
employee whether in writing or orally. Implied terms are not
expressly agreed but are implied from surrounding circumstances
into the contract of employment by the tribunals and courts. Some
implied terms are universal (ie they apply to all contracts of
employment) and others are implied as a natural consequence of a
specific contract of employment, either because the term is so
obvious that the employer and employee would have agreed to the
term if asked to consider it, or because the contract could not work
without the term being incorporated. Statutory terms are inserted into
the contract by Acts of Parliament. For example, the ‘Equality of
Terms’ section of the Equality Act (EqA) 2010 inserts an equality
clause into contracts.

Express terms
1.2

An express term is one which has been the subject of discussion and
acceptance by the employer and employee. These terms are usually
put in writing, but this is not necessary.1 The main express terms are
usually found in the letter of appointment or in the written contract of
employment. Sometimes they are found in other documents such as
the staff handbook, the rule book or collective agreement. Also
watch for memos, notices on a notice board, emails and policies on
the intranet, although these documents may or may not have
contractual status. Payslips can provide good evidence of contractual
pay rates and the name of the employer, although they are unlikely to

amount to contractual documents in themselves. It would not be
unusual for a redundancy policy containing enhanced redundancy
terms to be in an employee handbook rather than in the main contract
document.2 Even where a handbook or intranet policy or similar is
expressly incorporated into the contract of employment, not every
clause within it will necessarily be regarded as contractual. For
example, clauses which set out policy or good practice guidelines or
minute details of sickness absence procedures might not be suitable
(‘apt’) for incorporation as part of a contract.3 The main express
terms are usually:
•

the rate of pay, and how often the employee will be paid;

•

the hours of work;

•

any terms and conditions relating to holidays and holiday pay;

•

sick pay;

•

notice pay; and

•

the disciplinary rules and grievance procedure.

Implied terms
In the absence of express terms, employment contracts need terms to
be implied into them in order to make them workable, meaningful
and complete. Implied terms of fact are used to fill a gap where there
is no express term on a particular point. The courts will imply a term
only if it is absolutely necessary to do so, or if it is clear that the
employer and employee would have agreed to the term if it had been
discussed.4 The courts will not intervene and imply a term just
because it is reasonable or convenient.5 The idea is to give effect to
the parties’ presumed intentions. There are four common ways of
trying to work out what an implied term might be:

1.3

•

the ‘business efficacy’ test;

•

the ‘officious bystander’ test;

•

the behaviour of the parties in practice; and

•

custom and practice.

1.4

1.5

1.6

The ‘business efficacy’ test is where a term is implied to make the
contract workable. For example, it is likely to be an implied contract
term that a chauffeur holds a valid driving licence, even though this
has never been explicitly discussed. The ‘officious bystander’ test is
where a term is so obvious that both parties would instantly have
agreed it at the outset, had they been asked. This test works for the
driving licence example too. However, these tests do not always
give an answer where there is no express term on a point.
A term can sometimes be implied by looking at what has happened
between the particular employee and the employer in practice. This
may be called implication by ‘past performance’ or by ‘custom and
practice’. For example, if the employer has given seven weeks’
holiday every year to the employee without exception this may
indicate an unspoken agreement at the outset for seven weeks’
holiday. This way of implying a contractual term can be confusing,
because behaviour and the contractual position can change over time.
As well as what has happened with the individual employee,
custom and practice across the workplace or the industry may also
give rise to an implied term if the custom and practice is reasonable,
notorious and certain. ‘Reasonable’ means that the term is fair,
‘notorious’ requires the term to be well known, and ‘certain’
requires the term to be sufficiently precise so that the term is
possible to state.6 For example, the employer always closes the
factory for a trade holiday and gives all staff paid holidays for that
week.7 Depending on the facts, a policy which is adopted
unilaterally by management, eg to pay travel expenses or to give
enhanced redundancy pay, can sometimes become implied into an
employee’s contract by custom and practice.8

Universal implied terms
Mutual trust and confidence
1.7

As employment contracts involve personal contact between the
parties, it is necessary to have certain terms implied into them so that
they can operate smoothly, such as the implied term of mutual trust

and confidence. This is the most widely applied and influential of all
the implied terms. The employer must not, without reasonable and
proper cause, conduct him/herself in a manner calculated or likely to
destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence
with the employee.9 This term applies to the employee as well. The
following are examples of breaches of this implied term by the
employer:
•

physical or verbal abuse;10

•

sexual harassment11 and the failure to support someone who has been the victim of
harassment at work;12

•

imposing a disciplinary penalty when unwarranted or where the disciplinary procedure is
not followed.13

1.8

Breach of the implied term of trust and confidence may cause an
employee to resign and claim constructive dismissal.14
In very limited circumstances, employers may use an express term
in a way which breaches the implied term of trust and confidence.
For example, in one case the employers were in breach of this term
when they invoked a mobility clause to insist an employee move
workplace to a distant town on extremely short notice.15 Usually,
however, employers are able to rely on express terms, however
unreasonable the result.
Not to act arbitrarily, capriciously or inequitably

1.9

There is an implied term that an employer will not treat an employee
arbitrarily, capriciously or inequitably without good reason. Failing
to give an employee a pay increase without good cause when other
employees are given an increase has been held to be a breach of this
term.16
Good faith and fidelity

1.10

This implied term lasts during employment but not after its
termination.17 Any action by an employee which seriously harms the
employer’s business will be in breach of this term18 (although
whistleblowing authorised by the Public Interest Disclosure Act

1998 would override this).19 Likewise, an employer who discloses
to a third party information about an employee without good reason
or consent will be in breach of this term. Examples are:

1.11

•

carrying on business in competition with the employer;20

•

the use of the employer’s list of customers including his/her business requirements.21

Employees cannot use confidential information for their own
personal benefit during their employment.
The employee may also have agreed express contract terms, eg not
to set up in competition after leaving the employment or not to poach
staff or customers for a specified period of time. These are known as
‘restrictive covenants’. If they are too restrictive in their ambit, they
may not be enforceable, because it can be against the public interest
to restrain trade more than is reasonably required to protect
legitimate business interests. This is a complex area of law.
Not to disclose trade secrets/confidentiality

1.12

It is implied that the employee cannot disclose, either during
employment or after it has ended, the employer’s trade secrets or
highly confidential information.22 Most employees will not have
access to information which would amount to a trade secret. The true
nature of a trade secret is something which the outside world does
not or could not ascertain, such as a process or a chemical formula,
eg the ingredients of Coca Cola, and not just lower level confidential
information which the employer does not want the employee to use
after s/he leaves.23
To obey reasonable and lawful orders

1.13

The employee is obliged to obey reasonable and lawful orders.
Lawful means both a requirement of parliament as well as an order
given within the ambit of the employment contract. If the employee is
asked to perform a function outside the employment contract which is
unreasonable, s/he can, in theory, refuse. The employee needs to be
careful because a small degree of flexibility is often taken to be
within the contract. Also, if the employee is dismissed for failing to

follow a reasonable but non-contractual order, it is still possible that
the dismissal will be fair.24
Care of employer’s equipment
1.14

The employee owes the employer a duty to look after the employer’s
equipment and machinery. The failure to exercise due care, leading
to loss to the employer, could constitute a disciplinary matter. This
will arise if the employee has injured a third party, as any claim by
the latter will usually be against the employer.
To employ a competent workforce

1.15

The employer owes a duty to employ a competent and safe
workforce,25 safe plant and equipment, to have a safety system at
work and to pay attention to employees’ complaints in relation to
safety matters.26
To provide a safe working environment

1.16

The employer owes a contractual duty to provide a safe working
environment. (There are also detailed statutory rules about health and
safety at work.)27
To deal promptly with grievances

1.17

The employer is under a duty to give employees an opportunity to
have their grievances heard reasonably and promptly.28

Statutory terms
1.18

Due to the unequal bargaining power between workers and
employers, successive governments have found it necessary to
incorporate into the employment contract certain terms protecting
workers during, and on termination of, employment, for example
minimum notice pay, an equality clause under the EqA 2010
(previously the Equal Pay Act 1970) and the national minimum
wage.

1.19

Generally speaking, clauses which exclude an employee’s various
statutory rights are void, though there are special rules when claims
are settled and in respect of employee shareholders.29

Varying the terms of employment
1.20

1.21

1.22

Any term of the employment contract can be varied by consent of the
parties (except for certain statutory minimum terms). If the employer
tries to vary a term of the employment contract but does not get the
employee’s consent, that variation is not recognised as lawful.30
However, the courts and tribunals may treat the employee as having
consented to the variation if s/he does not object to the change within
a reasonable period of time. It is therefore important that the
employee objects to any proposed variation as soon as possible. It is
not necessary for the employee to keep repeating his/her objection –
once is sufficient if it is clear and unequivocal. However, an
objection cannot hold all the options open forever without taking
further action.31
Where an employer insists on varying terms without the
employee’s consent, the employee’s refusal to agree will rarely be
the end of the matter. The employer may impose the changes anyway,
such that the employee’s normal options are to resist, resign32 or, if
relevant, sue for any unauthorised deduction from wages or breach of
contract. Alternatively, if the change is very radical, an employee
may claim that s/he has in reality been dismissed and is now working
under an alternative contract.33 The employee can then claim unfair
dismissal, while still working in the new employment. There are
other options too, eg claiming discrimination, whether or not the
employee actually leaves the employment. A checklist of the options
is in appendix A.34
Many of the options may lead to the employee’s dismissal.
Whether or not an employee will succeed in an unfair dismissal case
depends on eligibility to claim and the normal principles of
fairness.35 It does not necessarily follow that dismissal for opposing
a change of contract will be unfair. Even if it is, the employee may
not get much by way of compensation. In some circumstances, the

dismissal will be automatically unfair, eg if on the facts it is due to
the employee having asserted a statutory right such as to have written
particulars of the terms and conditions of employment or not to have
an unauthorised deduction from wages.36
The employer cannot effect a change in the contract simply by
notifying the employee that after a period of time the contract will be
treated as having been varied. Employers have been known to
terminate the original employment contract and offer a new contract
which contains the variation as a means of getting round the
employee’s lack of consent to the variation. This approach is only
lawful under the contract if the full contractual period of notice is
given to terminate the employment contract and it is clear that the
original contract is being terminated. If this happens, the employee
may be able to claim unfair dismissal in respect of the first contract
and continue to work under the second contract on the new terms.
What s/he cannot do is claim unfair dismissal, accept the new
contract so that s/he can continue working, and then say that the new
terms which s/he has accepted do not in fact bind him/her. Where the
employer carries out mass dismissals in this way, the duty to consult
trade union or employee representatives regarding collective
redundancies also applies.37

1.23

The right to written particulars of employment
Workers are entitled to receive at the start of their employment,38 a
written statement of particulars of their employment. This is often
known as a ‘section 1 statement’.39 The particulars must include:

1.24

•

the names of the employer and worker;

•

the date on which employment began, including any period of continuous employment with
a previous employer;

•

rates of pay or methods of calculating pay and frequency of payment;

•

hours of work, including normal working hours, compulsory overtime,40 the days of the
week the worker is required to work and, if such hours or days may vary, how that
variation will be decided;

•

terms relating to holidays, including public holidays, holiday pay and how it will be
calculated when the worker leaves the job;

•

the worker’s job title or a brief description of the work for which s/he is employed;

•

place of work, including details of any mobility clause, and the employer’s address;

•

rules relating to sickness or injury, sick pay and details of any other paid leave;

•

pension arrangements;

•

any other benefits provided by the employer;

•

the length of notice required by each party;

•

if employment is not intended to be permanent, the period for which it is expected to
continue, or if a fixed-term contract, its expiry date;

•

any probationary period, including its conditions and duration;

•

any training entitlement, identifying if it is compulsory and where the employer will not pay
the cost of the training;

•

any collective agreements which directly affect the terms and conditions of employment;

•

certain details41 if the employee is required to work outside the UK for a period of more
than one month;

•

the disciplinary rules and procedure;42

•

the name of a person to whom the employee can apply if s/he is dissatisfied with any
disciplinary decision or seeking redress of any grievance relating to his/her employment;
and

•

1.25

any other term which, in view of its importance, is an essential part of the contract.43

Where there are no particulars on a point, this should be stated. If
there is a change in any of the terms, the employer is required to
notify the worker in writing within one month of the change.44 This is
sometimes called a ‘section 4 statement’. Employers do not always
make this written notification of contract variations, but an agreed
variation will nevertheless be valid (provided it can be proved).
For terms related to disciplinary and grievance procedure,
sickness, other paid leave, pension and training, the section 1
statement can refer to another reasonably accessible document.
Regarding notice, the statement can refer to the legal position (see
para 1.38) or a reasonably accessible collective agreement. The
terms related to pensions, training, applicable collective agreements,
and the note on disciplinary and grievance procedures can be
provided in instalments within two months of the worker starting the

1.26

1.27

1.28

job. Where an employer has supplied a written contract of
employment or letter of engagement containing all the required
particulars within the relevant time, this will be sufficient.45
The statement of terms is not itself the contract. It is strong but not
conclusive evidence of what the contractual terms are.46 If no proper
statement is supplied as required, the worker can apply to an
employment tribunal (ET) during employment or within three months
after termination of employment.47 The application can ask the ET to
decide all the particulars which ought to have been given in a
statement, or simply one or two specific particulars which have been
omitted. The ET cannot award compensation in itself for failure to
supply the particulars, but it can award two or four weeks’ gross pay
(subject to the same cap as for statutory redundancy pay) as extra
compensation where the worker has also brought and won certain
other claims, eg unfair dismissal (if an employee) or
discrimination.48 Unless there are exceptional circumstances, this
award must be made if, at the time such proceedings were started,
the employer was in breach of his/her duty to supply a section 1 or
section 4 statement.49
In practice, workers tend not to apply to the ET unless there is a
dispute over their entitlement, eg to holidays. There is always a risk
that the worker will not be happy with the ET’s findings on what the
true contractual position is. It is is automatically unfair to dismiss an
employee, regardless of length of service, because s/he has asked for
a section 1 statement.50
The duty on the ET is to decide what has in fact been agreed by the
employer and the worker (including any term which needs to be
implied), but not to remake a contract or decide what should have
been agreed. The ET cannot go as far as interpreting what an agreed
contractual term actually means – for that it is necessary to get a
declaration in a civil court.51 The ET may have to make findings as
to the terms and conditions of the contract when initially made and
then consider whether there have been subsequent variations.

Wrongful dismissal

Overview
1.29

1.30

1.31

1.32

Unlike unfair dismissal, which is a statutory right, wrongful
dismissal is a contractual claim. It arises when an employer
terminates the employment contract contrary to the terms of the
contract (eg failure to give proper notice, or breach of another
contractual term such as failure to follow the contractual disciplinary
procedure).
The general rule is that either party can end the contract by giving
the appropriate notice and without cause or reason. Where an
employee has committed an act of gross misconduct, the employer
may end the contract without giving notice. What amounts to gross
misconduct depends on the facts of each case, but essentially it is
deliberate or grossly negligent conduct which would completely
undermine the employer’s trust and confidence in the employment
contract.52 Some employment contracts define what amounts to gross
misconduct; some acts such as theft and physical assault are obvious
acts of gross misconduct and do not need stating. Although gross
misconduct entitles the employer to dismiss without giving notice,
whether the dismissal is fair is a separate question under the general
unfair dismissal provisions of the ERA 1996.53
A wrongfully dismissed employee can recover damages for breach
of contract. The idea is to put the employee in the position s/he
would have been in if the employer had not broken the contract.
Where the breach of contract is failure to give proper notice,
compensation will usually be the net loss of earnings (pay and other
benefits, eg use of a company car) for the notice period, subject to
mitigation. The employee is expected to take reasonable steps to
reduce his/her loss by seeking alternative employment. Any earnings
received in the notice period will be set off against the claim.54 It is
also possible that any jobseeker’s allowance received will be set off
if it amounted to a net gain; similarly if the employee unreasonably
failed to claim it.55
Employers often give employees notice pay rather than asking
them to work their notice. The contract of employment sometimes has
a ‘PILON’ (pay in lieu of notice) clause which says they can do this.

1.33

1.34

1.35

This is so that technically there is no breach of contract, which might
have other consequences. Either way, if an employer chooses to pay
in lieu, the basic pay will be taxable as earnings.56 Matters of tax are
beyond the scope of this book and where there is an issue, advisers
should check specialist sources.
It is not possible to recover compensation for mental distress or
injury to feelings caused by the wrongful dismissal,57 although it
might be possible to get stigma damages, but this will only arise in
very limited circumstances.58 It may, however, be possible to claim
damages for breach of the implied term of trust and confidence if this
takes place before and is unconnected with the dismissal.59 It may be
difficult to know on the facts whether the breach was part of the
process of dismissal. For example, distress caused by a lengthy
suspension which is followed by a disciplinary process ending with
dismissal, may or may not be connected with the dismissal.60
The law is complicated where the wrongful dismissal is because
the employer fails to follow a contractual disciplinary procedure
prior to dismissal. The employee cannot get general compensation
for the breach of procedure, eg for hurt feelings or the lost chance of
being kept on, but s/he may be able to claim wages for the length of
time it would have taken to go through the compulsory disciplinary
procedure.61
If the employer tells the employee that s/he is dismissed without
giving the contractually required notice (unless it is gross
misconduct) or if the employer fails to follow compulsory
requirements in the contract for terminating employment, the
employee can refuse to accept that the dismissal has taken effect.62
The employee probably cannot stop the employer then following the
contractual rules and carrying out an effective dismissal. However,
the extra time can be important if, for example, the employee needs
to remain employed for a few more weeks to become eligible for a
contractual bonus. A more common scenario is where an employee is
dismissed without his/her contractual notice to avoid him/her
reaching the necessary length of service to claim unfair dismissal.
Unfortunately, it seems that refusing to accept the dismissal and

1.36

1.37

keeping the contract alive will not change the termination date for
unfair dismissal purposes.63 Nor will an employee’s compensation
for breach of contract include compensation for the lost opportunity
of bringing an unfair dismissal claim.64
Claims for breach of contract based on failure to follow
disciplinary procedures are hard to prove and should be approached
with caution. Most disciplinary procedures are not contractual but
offer guidance rather than impose mandatory obligations, and failure
to hold a disciplinary hearing or give a warning prior to dismissal
will not necessarily be a breach of contract.
In England and Wales, an employee who has been wrongfully
dismissed can claim in the ET, county court or High Court, subject to
the value of the claim. The court rules are complex and should be
checked.65 As a rough guide, only high value claims can be started in
the High Court. Most claims are started in the county court. There are
different allocation tracks for both county court and High Court
claims according to the type, value and complexity of the claim. One
of these is the small claims track (previously known as ‘the small
claims court’) which covers most claims for damages up to £10,000
(other than certain housing and personal injury claims). There is a
more limited costs risk on the small claims track if the employee
loses than is the usual position in the civil courts.66 Alternatively,
certain contract claims arising or outstanding on the termination of an
employee’s employment may be brought in an ET, currently for up to
£25,000.67 In Scotland, a notice pay claim can be brought in the
relevant civil court, probably the Sheriff Court. The Sheriff Court
operates a ‘simple procedure’ for claims up to and including
£5,000.68 Alternatively, a claim up to £25,000 can be brought in an
ET.69

Statutory minimum notice
1.38

ERA 1996 s86 sets out minimum notice periods, though the contract
may require more. An employer must give at least:

•

one week’s notice to an employee who has been continuously employed for one month or
more but less than two years;

•

one week’s notice for each whole year of continuous employment for an employee
employed for two years or more, but less than 12 years. For example, an employee
employed for five years 11 months, would be entitled to at least five weeks’ notice of
dismissal;

•

12 weeks’ notice for continuous service of 12 years or more. For example, an employee
employed for 16 years would be entitled to at least 12 weeks’ notice.

1.39

An employee employed for one month or more need give only one
week’s notice when resigning (unless the contract requires longer).
Pay for the statutory notice period should be based on the employee’s
normal wage and not any reduction because s/he was on furlough.70
In some situations, neither contractual nor statutory notice needs to
be given,71 eg an instant or summary dismissal for gross misconduct
or a resignation due to the employer’s fundamental breach of contract
(constructive dismissal).
An employee must be paid for the statutory notice period even if
s/he is off sick and has exhausted his/her normal entitlement to sick
pay; or if s/he is absent due to pregnancy, childbirth, adoption leave,
parental leave or paternity leave.72 Oddly, if the employee has a
contractual entitlement to notice which is at least one week longer
than the statutory minimum, s/he entirely loses the right to statutory
notice pay in these circumstances.73 An employee can claim for
wrongful dismissal, including the failure to give notice in the ET
within three months of the effective date of termination (EDT).

Zero hours contracts
1.40

In recent years there has been a huge increase in what has come to be
known as ‘zero hours contracts’. This is not a technical term, but is
generally used to refer to a contract where no minimum number of
hours is guaranteed. Zero hours contracts are particularly heavily
used in the care and hospitality sectors. There has been considerable
public and political discussion about how to improve the rights of
those working on zero hours contracts and this is likely to remain on

the agenda. Since 26 May 2015, ‘exclusivity clauses’ in zero hours
contracts have been unenforceable. An exclusivity clause is one
which prohibits a worker from doing work or performing services
under another contract or arrangement, or which says that the
employer’s consent is required.74 Whether workers on zero hours
contracts are employees and can claim unfair dismissal depends on
the circumstances and is discussed at paras 6.4–6.12.

Fixed-term employees
1.41

1.42

1.43

The Fixed-term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable
Treatment) Regulations (FTE Regs) 200275 implement the EC Fixedterm Work Directive76 and grant additional rights concerning pay and
pensions.
The FTE Regs 2002 only cover employees, but it may be arguable
that the Fixed-term Work Directive also protects other workers.77 A
fixed-term employee is someone who is employed under a contract
of employment that will terminate on a specific date, or on
completion of a particular task, or when a specific event does or
does not happen.78 This can include employees on short contracts to
do seasonal work (eg agricultural workers or working in children’s
summer camps, or shop assistants taken on purely for Christmas),
and employees employed as maternity or sickness locums. It is still a
fixed-term contract, even if it contains a clause allowing the
employer or employee to terminate it on notice during its course.79 A
permanent employee is one who is not employed on a fixed-term
contract.80 The FTE Regs 2002 do not apply where the employee is
an agency worker.81 Apprentices and employees on certain
government training or work experience schemes are also
excluded.82
A fixed-term employee has the right not to be treated less
favourably than a comparable permanent employee because s/he is a
fixed-term employee as regards contract terms or by being subjected
to any other detriment.83 A comparable permanent employee is
someone who, at the time of the less favourable treatment, is

1.44

employed by the same employer on broadly similar work (having
regard to similar levels of qualification and skills), and who is based
at the same establishment or if there is no one comparable at the
same establishment, then based at a different establishment.84 Subject
to the defence of justification (below), an employer must not give a
fixed-term employee less favourable access than a permanent
employee to benefits such as Christmas bonuses, free gym
membership, travel loans, training courses or occupational pension
schemes, or deny him/her promotion opportunities or select him/her
first for redundancy, purely because s/he works fixed-term.
However, it is not contrary to the FTE Regs 2002 to dismiss fulltime employees just short of the qualifying period for unfair
dismissal protection, even though no similar action is taken against
permanent employees.85 Where the fixed-term employee does the
same work as several permanent employees whose contract terms
are different, s/he may choose who to compare him/herself with. It is
also unlawful unjustifiably to treat a permanent employee less
favourably because s/he was a fixed-term employee in the past, eg by
failing to take account periods of time worked on fixed-term
contracts when assessing service-based pay.86
Employers have a defence if the less favourable treatment can be
‘justified on objective grounds’.87 An employer should balance the
rights of individual employees against business objectives and
consider justification on a case-by-case basis. It is generally thought
that treatment will be justified if it is to achieve a legitimate
objective, if it is necessary to achieve that objective and if it is an
appropriate way to achieve that objective.88 This is similar to the
test used under the EqA 2010 for justifying indirect discrimination.
Another way an employer can justify less favourable treatment is if
the terms of the fixed-term employee’s contract, taken as a whole, are
at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent
employee’s contract.89 This ‘package approach’ may not be lawful
under the directive.90 It will also not necessarily amount to less
favourable treatment where the pro rata principle applies,91 eg
where an employer pays for annual health insurance and an employee

1.45

1.46

on a six-month fixed-term contract is offered half the subscription
cost.
A fixed-term employee has the right to be informed of any
available permanent vacancies. It is sufficient if the vacancy is
contained in an advertisement which the employee has a reasonable
opportunity of reading in the course of his/her employment.92 Also,
once an employee has been continuously employed on two or more
fixed-term contracts for four years, the contract becomes permanent
unless keeping the employee on a fixed-term contract is objectively
justified.93 A collective or workforce agreement can modify the
rule.94 Continuous employment for this purpose is calculated in the
same way as it is to qualify for unfair dismissal protection,95 so that
certain breaks between fixed-term contracts may be counted in. For
example, teachers employed on nine-month or term-time only
contracts may be able to claim permanent status after four years if
they can show their service through the breaks is continuous by
reason of custom and arrangement or as temporary cessation only,
and the employer cannot justify keeping them on fixed-term contracts.
An employee can request a written statement confirming his/her
new status as permanent employee or, if this is disputed, explaining
the justification for the contract remaining fixed-term.96 Employees
place a great value on being given ‘permanent’ status, but it is not
always as important as they think. Employees qualify for unfair
dismissal protection as soon as they build up two years’ service,
whether they are employed on a permanent or fixed-term contract.97
Admittedly, having permanent status as opposed to working on a
short-term contract may make the employee less vulnerable to
dismissal in practice.

Enforcement
1.47

An employee who thinks s/he may have been less favourably treated,
may make a written request to the employer to supply written reasons
for the treatment within 21 days.98 If the employer fails to answer or
is evasive, the ET may draw an adverse inference in any subsequent
tribunal proceedings. If the treatment concerned is dismissal, the

1.48

1.49

employee cannot make a request under the FTE Regs 2002, but can
make an equivalent request for written reasons for dismissal under
ERA 1996 s92.99
If a fixed-term employee believes s/he has been less favourably
treated than a comparable permanent employee, or that his/her rights
have been infringed under the FTE Regs 2002 in any other way, s/he
can bring an ET claim within three months.100 Late claims may be
allowed if it is just and equitable to do so. The ET has power to
make a declaration as to the employee’s rights, to order
compensation and to make recommendations that the employer take
certain action.101 The amount of compensation will be what the ET
thinks is just and equitable having regard to the infringement and any
loss attributable to it. No award may be made for injury to feelings
for less favourable treatment as a fixed-term employee.102
It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee because
s/he has done anything under the FTE Regs 2002 including alleging,
eg in a grievance, that the employer has infringed the regulations
(except where the allegation is false and not made in good faith),
bringing ET proceedings, giving evidence or requesting a written
statement, or because the employer believes or suspects the
employee has done or intends to do any of these things.103 It is also
unlawful to submit an employee to a detriment for these reasons.104

Agency workers
1.50

1.51

Employment agencies and businesses are regulated by the Conduct of
Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations
2003.105 There are statutory requirements for the provision of clear
written information about terms and conditions before starting the
relationship.
Agency workers can claim unfair dismissal or discrimination,
provided they meet the necessary eligibility requirements for those
statutory rights, which may be difficult.106 Some other employment
rights explicitly cover agency workers. This section is about equal

1.52

1.53

1.54

1.55

treatment of agency workers compared with the hirer’s permanent
workers.
The Agency Workers Regulations (AW Regs) 2010107 were passed
in order to implement the EU Agency Worker Directive.108 They
came into force on 1 October 2011. Some key aspects of the AW
Regs 2010, which the directive left to national discretion, were
based on a formal agreement between the Trades Union Congress
(TUC) and Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The AW Regs
2010 are complicated to read. The Department for Business, Energy
& Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has issued Agency Workers
Regulations 2010: Guidance (updated October 2019).109 This
guidance has no legal status, but may help in understanding the law.
The following is only a brief summary, and the AW Regs 2010 need
to be consulted if running a case.
The AW Regs 2010 protect agency workers supplied by a
temporary work agency110 to work temporarily for and under the
direction of a hirer.111 ‘Temporary’ means ‘not permanent’ and
probably excludes arrangements of indefinite duration.112 In caselaw concerning agency workers in other contexts, the hirer tends to
be referred to as an end-user, though this is not a legal term. The AW
Regs 2010 do not cover situations where the agency or the hirer is a
client or customer of a profession or business carried on by the
worker.113
It helps to appreciate that the AW Regs 2010 do not operate like
other rights, eg for fixed-term employees (see above). There is no
general right not to be discriminated against as an agency worker.
Instead, there are very specific rights to equal terms on certain
matters. Indeed, in some respects, it is permitted to treat agency
workers more favourably, eg by paying them more.114
Under reg 5, agency workers who meet the qualifying period are
entitled to certain of the same basic working and employment
conditions as if they had been directly recruited by the hirer, whether
as an employee or as a worker. The relevant terms and conditions
are those related to pay, the duration of working time, night work,
rest periods and annual leave.115 The ‘duration of working time’

1.56

1.57

does not mean the length of the working week or even the length of
particular shifts, but it does cover any maximum number of hours the
employer sets for a particular shift.116 ‘Pay’ (both amount and timing)
includes certain bonuses, commission and holiday pay, but not the
amount of detail on a payslip. There are various excluded payments,
eg occupational sick pay, pension, redundancy pay and payment in
respect of maternity leave.117 The overtime rate and when it is
triggered (eg after working a 39 hour week) is covered, but the
opportunity to work overtime is not.118 The fact that an agency
worker is paid a higher hourly rate does not mean that the other terms
can be less favourable.119
The agency worker satisfies the qualifying period when s/he has
worked in the same role with the same hirer at some stage during
each of 12 continuous weeks during one or more assignments.120 An
‘assignment’ means the period of time that the worker is supplied by
one or more agencies to the hirer.121 The worker is taken to have
worked ‘in the same role’ unless s/he has started a new role with the
same hirer which has work or duties which are substantively
different to the previous role and the agency has told the worker in
writing of the type of work involved in the new role.122 Usually if a
worker stops working for the hirer and goes back again later, s/he
will have to start counting the 12 weeks all over again. But in some
situations, s/he can add in his/her previous work for the hirer,123 eg
where the break is for no more than 6 weeks or for any leave to
which the worker is entitled under his/her contract or statute
including annual leave and maternity leave. There are specific rules
where the worker cannot complete the assignment due to pregnancy,
maternity, adoption or paternity leave.
Once the qualifying period is achieved, the worker becomes and
remains entitled to the same basic working and employment
conditions until s/he stops working in the same role for that hirer or
there is a break which is not covered by the previously mentioned
rules.124 Unusually, the AW Regs 2010 include anti-avoidance
provisions. Where the structure of a worker’s assignments with a
particular hirer suggest the hirer or the agency intended to prevent the

1.58

1.59

1.60

worker from acquiring reg 5 rights, the qualifying period will be
deemed to have been completed at the time when it would have been
completed had no such measures been taken.125 The AW Regs 2010
set out factors to be taken into account when deciding whether the
most likely explanation for the structure of the assignments is such an
intention, eg the number and length of assignments and breaks in
between and the number of different roles worked by the agency
worker.126 An example where the pattern of assignments might
indicate a deliberate attempt to avoid a worker acquiring sufficient
qualifying service would be where a single agency worker is given a
series of 11-week assignments with seven-week breaks in between
and no obvious ‘innocent’ reason why this should have happened.
As well as the reg 5 entitlement, after 12 weeks, to the same basic
working and employment conditions, agency workers have certain
other rights from day one. During an assignment, an agency worker
must be treated no less favourably than a comparable worker in
relation to the collective facilities and amenities provided by the
hirer, eg access to the canteen, childcare facilities and transport
services.127 Unlike reg 5 rights, the worker must compare him/herself
with an actual comparator, usually an employee or worker of the
hirer who works at the same establishment and is engaged in the
same or broadly similar work.128 It is not unlawful to treat an agency
worker less favourably if so doing can be objectively justified.
During an assignment, an agency worker also has the right to be
told by the hirer of any relevant vacant posts, so that (in theory) s/he
has the same opportunity as a comparable permanent employee or
worker to get a permanent job with the hirer.129 The agency worker
does not have an equal right actually to apply for the vacancies, so
this entitlement to information is only useful in making sure the
worker does not miss an opportunity which is in fact openly
advertised.130
An agency worker who believes the hirer or the agency may have
infringed his/her rights under the AW Regs 2010, can make a written
request for a written statement within 28 days containing information
about the treatment in question.131 In any subsequent ET case for

1.61

1.62

breach of the AW Regs 2010, a tribunal can draw an adverse
inference if it believes the agency or the hirer deliberately, and
without reasonable excuse, gave an evasive or equivocal reply or
failed to answer altogether.
It is unlawful to subject an agency worker to a detriment because
s/he has brought a claim under the AW Regs 2010, given evidence or
information in connection with such a claim, requested a written
statement, alleged that the agency or hirer has breached the AW Regs
2010, refused or proposed to refuse to forgo a right conferred by the
AW Regs 2010 or otherwise done anything under the AW Regs
2010.132 It is not unlawful if the allegation was false and not made in
good faith. This protection is similar to the law of victimisation
under the EqA 2010. It is also automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss
an agency worker who is an employee for any of those reasons.
An agency worker can bring a tribunal claim if his/her rights under
the AW Regs 2010 are infringed by the hirer or the agency.133 The
claim must be brought within three months of the infringement or if
there is a series of infringements, within three months of the last one.
An ET can consider a late claim if it is just and equitable to do so. If
the worker wins the case, the ET can make a declaration and a
recommendation that the respondent take certain action for the
purpose of reducing the adverse effect on the worker of the unlawful
actions.134 The ET can also order any compensation which it
considers just and equitable, which in respect of some of the rights
must be no less than two weeks’ pay.135 Where the ET found the
agency or hirer was in breach of the anti-avoidance provisions, it
may make an additional award up to £5,000. No compensation is
awarded for injury to feelings.

References
1.63

There is usually no obligation on an employer to provide a worker
with a reference on termination of the employment contract. An
exception is where a reference is required by a regulatory body such
as the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to ensure that financial
services are only handled by authorised and competent persons.

1.64

1.65

1.66

1.67

If an employer does provide a reference to a third party, that
employer owes a duty of care to the person to whom the reference is
provided. Furthermore, a corresponding duty is owed to the worker
who is the subject matter of the reference. It is necessary for the
reference to be true, accurate and fair. Also the reference must not
give an unfair or misleading impression overall, even if the discrete
components are factually correct.136
A worker can sue an employer if s/he has suffered loss due to a
negligent reference, either for breach of an implied term of the
contract or in negligence.137 The duty imposed on the employer is to
ensure that the reference is fair, just and reasonable and the author of
the reference should take all reasonable care to ensure that there is
no misstatement. Negligent misstatement is where the employer,
honestly but carelessly, makes a false statement of fact or opinion in
the reference or in any other communication to a new employer.138
Employers should confine unfavourable statements about the
employee to those matters into which they had made reasonable
investigation and had reasonable grounds for believing to be true.139
It is also possible to sue an employer for defamation or malicious
falsehood in the provision of a reference.
In practical terms, it can be difficult for a worker to do anything if
s/he suspects a bad reference has been given. It may be hard to
obtain a copy of the reference, even from the proposed new
employer. There is no right of access under the Data Protection Act
(DPA) 2018 to a confidential reference.140 Any claim for a negligent
or false reference would usually only be enforceable in the county
court or High Court. If s/he has been unable to get the reference any
other way and has sufficient grounds, the worker may be able to get
pre-action disclosure. Realistically, the worker will probably not
want to bring a case in the civil courts. Sometimes the best and
simplest thing to do is to send a solicitor’s letter to the former
employer warning him/her of the consequences of unjustified
references. This may prevent the employer doing it again.
An employer may give a discriminatory reference or victimise a
worker by giving an adverse reference or no reference because the

1.68

worker alleged discrimination during his/her employment or brought
a case after leaving.141 The advantage of a discrimination claim, if it
can be brought, is that it is run in an ET, and it may be possible to get
details and even a copy of the reference, through the non-statutory
questionnaire procedure142 before starting any case.
These days, many employers give a purely factual reference
confirming dates of employment and job title, to avoid any
possibility of action being taken against them. Unfortunately such a
reference can be of limited value to the worker. Because of the
above difficulties, it is usually important to obtain an agreed
reference as part of any settlement negotiated on an unfair dismissal
or discrimination case.

Data protection
The legal framework
1.69

Data protection is required by the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR)143 and the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 (plus
some specialist statutory instruments). The DPA 2018 and GDPR
replaced the previous DPA 1998 and EC Data Protection Directive
from 25 May 2018. Roughly 80 per cent of the law has not changed,
but there are some differences, particularly in strengthening of
individuals’ rights over their own data. The EU GDPR has been
retained in domestic law as the UK GDPR alongside an amended
version of the DPA 2018. There is an Information Commissioner
whose role is to uphold information rights in the public interest. The
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has power to advise, take
enforcement action and issue codes and guidance. The ICO’s website
is very informative and has detailed guidance, although much of it
has still to be updated to reflect the GDPR changes.144 At the time of
writing, the best starting point is the ‘Guide to Data Protection’,
which provides an overview of the new legislation, and the ‘Guide
to the UK GDPR’, which takes you through the detailed rules.145 The
ICO’s Employment practices code146 has not yet been updated and
therefore needs to be read very carefully. However, it still contains

1.70

1.71

much good practice. The Code has four parts: Part 1 concerns
recruitment and selection; Part 2 concerns employment records; Part
3 concerns monitoring at work; and Part 4 concerns medical
information. The Code does not constitute the law, but it provides
useful guidelines on how the ICO will interpret the law.
The data protection rules are detailed and complex. The following
is intended only as a summary of the main data protection rules
which may be applicable in an employment context. It is advisable to
consult the ICO website before taking any action. Note also that the
government intends to make amendments in certain areas.
The DPA 2018 and GDPR provide data protection controls in all
fields of life. They contain a lot of jargon which cannot be avoided.
The ‘data controller’ is the person who decides the purposes and
means of processing personal data. The ‘processor’ is the person
responsible for actually processing the data on the controller’s
behalf. In the employment field, the data controller is usually a senior
decision-maker and the processor might be someone more junior.
The ‘data subject’, whose rights are protected, may be a job
applicant, trainee, existing employee or other worker. ‘Processing’
data or information includes collecting, recording, storing, using,
altering, retrieving, destroying and disseminating data.147

Which data is protected
1.72

1.73

Data protection law covers personal data stored on automated
systems, eg computers, CCTV or telephone logging systems, or paper
records filed in an organised way. Unstructured paper records held
on individuals by a public authority are an exception and do count as
personal data. This is so that the rules on ‘freedom of information’
can work (see para 1.91 below). However, this information is
exempt from most GDPR rules.148
‘Personal data’ means data related to a worker who can be
identified from the data alone or taken together with other
information which the employer has. Information which can identify
a worker could for example be a name, number or an online
identifier such as an IP address or cookie identifier.149 It is not

enough that the data simply refers to the worker. It must concern the
individual in some way. Relevant factors would be whether the data
is directly about the individual or his/her activities; what the data is
processed for; and what the effect of processing the data might be on
the individual. It would include an expression of opinion about the
worker or indication of someone’s intentions towards him/her, eg a
manager’s view on a worker’s promotion prospects.150 There is
detailed guidance on what is ‘personal data’ on the ICO website.151

The data protection principles
1.74

At the heart of the GDPR, there are six key data protection
principles, with which employers must comply.152 The controller is
responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with
these principles. Failure to comply can lead to substantial fines. In
summary, the principles are:
1) Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: to process personal data fairly, lawfully and
transparently. The lawful grounds for processing data are set out below.
2) Purpose limitation: to collect the data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. The
data must not be further processed in a way which is incompatible with those purposes.
3) Data minimisation: the data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary
for the purpose.
4) Accuracy: data should be kept accurate and up-to-date. Every reasonable step should be
taken to erase or update without delay where data is inaccurate. This links to the rights of
individuals to have inaccurate data rectified (see para 1.83 below).
5) Storage limitation: data from which individuals are identifiable should be kept for no
longer than is necessary for its purpose. It can be kept longer, eg for statistical purposes,
subject to safeguards. How long an employer should keep data depends on the reason it is
needed. The Information Commissioner says employers should review the information they
keep about workers once the workers have left the employment. Employers will need to
keep enough information to deal with reference requests and pension, for example, but
should delete information they are unlikely to need, such as personal contact details and
former addresses. Employers also should not normally keep recruitment applications of
unsuccessful candidates past the tribunal time-limits for bringing a claim.

6) Integrity and confidentiality: data should be processed in a way which ensures
appropriate security of the data including against accidental loss or destruction and
unauthorised processing.

As stated above, the data controller needs to have a lawful basis for
processing the data. This must be at least one of the six grounds set
out in GDPR Art 6, ie:

1.75

a)

the worker has given consent to the processing of his/her personal data for one or more
specific purposes. The GDPR operates a high standard for consent. Consent must be
explicit and entail a positive opt-in. It must also be possible to withdraw easily at any time.
Consent must be freely given. This is unlikely to be the case if it is a condition of
employment, so a paragraph in the contract of employment stating that the worker has
given consent may well not be enough;

b)

processing is necessary for the performance of the employment contract, eg bank account
information or sickness absence data so that statutory sick pay can be paid;

c)

processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation of the employer;

d)

processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the worker or someone
else;

e)

processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest;

f)

processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the employer or a
third party, except where such interests are overridden by a worker’s fundamental right to
privacy. This does not apply where a public authority is processing data to perform its
official tasks.

Processing of special categories of personal data – ie data revealing
racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation or sex life – or
the processing of genetic data, biometric data, or data concerning
health, is prohibited unless it falls within one of the exceptions in
GDPR Art 9. These include:

1.76

•

where the worker has given explicit consent;

•

where processing is necessary for an employer to carry out specific obligations or exercise
specific rights;

•

where it is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Workers’ rights
The right to be informed (privacy information)
1.77

Workers have the right to be informed, at the time that their employer
collects personal data from them, of certain privacy information.
This includes information as to the identity and contact details of the
data controller; the purposes and legal basis for the processing; the
recipients or categories of recipients of the data; the period for
which data will be stored or criteria used to decide that period; and
the existence of any automated decision-making with meaningful
information about the logic involved and the significance for the
worker. The worker must also be told about his/her right to request
access to data, rectification, erasure or restriction of processing, to
withdraw consent if the employer was relying on consent, and to
complain to a supervisory authority. Employers can put some of this
information on their website as long as workers are told of this and it
is easily accessible. If personal data is collected from other sources,
the worker must be told within a reasonable period and no later than
one month later. Certain exemptions apply.
Access to the data

1.78

Workers have a right of access to their own personal data, eg they
may ask for their computerised personnel information. The request
can be made to anyone in the organisation, and it can be made
verbally or in writing. Although employers may, as good practice,
have a standard form on which requests can be made, a request is
still valid if it is not made on such a form. Such requests are called
‘subject access requests’ (SARs), but the worker need not use that
term. The employer is not generally allowed to charge unless the
request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’, particularly because
it is repetitive, in which case the employer can charge a reasonable
administrative fee or refuse to act on the request.153 The information
must be provided without undue delay, and in any event, within one
month of the request. This can be extended by two further months if it
is necessary because of the complexity and size of request.154 The

1.79

1.80

1.81

1.82

information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible
and easily accessible form.155
Where the data reveals information about any other individual
including an individual who is the source of the information (eg the
author of an appraisal or reference), the employer can conceal
his/her identity or, if that is impossible, withhold the data. This is the
position unless the individual consents or it is reasonable for the
employer to dispense with his/her consent.156 It may be unreasonable
of the employer to refuse to dispense with consent where s/he has not
even tried to get it. In addition, workers are not entitled to see
employment references given or received in confidence by their
employer.157
There are other exceptions to the right of access including
documents which are legally privileged (ie confidential documents
between the employer and legal advisers), and information revealing
the employer’s intentions in any situation where s/he is negotiating
with the worker and revealing the information would be likely to
prejudice the negotiations.158 There is no right to data processed for
management planning if it would prejudice the conduct of the
business, eg confidential plans regarding future staff
reorganisations.159
There are special rules regarding whether data relating to the
worker’s health needs to be disclosed if it would be likely to cause
serious harm to the physical or mental health of the worker or anyone
else’s.160
It is permitted for employers to disclose personal data to others if
it is necessary for the purpose of, or in connection with, actual or
prospective legal proceedings or for obtaining legal advice or for
establishing, exercising or defending legal rights or because required
by a court or tribunal order.161 This can be important, for example,
where employers use the GDPR and DPA 2018 as a reason not to
answer pre-litigation questions.162
Correcting inaccurate data

1.83

It is contrary to the ‘accuracy’ data protection principle to hold
inaccurate data (see para 1.70 above). Workers have the right to have
inaccurate personal data rectified without undue delay and, taking
account of the purpose of the processing, to have incomplete data
completed.163 ‘Inaccurate’ means incorrect or misleading as to any
matter of fact.164 Opinions are inevitably subjective and are unlikely
to count as inaccurate data as long as it is clear that they are
opinions. Time limits for dealing with requests are the same as for
responding to subject access requests (see para 1.78 above). The
fees position is also the same. A worker can ask for the processing
of the data to be restricted while its accuracy is being sorted out.165
The right to restrict processing or have data erased

1.84

Workers can ask their employer to restrict the processing of their
data in certain circumstances, eg where accuracy is being verified
when they have contested it (as mentioned in the preceding
paragraph) or the employer no longer needs the data for processing
purposes but the worker wants it for a legal claim.166 Workers also
have the right to have their personal data erased or ‘forgotten’ in
certain circumstances, eg it has been unlawfully processed or
consent was required and the worker withdrew it, or processing is
no longer necessary.167 Even then, the right to erasure does not apply
in certain circumstances, eg the data processing is necessary to
comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or
defence of legal claims.
Automated decision-making and profiling

1.85

Workers have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on
automated processing (including profiling) which has legal or
similar effects, eg e-recruiting decisions without human
intervention.168 This restriction does not apply if the worker gives
explicit consent or (except for special category data), if it is
authorised by law or necessary for entering or performing the
contract of employment. There are various safeguards even when the
restriction does not apply, eg that the employer carry out a Data

Protection Impact Assessment and individuals must be given certain
meaningful information and have the right to contest the decision with
human beings. Note that this is an area where the government may
change the law.

Criminal records
1.86

As a general rule, employers must not require existing employees or
job applicants to supply records of criminal convictions, unless it is
in the public interest or required or authorised by law.169 Where it is
proper for employers to know if a worker has a criminal record, they
can do so with the worker’s consent through the Disclosure and
Barring Service (DBS), which has replaced the Criminal Records
Bureau (CRB). To avoid employers circumventing the safeguards
built into the DBS process, it is a criminal offence in certain
circumstances for an employer to require employees or job
applicants to use their subject access rights under the GDPR and
DPA 2018 to gain access to information about their convictions and
cautions and to pass it on to the employer. Details of the DBS are on
the GOV.UK website.170

Enforcement
1.87

If any of the data protection principles are not complied with, the
worker can either go directly to court or approach the Information
Commissioner. The rules are set out in Part 6 of the DPA 2018. The
ICO has powers to carry out assessments and issue enforcement
notices. It can also issue substantial penalty notices.

Monitoring at work
1.88

Some employers may monitor their workers – eg by CCTV, by
opening emails, examining logs of internet websites visited, checking
telephone logs for calls to premium lines, and even arranging video
evidence outside the workplace to check whether a worker is
genuinely sick. It is potentially a breach of the first data principle in
the GDPR171 to carry out this monitoring. In theory it could also

1.89

breach the Human Rights Act 1998 (see below). However, there
does not seem to be an absolute right not to be monitored, especially
if the worker has been informed in advance that monitoring will take
place. Part 3 of the Data Protection Code concerns monitoring at
work and provides useful guidelines, although it does not amount to
the law in itself.172 Also bear in mind that the Code has not, at the
time of writing, been updated to incorporate the GDPR and DPA
2018. The Code seeks to balance the rights of workers with the
needs of employers.
The Code stresses that workers have a legitimate expectation to a
degree of privacy in the workplace. Monitoring of private
information is intrusive and should be avoided if possible. Even a
ban on private email and internet use does not in itself allow the
employer to access messages that are clearly private. Any monitoring
which is carried out should be for a clear purpose and, ideally,
justified by an impact assessment. This means the employer should
have, formally or informally, weighed up his/her business needs
against the adverse impact of monitoring and alternative ways of
meeting the needs. Workers should be made aware of the nature,
extent and reasons for any monitoring, except in exceptional
circumstances where covert monitoring is justified, eg where there
are grounds for suspecting criminal activity. The Code notes that
continuous video and audio monitoring is particularly intrusive and
only justifiable in rare situations, eg where security is a particular
issue. Employers should also avoid opening workers’ personal
emails as this is especially intrusive. Workers should be told if their
emails are to be opened and checked in their absence. If workers are
to be monitored on their use of telephones, emails and internet, there
should be a clear policy as to the permitted use of such systems (eg
how much personal use is allowed; what kind of use is prohibited)
and the penalties for breaching the policy. For a worker’s rights if
the GDPR and DPA 2018 are not complied with, see para 1.87. Most
employers will not like the prospect of the Information
Commissioner investigating their data arrangements. A threat by
workers to request a Commissioner assessment may be a useful way

1.90

to persuade an employer to reduce or abandon the idea of
monitoring.
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)
(respect for private and family life) and possibly Article 10
(freedom of expression) may provide protection in some
circumstances. Interception of calls made on a worker’s office
telephone without his/her prior knowledge is a breach of the right to
privacy.173 Covert or even open video surveillance of people in their
workplace is a considerable intrusion into their private life and can
be a breach of Article 8 unless there is an extremely good reason and
appropriate safeguards.174 Proportionate monitoring or surveillance
for disciplinary purposes may or may not be a breach of Article 8,
depending on these factors: whether the employer has given advance
notification of the monitoring and its nature; the extent of monitoring
and the degree of intrusion into the employee’s privacy; the
employer’s justification, which needs to be stronger if the monitoring
is particularly intrusive; the consequence of the monitoring for the
individual; whether it is possible to devise a less intrusive
monitoring system; and whether the employee is provided with
adequate safeguards These principles will be relevant in an unfair
dismissal case where an employee is dismissed for improper use of
telephone, email or internet or on the basis of evidence obtained by
surveillance.175 For the use in ET cases of evidence obtained from
covert surveillance, see para 3.25. The law on privacy is a
developing area and the above is just a brief introduction.

Freedom of information
1.91

The Freedom of Information Act (FIA) 2000 and the Freedom of
Information (Scotland) Act (FI(S)A) 2002 came into effect on 1
January 2005. The FIA 2000 applies to public authorities in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland, UK government departments, parliament
and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The FI(S)A 2002
applies to Scottish public authorities, the Scottish Executive and
Scottish Parliament. It is similar to the FIA 2000, but gives slightly
better rights.

1.92

1.93

1.94

1.95

1.96

FIA 2000 Sch 1 lists the public authorities to which it applies and
this list is updated every October. Some authorities are listed by
category and others are precisely described. The list includes central
and local government, the health sector, the education sector, the
Employment Tribunals Service (ETS) and the police. The UK
Information Commissioner has produced very useful guidance notes
on her website176 and the Scottish Information Commissioner also
has a helpful site.177 There is also interesting information on the
website of the Campaign for Freedom of Information.178
Under FIA 2000 s19, all public authorities must produce a
publication scheme, which sets out what kinds of information the
public authority will proactively make available, how it can be
accessed and the cost. Very often these schemes are published on the
authorities’ websites. The scheme must be approved by the
Information Commissioner.
A member of the public can request any information held by the
public authority,179 whether or not it appears on the published
scheme. ‘Information’ is wider than ‘data’ covered by the DPA 2018
and GDPR. It covers information which is recorded in any form,
including paper records, handwritten notes, computer information
and information on audio cassettes and videos. Information which is
purely in the knowledge of the authority but unrecorded is not
covered.
A request should be in writing, state clearly what information is
required, and state the name of the applicant and an address for
correspondence.180 The request should be sent to someone
appropriate, eg the authority’s freedom of information officer, if it
has one, or the chief executive. The authority must respond as soon
as possible and no later than 20 working days after receiving the
request.181 The response must either provide the information or
explain why it has not been provided, quoting an exemption under the
FIA 2000.
There are two categories of exempt information: information
which is absolutely exempt and information which is exempt if the
authority can prove the public interest in keeping it exempt is greater

1.97

1.98

1.99

than the public interest in its disclosure. Absolute exemptions
include information contained only in court documents, personal data
about the applicant (because there is a right of access under the DPA
2018 and GDPR) or about another individual, if disclosure would
breach the DPA 2018 and GDPR, and information whose disclosure
would be a breach of confidence at common law. Public interest
exemptions include information covered by legal professional
privilege and information whose disclosure is likely to prejudice
commercial interests. It is advisable to look at the full list of
exemptions before making a request.182
Broadly speaking, the authority may charge a fee of £25 per hour,
but it cannot charge (except for photocopying and post) for requests
costing less than £450 to answer (£600 for requests to central
government). If it costs more than these figures to search out the
information, the authority can either charge or refuse to supply the
information altogether.183 In Scotland, the maximum fee is £15/hour
with no charge at all for the first £100 and thereafter only ten per
cent of charges over £100 and up to £600.184
If a request is refused, it is possible to apply for an internal
review of the decision (reviews are compulsory only in Scotland). If
the review also fails, the Information Commissioner can be asked to
review the decision.
Workers or trade unions may be able to use freedom of
information requests to get information from public authorities which
they cannot get in any other way. The FIA 2000 does not place
restrictions on how the information supplied under it may be used,
although certain types of confidential information may be exempt
from disclosure. However, if the information sought by the worker
concerns him /herself, s/he must apply under the DPA 2018 and
GDPR, which involves a different procedure.185

Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations

Chapter 2: Key points
•

•
•

•

•

•

•
•

It is unlawful to subject a worker to a detriment including
dismissal for joining or not joining a trade union or participating
in trade union activities in various ways.
A worker must not be offered an inducement to join or not join
a trade union or to surrender trade union rights.
It is unlawful to compile or sell a blacklist of people who are or
have been trade union members or involved in trade union
activities. Individuals can bring claims if they are discriminated
against as a result of such a list.
Trade union officials, learning representatives and members
are entitled to time off for trade union duties or activities in
strictly defined circumstances.
An employer must inform and consult the trade union or, if
none, employee representatives, when proposing to make
redundant or substantially change the terms and conditions of
20 or more employees.
An employer must inform and consult the trade union or, if
none, employee representatives, prior to a transfer of an
undertaking.
The Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations
cover wider areas of consultation with employees.
Under these regulations, employers with at least 50
employees must set up an information and consultation
mechanism if requested by two per cent of employees.

Inducements related to trade union membership
2.1

It is unlawful for an employer to make a worker an offer for the
purpose of inducing him/her to become or not to become a trade
union member, or not to take part in trade union activities or, as a
trade union member, not to use its services at an appropriate time.1

2.2

This includes a member consenting to a trade union raising a matter
on his/her behalf. It is also unlawful for an employer to make offers
which, if accepted, would mean that the worker’s terms of
employment, or any of those terms, will not or will no longer be
determined by collective agreement negotiated by the union, where
that is the employer’s sole or main purpose.2
Before the introduction of this legislation, the House of Lords had
said it was lawful for an employer to offer pay increases only to staff
who agree to sign personal contracts and relinquish their right to
union representation in pay negotiations.3 However, the European
Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) said that, by allowing employers to
use financial incentives to induce employees to surrender important
union rights, the UK was in breach of Article 11 of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).4 The ECtHR said it is the
essence of the right to join a trade union that employees should be
free to instruct or permit the union to make representations to their
employers or take action in support of their interests on their behalf.
If workers are prevented from doing so, their freedom to belong to a
union for the protection of their interests becomes illusory. As a
result of this case, the government made the above changes to the law
in 2004.

Detriment or dismissal for trade union reasons
Overview
2.3

It is unlawful to refuse a person employment because s/he is or is not
a trade union member. This includes the way s/he manifests his/her
membership, ie his/her trade union activities.5 In addition, it is
unlawful for an employer to subject a worker to a detriment
including dismissal or to fail to confer a benefit which would
otherwise be conferred, because of the worker’s refusal to accept an
inducement as set out in para 2.1. It is also unlawful to subject a
worker to a detriment by any act or deliberate failure to act for the
purpose of:

•

preventing or deterring the worker from being or seeking to become a member of a trade
union, or penalising him/her for doing so;6

•

preventing or deterring the worker from taking part in the activities of a trade union at an
appropriate time, or penalising him/her for doing so;7

•

preventing or deterring the worker from making use of the services of his/her trade union
at an appropriate time, or penalising him/her for doing so;8

•

compelling the worker to become a member of a trade union or a particular trade union.9

Where the worker is an employee, it is automatically unfair to
dismiss him/her or select him/her for redundancy if the sole or
principal reason for dismissal is that the employee:

2.4

•

was or proposed to become a member of a trade union;10

•

had taken part in or proposed to take part in the activities of a trade union at an appropriate
time;11

•

had made use of or proposed to make use of his/her trade union’s services at an
appropriate time, including giving consent to the union to raise a matter on his/her behalf, or
the trade union raised a matter on his/her behalf with or without his/her consent;12

•
2.5

2.6

had refused to accept an inducement as set out at para 2.1.13

There is only protection for activities which the worker did, or
services which s/he used, at the ‘appropriate time’. Appropriate time
is defined as a time which is either outside a worker’s working hours
or is within hours at a time which, in accordance with arrangements
agreed with, or consent given by, the employer, it is permissible for
the worker to take part in union activities.14 Working hours are those
hours which the worker is contractually required to be at work.
Lunch and tea breaks are usually outside working hours.15
The protection on taking part in the activities of an independent
trade union applies even if the union is not recognised. The type of
protected activity depends on whether it is a union official or
ordinary member claiming the protection. Both officials and
members would need to be acting within union rules and approved
practices for their role. Depending on their role, protected activities
could be recruitment and organisation, acting or being involved in
grievances and complaints,16 meetings and voting, and organising

2.7

industrial action.17 See below as regards actually participating in
industrial action.
Employers sometimes try to argue that the reason for dismissal is
not that the worker was carrying out trade union activities but the
way s/he was carrying them out. This is a dangerous distinction
which could in theory undermine the protection. However, the way
trade union activities are carried out is not relevant to whether they
are in fact trade union activities, unless the way they are carried out
is dishonest or in bad faith or for some extraneous cause.18 So the
normal rhetoric and hyperbole one would expect when a union tries
to recruit should fall within the scope of ‘activities’. On the other
hand, the contents of a speech made at a trade union recruiting
meeting could fall outside the term ‘trade union activities’ if they
were malicious, untruthful or irrelevant to the task in hand.

Industrial action
2.8

There are special rules regarding whether a worker dismissed while
taking industrial action can claim unfair dismissal.19 In addition,
under TULR(C)A 1992 s146, a worker must not be subjected to a
detriment for taking part in industrial action – or in order to prevent
or deter him/her from doing so. This includes action during working
hours. It would cover, for example, the employer taking disciplinary
action; however, an employer still need not pay a worker for days on
strike.20

Time off for trade union duties and activities
Officials
2.9

Regard must be had to the revised Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) Code of Practice 3 on time off for
trade union duties and activities (2010), which aims to aid and
improve the effectiveness of relationships between employers and
trade unions. The Code of Practice may be taken into account by
employment tribunals (ETs) when considering a claim which
concerns the subject matter of the Code.21 ACAS has also produced

a non-statutory guide – Trade union representation in the
workplace. The Code and the guide are available via links on the
ACAS website.22
An employer must allow an employee who is an official of an
independent trade union to take paid time off during working hours to
carry out his/her union duties.23 The duties are:24

2.10

•

negotiations connected with collective bargaining matters set out in TULR(C)A 1992
s178(2) in respect of which the union is recognised;

•

the performance on behalf of employees of functions related to the collective bargaining
matters set out in section 178(2) which the employer has agreed may be so performed by
the union;

•

receipt of information and consultation for collective redundancies or the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE Regs) 2006.25

2.11

2.12

2.13

2.14

The matters set out in TULR(C)A 1992 s178(2) include terms and
conditions or physical conditions of employment; disciplinary issues;
work allocation; trade union membership and facilities; machinery
for negotiation, consultation and other procedures. Para 13 of the
ACAS Code gives guidance on the scope of these.
Employers must also allow a trade union official paid time off for
industrial relations training26 relevant to carrying out his/her duties.27
This training must be approved by the Trades Union Congress (TUC)
or by the official’s own trade union.28 Section 2 of the ACAS Code
provides further guidance as to the type of training covered.
The amount of time off for duties or training must be reasonable in
all the circumstances. The ACAS Code provides guidance as to what
is reasonable. Regard must be had to the size of the organisation, the
production process, the need to maintain a public service, and safety
considerations. The test is objective and requires the balancing of the
competing interests of both parties.29
Where time off is given during working hours the employee is
entitled to be paid and the employer cannot allow time off if the
employee agrees it will not be paid.30
Note also that the Employment Relations Act (ERelA) 1999
entitles a worker, where there is a reasonable request, to be

accompanied by a work colleague or trade union official at
disciplinary and grievance hearings.31 The companion must be
allowed reasonable paid time off during working hours to attend the
hearing.32 A trade union official must be certified by the union as
being capable of acting as a worker’s companion.

Members
2.15

An employee who is a member of a recognised independent trade
union is entitled to a reasonable amount of unpaid time off to take
part in any activities of the union or activities in relation to which
s/he is acting as a representative of the union.33 Section 3 of the
ACAS Code gives examples of union activities, eg meeting and
voting on the outcome of negotiations with the employer; meeting
full-time officials to discuss workplace issues; voting in strike
ballots and union elections; representation at the union’s annual
conference or regional committees. Industrial action is excluded.34

Remedies
2.16

An employee can complain to an ET about the failure to permit time
off for trade union duties or activities, or, in the case of trade union
duties, failure to pay for any time off which is permitted.35 The claim
must be presented within three months of the refusal or failure to
pay.36 Where there has been a failure to give time off, the ET can
award compensation which it considers just and equitable.37

Time off for union learning representatives
2.17

Employees who are members of an independent trade union
recognised by the employer can take reasonable paid time off to
undertake the duties of a union learning representative, provided the
union has given the employer written notice that the employee is a
learning representative and has undergone sufficient training for the
role.38 Activities covered include providing information and advice
about learning or training matters and analysing needs, promoting the

value of training and learning, arranging it and consulting with the
employer. Learning representatives are also allowed reasonable paid
time off to undergo training relevant to their functions.39 The ACAS
Code40 gives further guidance.

Blacklisting of trade unionists
2.18

2.19

2.20

After long delays, legislation outlawing blacklisting of trade
unionists was at last passed in 2010 by the Employment Relations
Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010.41 The Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills (now the Department for Business,
Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS)) issued guidance, though this
has no special legal status, The blacklisting of trade unionists.42
The regulations make it unlawful to compile, use, sell or supply a
‘prohibited list’. A ‘prohibited list’ is a list which contains details of
people who are or have been members of trade unions or people
who are taking part or have taken part in trade union activities, eg by
attending union meetings, writing for a union newsletter, standing for
office or participating in official industrial action. The list must have
been compiled with a view to being used by employers or
employment agencies for the purposes of discrimination on grounds
of trade union membership or activities in relation to recruitment or
the treatment of workers.
An individual can bring an ET case if an employer dismisses
him/her or refuses to employ him/her or subjects him/her to some
other detriment for a reason related to a prohibited list, eg because
the employer has found out that s/he is a trade union member. Cases
can also be brought against employment agencies for refusing their
services for that reason. Cases must be brought within three months
of the action complained of, or later, if it is just and equitable to do
so. The rules are a little complicated and should be checked
regarding compensation limits according to whether the claimant is a
worker or an employee and whether the claim concerns detriment or
dismissal.

The statutory duty to consult in respect of
collective redundancy dismissals
2.21

2.22

2.23

TULR(C)A 1992 ss188–198 contain rules regarding consultation
with trade union or employee representatives where redundancies of
20 or more employees are proposed. The relevant sections in
TULR(C)A 1992 are intended to implement the Collective
Redundancies Directive.43
Certain employees are completely excluded, eg those in Crown
employment (working in a government department, etc), the police
and the army.44 Employees on fixed-term contracts are no longer
included within the redundancy consultation requirements unless it is
proposed to cut short their contracts as opposed to simply not
renewing them when they expire.45 Redundancy in this context
includes dismissals for any reason not related to the individuals
concerned, eg reorganisation or in order to harmonise terms and
conditions, as opposed to dismissals for redundancy in the normal
sense (as in paras 8.2–8.8).46 Therefore, consultation is required
where the employer proposes to vary employees’ contracts in order
to offer new contracts on different terms.47 It will also be required
where the proposal is to redeploy staff following redundancy on
substantially different contracts.48 Where there is a simultaneous
TUPE transfer, the TUPE consultation rules also apply (see para
2.31 onwards). In addition, a prospective transferee who proposes
redundancies can start redundancy consultation before the transfer
takes place if it gives a written notice to the transferor and the
transferor agrees.49
Consultation must take place with the appropriate representatives
of any employees who may be affected by the proposed dismissals or
by measures taken in connection with those dismissals.50 This means
the representatives of the recognised trade union, or if there is none,
correctly elected employee representatives.51 Affected employees
could include employees who are not going to be made redundant,
but who may experience a change in their working conditions as a
result of the redundancies. There are rules covering the position

where there is no trade union and employee representatives have not
been elected.52
The duty arises when an employer is proposing to dismiss as
redundant 20 or more employees at one establishment within a
period of 90 days or less.53 Volunteers who were selected for
redundancy can be counted in.54 There is no precise legal definition
of what an ‘establishment’ under TULR(C)A 1992 is, but it can be
(and often is) something less than the whole organisation.55
Employers sometimes try to avoid their consultation obligations by
claiming that the employees are spread across several
establishments, arguing that different buildings, departments or even
floors are separate establishments. The Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) has given some general guidance in a few
cases:

2.24

•

Essentially, an ‘establishment’ is the unit to which the employees to be made redundant
were assigned to carry out their duties.

•

An establishment need not have any legal, economic, financial, administrative or
technological autonomy, or even geographical separation. Nor does it need to have a
management that can independently choose to make collective redundancies. It may be
enough if, for example, it is a distinct entity with a certain degree of permanence and
stability, which is assigned to perform one or more given tasks and which has a workforce,
technical means and a certain organisational structure allowing for the accomplishment of
those tasks.56

•

Each case should be looked at on its facts and tribunals are likely to make findings which
encourage consultation.

•

Although not essential, geographical separation, permanence, exclusivity of employees, and
managerial and administrative independence are still relevant factors.

•

An individual’s place of work may be the best guide, but not in the sense of a particular
office or even a particular building, but a wider idea of workplace, eg a group of buildings
or a factory complex.57 A useful rule of thumb may be what an employee would say if
asked where s/he works. For example, the ‘establishment’ in which a university laboratory
assistant works may well be the particular campus where s/he is located, and for a teacher,
a school within the area of an education authority may well be an establishment in itself.
The fact that the education authority holds certain central management powers over its
schools does not mean that any given school is not a separate ‘establishment’.

•

It is inevitable – and therefore not necessarily significant – that an organisation retains
some central powers over its various establishments.58 It does not stop a place being an
independent establishment that the employees employed there have mobility clauses in their
contracts. On the other hand, if staff are peripatetic, eg music and drama staff employed
by a council to visit and carry out their duties at several schools, the ‘establishment’ may be
wider, such as the council’s education and leisure service.

2.25

2.26

2.27

Consultation must begin in good time and in any event, where the
employer is ‘proposing’ to dismiss 100 or more employees, at least
45 days before the first dismissals take effect; where the employer is
proposing to dismiss at least 20 but fewer than 100 employees, then
at least 30 days before.59 The period of 45 days was reduced from a
period of 90 days by the coalition government in April 2013. A
dismissal takes effect in this context when notice is given.60 The
obligation to consult does not start when an employer is simply
thinking about the possibility of redundancies. The employer must
have a fixed, clear, albeit provisional intention to make
redundancies.61 Consultation must also be completed before notice
of any dismissal is given.62
Consultation is supposed to be with a view to reaching
agreement.63 This means negotiation.64 It is strongly arguable that for
meaningful consultation to take place, it should start as early as
possible. Employers do not need to consult on the economic
decisions forming the background to redundancies, eg decisions to
close certain branches of a chain.65 However, where the closure
decision would inevitably lead to redundancies, that might be
different.66 In the Nolan case, the Court of Appeal asked the CJEU to
clarify whether the Collective Redundancies Directive requires an
employer to consult over a strategic decision which will inevitably
lead to redundancies, or only once such a decision has been made.67
Unfortunately, the CJEU was unable to decide the case because the
directive does not apply to the dismissal of staff from a military
base, which is what happened in Nolan. At some point, the UK
courts will have to make a decision, but currently it is unresolved.68
Consultation must at least cover ways of avoiding or reducing the
numbers of dismissals and mitigating the consequences of the

dismissals.69 To be meaningful, it should take place when the
proposals are still at a formative stage; the representatives must have
sufficient information and adequate time in which to respond; and the
employer must give conscientious consideration to the response.70
However, the employer cannot be forced to agree with the
representatives or change any plans. Employers must ensure
consultation covers the topics required. It is not enough simply to
provide the opportunity to consult.71
For the purposes of consultation, the employer must disclose in
writing to the representatives:

2.28

•

the reason for the redundancy proposals;

•

the numbers and descriptions of the workers whom it is proposed to dismiss as redundant;

•

the total number of workers employed at the establishment in question;

•

the proposed method of selection; the manner in which the dismissals are to be carried out;
and

•

the proposed method of calculating the redundancy payments.

The employer must also disclose:

2.29

•

the number of temporary agency workers under its supervision and direction;

•

the parts of its undertaking where they are working; and

•

the type of work they are carrying out.72

Where there is no trade union and the employees have failed to elect
representatives after being invited to do so, the employer must give
each affected employee this information.73 The obligation to consult
does not wait until the employer is able to supply all the required
information; flexibility is essential, and the employer can and must
add information as it arises during the consultation process.74
The employer must also give BEIS written notification of his/her
proposal to make 20 or more employees redundant at least 30 days
before, and 100 or more employees redundant at least 45 days
before.75 The employer must give copies of the notice to the trade
union or employee representatives. Failure to notify is a criminal
offence.

Employers are excused from the duty to consult or provide
information only in special circumstances, eg a very sudden disaster.
However, tribunals are unlikely to consider it special circumstances
where there have been financial difficulties over a long period, or
where redundancies would seem to be inevitable. Even if special
circumstances exist, the employer must still do as much as is
reasonably practicable.76

2.30

Collective consultation on TUPE transfers
The employer’s duty to consult on a transfer is similar, although not
identical, to the duty to consult on mass redundancies. The EC
Business Transfers Directive77 is implemented by the TUPE Regs
2006.78
The employer of any affected employees must inform and consult
‘appropriate representatives’. The affected employees may be those
of the transferor or transferee, whether or not employed in the
undertaking to be transferred, who may be affected in some way by
the transfer or measures taken in connection with it.79 The
appropriate representatives are either the trade union or, if there is
none, correctly elected employee representatives.80 If the employees
fail to elect any representatives within a reasonable time, the
employer must give each affected employee the relevant
information.81 Where the employer has fewer than ten employees,
there are no appropriate representatives and the employer has not
invited employees to elect employee representatives, the employer
can comply with his/her obligations by treating each affected
employee as if s/he were an appropriate representative.82
The employer must provide the following information long enough
before the transfer occurs to enable consultation to take place:83

2.31

2.32

2.33

•

the fact of the transfer, its approximate date and the reasons for it;

•

the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer for the affected employees; the
legal implications need not be correct as long as the employer expresses a genuinely held
view and doesn’t just shut his/her eyes to the legal implications (though it is unlikely to

excuse a complete failure to inform or consult that an employer genuinely believes TUPE
does not apply);84
•

whether the employer envisages taking measures in relation to the affected employees and
if so, what these are;

•

if the employer is the transferor, s/he must also pass on any measures which the transferee
envisages. The transferee must give the transferor this information.85

2.34

2.35

2.36

The above information must include suitable information regarding
the use of temporary agency workers, ie the number working for the
employer, the kind of work they are doing and where.86
The obligation to inform is wider than the obligation to consult.
There is no obligation on employers to consult with regard to the fact
and reasons for the transfer. However, if employers envisage they
will take measures in connection with the transfer, they must consult
with a view to seeking the representatives’ agreement. ‘Measures’
can involve administrative arrangements or anything else done which
is not simply an inevitable consequence of the transfer.87 For
example, an arrangement by the transferor to make a payment in lieu
of accrued holiday or a change of pay date would be a ‘measure’,
whereas the mere fact that the transferee would now be paying wages
as opposed to the transferor would not. It is unnecessary for a
‘measure’ to be one which would cause the employees any
disadvantage.88
Employers should consider and reply to any representations made
by the representatives, giving reasons if they reject the suggestions.89
It appears that there is no duty on the transferee to consult with the
transferred employees after the transfer, which does seem to
undermine the duty to consult.90 Note that the obligation to inform
exists even if there will never be an obligation to consult because the
employer does not envisage taking any measures.91 Moreover, the
information must still be provided sufficiently well in advance for
any voluntary consultation to take place.92
As with redundancy consultation, delay or failure to consult can
only be justified in special circumstances, which will be hard for the
employer to prove.93

Remedies for failure to consult on redundancies
or transfers
2.37

2.38

If the employer fails to inform or consult, the remedy is to complain
to an ET. If the appropriate representative is the trade union, then the
complaint is made by the trade union, and otherwise, by the
employees’ representative.94 The remedy is in two stages. The first
stage is a declaration that the employer has failed to consult and an
ET may award compensation to each affected employee.95 The
second stage applies if the employer fails to pay, in which case the
individual employee must apply to an ET.96 Where there is no trade
union, if the employer has failed to take the correct steps in relation
to the election of employee representatives, an individual employee
can claim compensation for failure to inform or consult.97
Where an ET declares that there has been inadequate consultation
on collective redundancies, it can make a protective award, ordering
the employer to pay remuneration to individual employees for the
protected period. This period starts when the first dismissal takes
effect (or the date of the ET award if earlier), and lasts for as long as
the ET thinks just and equitable having regard to the seriousness of
the employer’s default. It cannot exceed 90 days’ pay.98 There are a
few circumstances in which an award cannot be made, eg for
unreasonably refusing an offer of suitable alternative employment by
the employer.99 The purpose of the award is to ensure consultation
takes place, and not to compensate individual workers. In deciding
how much to award, the emphasis is therefore on the extent of the
employer’s failure to consult, whether it was deliberate and whether
legal advice was available.100 Where there has been no consultation
at all, the starting point is to consider the 90-day maximum
(regardless of the minimum statutory consultation period applicable)
and to reduce it only if there are appropriate mitigating
circumstances.101 The award is not confined to 30 days simply
because the employer was proposing to dismiss fewer than 100
employees.102 Mitigating circumstances could be that the employer
had already discussed matters with the union at an earlier stage, or

2.39

that the employer would have been unable to consult for 30/45 days
anyway, because it very suddenly became insolvent.103 However,
insolvency is not in itself a reason not to make a protective award.104
Where there is a failure to give information or consult under the
TUPE Regs 2006, an ET can order the employer to pay appropriate
compensation to individual employees up to a maximum of 13
weeks’ pay for each employee. This is gross pay which is not subject
to any statutory cap.105 As with the protected award for failure to
inform and consult in collective redundancies, the purpose is to
provide a sanction against the employer, not to compensate the
employees. Therefore the employees need not show they have
suffered any actual financial loss. The starting point is again the
maximum award, which may then be discounted according to the
seriousness of the employer’s failure.106 A maximum award is
unlikely to be appropriate where an employer has given some
information, albeit inadequate, and where the measures requiring
consultation are of very limited significance.107 If the transferor did
not tell the representatives of its affected employees about any
measures envisaged by the transferee (see para 2.33), compensation
can only be claimed directly against the transferor, even if the reason
is that the transferee failed in its duty to inform the transferor what it
planned to do. This seems unfair, but if the transferor wants to hold
the transferee responsible, it can make the transferee party to the
tribunal proceedings by serving a notice under reg 15(5). The
tribunal can then order any compensation against the transferee. This
means the affected employees (via their representatives) must make
the claim against the transferor even if they believe the transferee is
the one at fault.108

Information and Consultation of Employees
Regulations
2.40

The Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations (ICE
Regs) 2004109 came into force on 6 April 2005, to implement the EC
Directive on Information and Consultation in the Workplace.110 The

2.41

2.42

regulations apply to undertakings with 50 or more employees.111 An
undertaking means a public or private undertaking carrying out an
economic activity, whether or not operating for gain.
Except in unionised workplaces, there will usually be no existing
mechanisms for information and consultation to take place. There are
two ways under the ICE Regs 2004 for starting negotiations to set up
such mechanisms. Either the employer voluntarily starts negotiations
to set up an ICE agreement112 or two per cent of the employees
(subject to a minimum of 15 and maximum of 2,500) put in a written
request for an agreement.113 Where there is a valid pre-existing
agreement,114 eg a trade union collective agreement which satisfies
the conditions, and fewer than 40 per cent of employees have
requested an ICE agreement, the employer has the option of balloting
the workforce as to whether they endorse the request for a new ICE
agreement, or – in effect – would prefer to leave things as they are.
Even if the workforce votes for a new ICE agreement, any collective
agreement would remain in force for other purposes. The Central
Arbitration Committee (CAC) adjudicates on breaches of the general
rights in the ICE Regs 2004 and has issued guidance for employers
and employees.115
The ICE Regs 2004 seemed to represent a culture change in the
UK, where traditionally worker representation is carried out through
trade union recognition. It was feared that the ICE Regs 2004 would
undermine trade unions in unionised workplaces by setting up
alternative structures, and that ICE representatives without trade
union experience would not be sufficiently experienced or supported
to negotiate effectively. In practice, the threats to trade union
organisation seem to have come more from the increasing
fragmentation of the workforce through factors such as privatisation,
use of agency workers and the gig economy, than specifically
because of the ICE Regs 2004, which are very little used.

European Union (EU) law has greatly influenced certain areas
of employment law, eg TUPE, collective consultation, equal
pay, pregnancy rights and discrimination.
EU law derives from the treaties and charters and from
directives. Domestic courts and tribunals must interpret
national law consistently with EU law as far as possible and in
some cases, must disapply conflicting national law.
Where EU law applies, cases can be referred by member
states to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to lay down
guidelines. Post Brexit, the UK can no longer make referrals to
the ECJ.
Following implementation period (IP) completion day (11 pm
31 December 2020), there is a body of ‘retained’ EU law, most
notably:
the right to equal pay under Treaty on the Functioning of
the European Union (Treaty of Rome) (TFEU) Article 157;
rights under EU directives which had been recognised by
the ECJ or any UK court or tribunal prior to this date.
Apart from the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and Inner
House of the Court of Session, UK courts/tribunals must follow
retained case law. They can choose to have regard to what
the ECJ says in future, but they are not bound by it.
UK legislation enacted after IP completion day will take
precedence over retained EU law.
The UK is a signatory to the European Convention on Human
Rights (ECHR). Decisions about the meaning and applicability
of the ECHR are made by the European Court of Human
Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. Cases can be taken against the
UK direct to the ECtHR, but it is likely to be expensive.
Under the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998, employment
tribunals and courts must take account of applicable ECHR

rights when deciding cases under UK law. The government has
in the past indicated it wants to abolish the HRA 1998.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is
part of EU law but does not apply in the UK post Brexit.

European Union law
Introduction
3.1

3.2

Over the years, the law of the European Union (EU) had become
increasingly influential in the employment field, most obviously in
the fields of discrimination, transfers of undertakings and health and
safety. When so many employment rights had been repealed since
2010, the existence of minimum European protection had become an
important safeguard.
The advantage of EU law is that its ambit is often wider than the
equivalent UK legislation. The extent to which individuals in the UK
could rely on EU law which conflicted with ‘domestic’ law (ie the
law of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) was already
complicated prior to Brexit. There is now an extra layer of
complexity in working out the post-Brexit position. The following is
only a brief and simplified outline and where issues arise, readers
will need to research further.

Retained EU law
3.3

On 31 January 2020 (‘exit day’), the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act (EU(W)A) 2018 repealed the European Communities Act 1972.
A transition period called the ‘implementation period’ (IP) then ran
until 11 pm on 31 December 2020 (‘IP completion day’). The
EU(W)A 2018 preserves these categories of EU law as they stood on
IP completion day:
1)

EU derived domestic legislation1, eg the Equality Act 2010 which implemented various
EU directives;

2)

Direct EU legislation operative immediately before IP completion day, but not EU
directives.2 It includes the EU GDPR;3

3)

Directly effective rights which individuals could enforce in courts and tribunals under an
EU Treaty, eg the right to equal pay under Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning
of the European Union (TFEU);

4)

‘Any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures’ which
were recognised and available in domestic law immediately before IP completion day.
This includes rights under EU directives provided they had been recognised by the
European Court of Justice (ECJ) or any UK court or tribunal in a case decided before
IP completion day.4

3.4

3.5

This ‘retained EU law’ takes precedence over any UK legislation
enacted prior to IP completion day. However, any UK legislation
enacted on or after IP completion day will take precedence over
retained EU law.5
The ultimate authority on EU law is the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU), which comprises the ECJ and the General
Court. In practice, the ECJ makes most of the employment-related
decisions.
Where a question arises as to the interpretation or applicability of
EU law, any national court or tribunal of a member state can ask the
ECJ to give a preliminary ruling if they are unsure what EU law
requires. The referring court/tribunal asks the ECJ a series of
questions relevant to the principles in its case. The ECJ’s judgment
takes the form of answers to those questions. The ECJ then sends the
matter back to the referring court/tribunal for it to apply the
guidelines to the facts of the particular case. Before it reaches a
decision, the ECJ seeks an opinion from an Advocate General. The
opinion tends to get published before the final judgment and is
usually, but not always, followed by the court. It is worth reading the
Advocate General’s opinion in a case because it often provides more
insight into the ECJ’s thinking than the rather terse judgments of the
court. There is now a large body of ECJ case-law developed from
cases referred by the various member states, in areas such as equal
pay, pregnancy and transfers of undertakings.

3.6

3.7

After IP completion day, UK courts and tribunals can no longer
make referrals to the ECJ for rulings on points of principle, and
future decisions by the ECJ will no longer be binding in the UK.
Nevertheless, domestic courts and tribunals can still ‘have regard to’
what the ECJ says in the future.6 Moreover, domestic courts and
tribunals must still follow retained EU and domestic case law, ie
cases decided prior to the IP completion day. However, the Supreme
Court, High Court of Judiciary in Scotland when sitting as a court of
appeal, the Court of Appeal in England and Wales (and in Northern
Ireland) and the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland can
all depart from retained case law where it appears right to do so –
basically this is in the same circumstances that the Supreme Court
would depart from its own decisions in the past (which is unusual).7
Given the body of retained law, it is likely to be necessary to
understand how EU law works for some years. The following
provides a broad overview.

Direct and indirect effect
3.8

3.9

3.10

Equal pay law is contained in an EU Treaty, but most EU equality
law is set out in a large number of directives and subsequent
interpretations by the CJEU in case-law. What happens if UK
domestic law and EU law conflict on a point?
EU law has ‘indirect effect’. In applying national law, and in
particular a national law specifically introduced to implement an EU
measure, national courts are required to interpret domestic law in the
light of the wording and purpose of the relevant EU directive. This is
sometimes referred to as the ‘Marleasing principle’.8 It may mean
that UK courts and tribunals must imply extra words into the national
legislation, provided these are compatible with the underlying thrust
of the legislation and do not go against its grain.9
Where a provision has ‘direct effect’ it may also be possible to
rely directly on the EU measure and, if necessary, conflicting UK law
must be disapplied. This would be important where the domestic
legislation just cannot be interpreted in a way which is consistent
with EU law. To have ‘direct effect’, the provision of EU law must

be clear and precise, unconditional and unqualified, and not need any
further implementing measures.10 A provision with ‘horizontal direct
effect’ can be directly relied on by workers bringing cases against
private or public sector employers. A provision which has ‘vertical
direct effect’ applies in that way only when the worker is claiming
against the government or an emanation of the state (see below).

The Treaty of Rome and its articles
3.11

3.12

3.13

The European Economic Community (EEC)11 was established by the
Treaty of Rome 1957 and it is this treaty which provides the original
basis for the establishment of employment rights. On 1 May 1999, the
Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, renumbering the articles of the
Treaty of Rome and making other amendments. On the whole, the
treaties impose obligations on member states which are enforceable
only by other member states. However, some key articles are directly
applicable and have horizontal direct effect as well as vertical direct
effect (see above). This means they can be used in claims brought by
individual citizens of the member states, even though they may not
have been implemented by the relevant member state. If necessary,
such articles override conflicting national law.
Under the Treaty of Rome, the articles with direct effect were
Article 119 requiring men and women to receive equal pay for equal
work, and Article 48 prohibiting discrimination in work on grounds
of nationality against nationals of other member states. An example
of the application of a treaty provision with horizontal direct effect is
when the Court of Appeal disapplied the requirement under the
former Equal Pay Act 1970 to have a male comparator, in a case
where a woman was paid less on grounds of pregnancy.12
The Treaty of Rome has been amended several times and the
articles renumbered. Most importantly for employment law, Article
119 was renumbered as Article 141 (when it was expanded to
include a reference in the treaty to equal treatment for the first time)
and is now Article 157 of the (renamed) TFEU.13 Article 48 was
renumbered Article 39 and is now Article 45.

Directives
The European Parliament, together with the Council and the
Commission, can make regulations, issue directives and make
recommendations.14 Examples of important directives issued over
the years are:

3.14

•

Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation or the principle of equal treatment for men
and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and
working conditions. This was known as the Equal Treatment Directive.15 In 2006 it was
consolidated with other directives relating to gender into the Recast Directive.16

•

Directive 2001/23/EC safeguarding employees’ rights on transfers of undertakings,
businesses or parts of businesses. This is known as the Business Transfers Directive.17

•

Directive 93/104/EEC (now contained in 2003/88/EC) concerning certain aspects of the
organisation of working time. This is known as the Working Time Directive.18

•

Directive 2000/43/EC on equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic
origin. This is known as the Race Discrimination Directive.

•

Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment
and occupation. This is known as the General Framework Directive or the Framework
Directive.

A member state must implement the contents of a directive into its
own national law by a given date. Unlike certain articles of the
Treaty, directives usually have only vertical direct effect.

What is an emanation of the state?
3.15

A useful definition of ‘emanation of the state’ is in Foster v British
Gas,19 where the ECJ said that the Equal Treatment Directive could
be used by individuals employed by any body made responsible by
the state for providing a public service under the control of the state
and which has special powers for that purpose. An ‘emanation of the
state’ includes local government, health authorities,20 the police,21
the Post Office and nationalised industries.22 In some circumstances,
privatised industries may remain an ‘emanation of the state’. A useful
case is Griffin v South West Water Services Ltd.23 In stating that a
privatised water company was an emanation of the state, the court

emphasised that it is the service, not the body, which needs to be
under state control. The Foster case gives indicators as to when an
employer may be considered an emanation of the state, but these will
not always apply, for example, it is not necessary to be under the
control of central government.24 The governing body of a voluntary
aided school can be considered an emanation of the state for these
purposes.25

Working abroad
3.16

There have been a number of cases in recent years regarding the
territorial scope of domestic employment rights, ie can workers
apparently based or working abroad bring claims such as unfair
dismissal, discrimination and holiday pay? This is an extremely
complicated area, with rapidly developing case-law. The Court of
Appeal in Hottak has now said that the same rules on territorial
jurisdiction apply to claims under the Equality Act 2010 as they do
to unfair dismissal claims (see para 6.16).26 Previously it was
suggested that where the employment contract is governed by English
law and the employment right in question derives from a European
directive, workers should be allowed to make a claim regardless of
any restrictions in domestic rules about territorial scope.27

The Charter of Fundamental Rights
3.17

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
(2000/C364/01) only started to gain recognition as a potential source
of legal protection relatively recently. The Charter contains 54
Articles which are said to be the core values of the EU. The Charter
has the same status as the EU Treaties, and certain Charter rights
have been held to have horizontal direct effect.28 However, the
Charter does not form part of domestic law following IP completion
day. There is potential uncertainty regarding the position where the
ECJ relied on the Charter as part of its reasoning in a decision which
was otherwise within the scope of retained case-law.29

Human rights
Introduction
The HRA 1998 was passed in order to incorporate the ECHR30 into
domestic law. It came into force on 2 October 2000. The government
has in the past indicated that it would like to repeal the HRA 1998. It
remains to be seen whether this will be feasible and what difference
it will make. As long as the UK remains a signatory to the ECHR,
individuals can claim against the UK directly in the European Court
of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. Such claims are not
dependent on the HRA 1998. The ECHR was ratified by the Labour
Government in 1951 and came into force in 1953.
Taking a case direct to the ECtHR is generally unfeasible because
of the costs involved and unfamiliar procedure. As long as the HRA
1998 remains in place, it should rarely be necessary, because the
HRA 1998 requires UK courts and tribunals to interpret domestic
legislation so far as is possible to give effect to the rights imposed
by the articles of the ECHR, and to take into account any relevant
decision of the ECtHR.31 Where it is not possible to do so, the
domestic legislation remains unaltered thereby preserving
parliamentary sovereignty. However, ECHR rights can generally be
enforced directly against public authorities.32 The Equality and
Human Rights Commission (EHRC)33 has a remit to promote human
rights, but no power to take up individual cases.

3.18

3.19

The Articles of the Convention
The HRA 1998 incorporates Articles 2–12 and 14 of the ECHR, but
not Article 13.34 The Articles which have been most relevant in the
employment field include:

3.20

•

Article 4 (the right not to be held in slavery and to be protected against forced or
compulsory labour);

•

Article 5 (the right to liberty and security of the person);

•

Article 6 (the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable period of time);

•

Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life);

3.21

•

Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion);35

•

Article 10 (the right to freedom of expression); and

•

Article 11 (the right to peaceful assembly and the freedom of association with others).

Importantly, Article 14 declares:
The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured
without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political
or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth
or other status.

3.22

3.23

There is a defence of objective justification. ‘Other status’ could
include any category, eg sexual orientation, age, education or trade
union status. Article 14 does not give a free-standing right not to be
discriminated against in any sphere of employment. It only forbids
discrimination in areas covered by the other ECHR rights. The
Council of Europe has adopted Protocol 12 to the ECHR, which
does give a free-standing right against discrimination. Unfortunately,
past governments have been unwilling to sign and ratify the protocol
on grounds that it is ‘too general and open-ended’.
Many of the rights and fundamental freedoms under the ECHR are
qualified, ie have exceptions. For example, Articles 8–11 may be
subject to restrictions on a number of grounds ‘in accordance with
the law’ or ‘prescribed by law’ which are deemed ‘necessary in a
democratic society’, eg for public safety, for the protection of health
or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
There should be a fair balance between protecting individual rights
and the interests of the community at large. This is called the
principle of ‘proportionality’.36 Many cases have failed because of
the exceptions.
Article 6 has been used to challenge the conduct of court and
tribunal processes. This is because ‘public authorities’ are defined
to include courts and tribunals.37 Article 6 starts by saying:
In the determination of his civil rights and obligations … everyone is entitled to a fair and
public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established
by law.

3.24

3.25

Article 6 does not usually apply to internal disciplinary hearings,
though it may apply where the outcome may have a substantial
influence or effect on the determination in a second set of
proceedings of the worker’s right to practice his/her profession.38 In
such exceptional cases, it can be a basis for arguing there is a right to
legal representation at an internal disciplinary hearing. The UK rules
on state immunity preventing employees at diplomatic missions from
claiming in courts and tribunals may breach Article 6.39
Under Article 6, a worker may be able to challenge certain
tribunal procedures, eg an unreasonable refusal of a postponement40
or failing to make necessary adjustments to ensure disabled
claimants or those with language difficulties are able to give
evidence to the best of their ability. Article 6 has been used
successfully to challenge the appearance of bias where an
employer’s representative at an Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)
hearing was a part-time judge at the EAT. He had previously chaired
a panel where one of the current lay members had also sat as a lay
member.41
Article 8 is one of the most frequently called upon articles. Article
8(1) states:
Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his
correspondence.

This right is qualified by Article 8(2), which allows an exception if
it is ‘in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic
society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or
crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of
the rights and freedoms of others’. The right to respect for private
life includes sexual activity, eg the ECtHR said that the discharge of
lesbians and gay men from the armed forces and investigations into
their homosexuality were breaches of Article 8.42 However, where
an employee is dismissed for sexual activity in a public place, this
does not fall within Article 8 because it does not concern privacy.43
Even where Article 8 does apply, it may be a justified interference

3.26

3.27

with employees’ privacy to dismiss them if knowledge of their
sexual activities has become public and could impair their ability
effectively to carry out their duties.44 Article 8 has also proved
useful in connection with the rights of transgender people to legal
recognition of their gender reassignment.45 Where the employer
obtains evidence for an ET case by covert tape-recordings infringing
the worker’s right to privacy, Article 8 may clash with the right to
have all the evidence heard so as to have a fair trial under Article 6.
Similar issues arise where the worker does not want to disclose
private medical records. The ET will usually allow the evidence to
be used if needed for a fair trial.46 Considerations under Articles 6,
8 and 10, taken together are very relevant to whether a tribunal
should make an order restricting publicity in a sexual harassment or
similar cases.47
Article 9 is another important article, which frequently comes up
in relation to workers’ rights to express their private religious and
other beliefs, especially where this might clash with the rights of
others.48 Two high-profile cases in recent years were taken directly
to the ECtHR. In Eweida, the ECtHR supported a person’s right to
manifest his/her religion at work, provided such manifestation does
not clash with the rights and freedoms of others or public safety
interests.49 In Redfearn, the ECtHR decided that a worker who is
dismissed for belonging to a political party must have the right to
have the fairness of that dismissal assessed by an employment
tribunal regardless of his/her length of service.50 This led to
legislation removing the qualifying period for bringing unfair
dismissal claims regarding dismissal related to an employee’s
political opinion or affiliation.
It may be hard to challenge a dress code under Article 10, unless it
is extremely unreasonable.51 However, a code which discriminates
between men and women in relation to hair length or wearing
trousers may breach Article 10 taken together with Article 14.52
Article 11 is interesting because it covers the right to join trade
unions. In one case, UNISON unsuccessfully challenged restrictions
on the right to strike under UK law.53 There has been a more

successful case challenging inducements to workers to surrender
their right to union representation.54

Who can claim under the Human Rights Act 1998?
3.28

3.29

3.30

Under the HRA 1998, it is unlawful for public authorities to behave
in a manner contrary to the ECHR,55 except where a public authority
is forced to act a certain way because of an Act of Parliament.
Workers employed by obvious public authorities such as government
departments and local authorities should be able to enforce the
ECHR rights directly. Workers employed by bodies ‘some of whose
functions only are of a public nature’, eg Railtrack, the BBC or GP
practices which have both NHS and private patients, may not be able
to claim. This is because only the public functions of such mixed
bodies will be covered and the employment relationship may be seen
as a private function. A service contracted out by a local authority
may no longer be carrying out a public function.56
Workers employed exclusively in the private sector cannot enforce
ECHR rights directly. However, this is unlikely to make much
difference in most cases as courts and tribunals must interpret
domestic law consistently with the ECHR as far as possible. For
example, ETs should take account of any relevant ECHR rights when
deciding unfair dismissal claims. Also, claimants may be able to
challenge unfair court or tribunal processes under Article 6.57 ET
claimants should mention the HRA 1998 in their claim form if they
want to rely on it or have it taken into account.
A court can award damages against a public authority which will
be assessed in accordance with Article 41 of the ECHR.58

Employers are obliged to pay wages to workers who are
willing and able to work their contractual hours, even if the
workers are not required to do so. Some contracts have an
express term allowing the employer to lay off workers when
there is no work and without pay, but such a term is unusual
and can only be relied on for a short period of time.
Increasingly, different contract arrangements are made so that
employers are not obliged to offer paid hourly work on a
regular basis, eg casual work and zero hours contracts.
Employers are not allowed to make deductions from wages.
There are some exceptions – eg where there is a statutory
requirement to make deductions (tax and National Insurance),
where it is a term of the employment contract, or where the
worker has agreed in writing in advance to the deduction.
Any deduction made without such authority can be recovered
by claiming in the employment tribunal under Employment
Rights Act (ERA) 1996 Part II. This is known as a claim for an
‘unlawful’ or (more correctly) ‘unauthorised’ deduction from
wages.
The majority of workers are entitled to the national minimum
wage. Failure to pay the minimum wage will entitle the worker
to recover the shortfall at current rates. The employer will also
be committing a criminal offence and can be fined.
Workers on furlough are still entitled to their full contractual
pay unless they agree a reduction. However, they are not
entitled to the national minimum wage for unworked hours
except when undergoing approved training.
Under the Working Time Regulations (WTR) 1998, workers
are entitled to limits on the hours worked and rest breaks.
They are also entitled to four weeks’ paid annual leave plus
1.6 weeks’ additional annual leave in recognition of bank

holidays. Statutory holiday entitlement cannot be substituted
by a payment in lieu except on termination of employment.
There are special rules where the worker cannot take holiday
because s/he is sick, on maternity leave or the employer has
effectively prevented him/her from taking it. There are also
special carry over provisions where it is not reasonably
practical for the worker to take leave because of Covid-related
reasons.
When off sick, most workers are entitled to statutory sick pay
(SSP). They will not be entitled to full pay unless they have
such a right under their contract. Workers may also be entitled
to SSP if self-isolating because of Covid-19.
Workers are entitled to receive itemised pay statements
(usually payslips) at or before each pay day.

Introduction
4.1

4.2

The payment of wages, and the intervals at which payments are
made, is a matter of agreement between the employer and worker,
although there are some statutory restrictions. There must be no
discrimination because of sex1 or any other protected
characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, eg race. There is also a
national minimum wage.2
The employer is under a statutory duty to give employees a written
statement which includes the scale or the method of calculating
wages and the intervals at which wages will be paid, whether
weekly or monthly or some other period.3 The employer is also
obliged to give employees written itemised pay statements (usually

4.3

4.4

payslips) at or before the time of payment of wages.4 The pay
statements must set out the gross pay and all deductions made from it.
As well as this right to be notified of deductions made, there are
restrictions on what kind of deductions employers are allowed to
make from wages.5
It is a fundamental term of the employment contract to pay wages,
and deliberate failure to do so will entitle the employee to claim
constructive dismissal.6 Mere delay in payment due to unexpected
events, accounting mistakes or temporary faults in the employer’s
technology may not be a fundamental breach of contract unless
repeated or unexplained.7 It is also possible to sue for the wages
owing, either in the employment tribunal (ET) as an unauthorised
deduction from pay8 or as a breach of contract in the civil courts
(county court or High Court) or, if the contract has terminated, in the
ET.9
Unless the contract explicitly says otherwise, the employee is
generally entitled to be paid for his/her contractual hours as long as
s/he is ready and willing to work. This is so even if for some reason
the employer refuses to allow him/her to come in and work, eg due to
work shortage or disciplinary suspension. While the employer’s
obligation in most work situations is to pay the wages contractually
agreed, there is usually no obligation to supply work.10 The
employee’s obligation is to be willing and able to perform his/her
contractual duties. The failure to do so entitles the employer to
deduct a sum equal to the proportion of the time when the employee
was not willing to work.11 Increasingly, different contract
arrangements are made so that employers are not obliged to offer
paid hourly work on a regular basis, eg casual work and zero hours
contracts (see para 1.40 for more detail).

Workers
4.5

There are different eligibility requirements for different employment
rights. For example, to claim unfair dismissal, it is necessary to be
an ‘employee’ as defined by the Employment Rights Act (ERA)
1996. For other rights, it is only necessary to be a ‘worker’, which is

a much broader category. Nevertheless, when claims are made for
matters such as holiday pay, unauthorised deductions or the minimum
wage, claimants often find their first problem is to prove they were a
‘worker’. The definition of a worker is the same under the ERA
1996 (s230), the Working Time Regulations (WTR) 199812 (reg 2),
the National Minimum Wage Act (NMWA) 1998 (s54) and the Parttime Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment)
Regulations 200013 (reg 1). It reads as follows:
A ‘worker’ means an individual who has entered into or works under …
(a) a contract of employment, or
(b) any other contract, whether express or implied and (if it is express) whether oral or in
writing, whereby the individual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or
services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract
that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by
the individual.

4.6

Category (a) is therefore the conventional type of ‘employee’ who
can bring, for example, an unfair dismissal claim. Category (b) refers
to other types of worker. In the case-law, they are often referred to as
‘limb (b)’ workers. Shop workers and betting workers are separately
covered under ERA 1996, as are agency workers and home workers
under NMWA 1998.
A worker is different from someone who is truly self-employed.
Self-employed individuals can make their own choices as to what
work they do and when and where they do it. They work for
themselves. Although the practical realities of getting work mean
they must satisfy the (often quite stringent) requirements of those who
engage their services, ultimately the choices are their own to make.14
There are three key elements to the definition of a ‘worker’ in the
legislation: (1) there must be a contract between the individual and
the ‘employer’; (2) the individual must be required to work
‘personally’ for the employer; and (3) the individual must not be
working for someone who is in reality his/her client or customer. As
long as these apply, it does not matter that the individual is in
business on his/her own account.15 There are no absolute rules, but

4.7

often a useful distinction will be the difference between an
individual who markets his/her services to the world in general and
someone who works in a subordinate position in circumstances
where s/he is integrated into the employer’s business.16 Although
there are some borderline situations where it is difficult to know
whether or not a person is a worker, the effect of recent case-law is
that the definition should widely apply.17 It is particularly important
that the person is required to do the work ‘personally’. Therefore,
someone is unlikely to be a worker if s/he is completely free to send
along substitutes to work in his/her place. However, a limited power
of delegation does not necessarily mean that s/he is not a worker.18 It
will depend what kind of restrictions are imposed on the person’s
right to send substitutes. For example, depending on the facts,
someone can still be working ‘personally’ for the employer if s/he is
only allowed to arrange a substitute when s/he is unable (as opposed
to unwilling) to do the work, or if a substitute must be a work
colleague or can only be provided with the employer’s prior
approval.19 In general, when deciding whether someone is a worker,
it is important to consider the real position. Although any written
contract will be a relevant factor, it is not the starting point, as it may
not reflect the true agreement between the parties.20 All the evidence
should be considered. For example, the written contract may say that
a person can send along a substitute, but the person may have tried to
do so at some point and the employer may have objected.
The definition of ‘worker’ excludes people who carry on a
business or profession where the other party is a client. This would
exclude professionals such as solicitors, doctors and dentists, and
also sole traders and taxi drivers. There can be marginal situations
where the person is not in one of these obvious categories, yet is
working for more than one ‘employer’ at the same time. This does
not necessarily mean the person is treating the employer as a client.
A good indicator in many, but not all cases, is to consider the extent
to which the individual is integrated into the employer’s business.21
There are special rules regarding partners in solicitors’ firms or
members of a limited liability partnership (LLP).22 In a series of

high-profile cases over the last few years, private taxi drivers and
bicycle couriers have been found to be workers.23 However, every
employment arrangement will be considered on its own facts. The
case-law regarding who meets the extended definition of ‘employee’
under the Equality Act 2010 will also be relevant, as it is now
considered to have the same requirements as a ‘limb (b)’ worker
(see para 12.12).

Deductions from pay
The legal framework
4.8

The Wages Act 1986 repealed the Truck Acts which gave workers
the right to be paid in cash. It also set out certain protection against
deductions from wages. The Wages Act 1986 was repealed and reenacted in the ERA 1996 Part II. Part II of the ERA 1996 allows
employers, if they satisfy the necessary requirements, to make
deductions from the pay of workers. The definition of a ‘worker’, as
opposed to someone who is an employee or self-employed, is
discussed at paras 4.5–4.7 above. Part II also covers Crown
employment (civil servants), but not those employed in the armed
forces. Once a deduction is allowed, there is no restriction on its
amount unless the worker is employed in retailing. ERA 1996 s13
deals with the employer’s right to make deductions from a worker’s
wages. ERA 1996 s18 additionally limits the size of the deduction
that can be made from the wages of retail workers for cash shortages
and stock deficiencies.24 However, even the limited protection
afforded to retail workers is removed on their final pay day.25

Unauthorised deductions from wages
Definition of ‘wages’
4.9

For the purpose of ERA 1996 Part II, ‘wages’ are given a wide
definition, covering ‘any sums payable to the worker by his employer
in connection with his employment, including any fee, bonus,
commission, holiday pay or other emolument referable to his

4.10

employment’,26 including guarantee payments, SSP27 and statutory
maternity pay (SMP).28 The courts have held that wages do not
include notice pay (unless the worker is working out his/her notice
or is treated as doing so).29 Discretionary and ex gratia payments are
wages if there is a reasonable expectation that the worker will
receive the payment.30 The definition includes commission that
becomes payable after the termination of the worker’s contract,
provided that it is in connection with the employment.31
Certain payments are expressly excluded from the definition of
wages, eg loans and advances on wages, expenses including a car
mileage allowance,32 pensions, allowances or gratuities in
connection with the worker’s retirement, redundancy payments and
benefits in kind. Payment of pension contributions to a pension
provider is also not covered.33
When deductions can be made

4.11

ERA 1996 Part II prevents the employer from making any deduction
from the wages of workers unless it is:
1) authorised by statute.34 This enables the employer to deduct from wages the PAYE tax
and National Insurance payments as required by law or payments following a court order35
(maintenance payments, fines, etc);
2) authorised by a ‘relevant provision in the contract’. There is no requirement that the term
of the contract should be in writing, and the term in question can be an implied rather than
express term. However, it is necessary for the employer to have notified the worker in
writing of the existence of the term before making the deduction;36 or
3) previously agreed in writing by the worker that the deduction may be made.37

4.12

The worker’s consent to the contractual agreement or the deduction
cannot be retrospective, ie after the worker’s conduct or event
leading to the deduction.38 Where the written consent is to make
deductions in respect of stock shortages, it must have been given
before the shortage arose.39 The employer also cannot receive any
payment from the worker unless the payment satisfies one of the three
conditions above. This prevents the employer recovering payments
by demand rather than deduction.

Even if the above three conditions are absent, the employer is
entitled to deduct money:

4.13

•

for a statutory purpose to a public authority (eg taxes owing to Her Majesty’s Revenue &
Customs (HMRC));

•

as a consequence of a strike or industrial action;40

•

for any contractual obligation to pay to a third party (eg union dues);41

•

in satisfaction of a court or tribunal order requiring the worker to pay the employer, where
the worker has given prior written consent;42

•

if the deficiency in payment is attributable to an error of computation. However, a
conscious decision not to make a payment because the employer believes that there is a
contractual right not to make the payment does not amount to an error of computation;43

•

in respect of any overpayment of wages and/or expenses.44

Overpayments of wages
4.14

Unfortunately, there is a complete bar on bringing a claim for
unauthorised deductions where the employer’s reason for the
deduction is to recover an overpayment of wages.45 This is so even
if the employer has miscalculated how much the overpayment is, or
is not entitled to the money for other reasons.46 However, the ET
cannot just refuse to hear a claim on the employer’s assertion that the
deduction is for an overpayment. If the worker disputes there was an
overpayment, the ET must listen to the evidence and decide on the
facts whether it occurred. This is different from deciding whether the
employer was entitled to deduct the pay as a matter of contract,47 but
practically speaking, the ET may end up deciding the whole issue.
Assuming the ET refuses to hear the case because ERA 1996 Part II
does not apply, the worker must sue in the civil courts if s/he wants
to recover the deducted sum on grounds that the employer was never
entitled to it. Alternatively, if the sum is outstanding when his/her
employment ends and s/he is an employee, s/he can claim for breach
of contract in the employment tribunal.48 Either way, the worker’s
claim should be expressed as for his/her unpaid wages and not as for
the overpaid sum.

4.15

Very often, the worker accepts the sum was originally overpaid,
but has innocently spent the money. Whether the worker will be
successful in claiming breach of contract as mentioned above,
depends on the following principles. At common law, an employer
who overpays a worker by mistake (factual or legal)49 usually has a
good claim to restitution, and is bound to assert this when defending
the worker’s claim. However, this argument will fail if the worker
can prove ‘change of position’.50 The worker must prove that s/he
did not realise s/he had been overpaid. To see whether this is
credible, it is relevant to look at the size and pattern of the
overpayments, how recent they were and whether the payslips were
clear. It is also important to show the overpayment was not primarily
the worker’s fault, eg because s/he gave some misleading
information to the employer. Finally, the worker must show s/he has
changed his/her position in reliance on the money, eg made purchases
s/he would not normally have made. The older but similar argument
of estoppel (if still valid) may be more beneficial where the worker
changed his/her position only in respect of part of the overpayment.
The law in this area is complex and developing. The full legal
position should be checked, as the above represents only a general
summary.
What amounts to a deduction?

4.16

Where the total amount of any wages that are paid by an employer to
a worker is less than the total amount of the wages that are properly
payable to the worker on that occasion, the amount of the deficiency
will be treated as a deduction made by the employer from the
worker’s wages, even where there is a 100 per cent deduction.51 Any
unauthorised deduction from any of the different types of ‘wages’ or
a non-payment of them,52 such as the failure to pay SSP, SMP or
accrued holiday pay,53 is recoverable in the ET. However, if there is
an issue regarding entitlement to SSP and SMP, this is a matter for
HMRC rather than the ET.54
Retail workers

4.17

4.18

4.19

Those working in retail employment are given additional protection
regarding the amount of any deductions on account of cash or stock
deficiencies.55 This assumes the deductions are allowed at all under
the general rules above. During the worker’s employment, the
employer can deduct no more than ten per cent of the gross wage due
on any given pay day, and can only continue to recover up to ten per
cent in the following weeks until the full sum is recovered. In the
final week of employment any amount which remains outstanding can
be recovered by the employer.56 Deductions other than for cash or
stock shortages are not subject to this ten per cent ceiling.
Also, deductions for cash shortages or stock deficiencies may not
be made more than 12 months after the employer discovers, or ought
reasonably to have discovered, the shortage.57 This protection was
introduced because of the widespread practice of retail employers of
deducting cash and stock deficiencies from wages. The worst
employers were garage owners, who would hold workers
responsible for unpaid fuel bills which were often in excess of the
wages owing, resulting in the worker owing money to the employer
for the privilege of working!
Retail employment means employment which involves the carrying
out by the worker of retail transactions directly with members of the
public and the collection by the worker of amounts payable in
connection with retail transactions such as the sale and supply of
goods and services.58 This definition covers workers in shops,
banks, building societies, petrol stations, restaurants (waiters and
cashiers); homeworkers; those working on the ‘lump’ in the building
trade; and workers involved in the delivery and sale of produce,
such as those who do milk rounds.

Remedies and time limits
4.20

The worker can make a claim to the ET asking for a declaration that
the employer has made unauthorised deductions and an order that the
employer repay the sums deducted.59 To decide whether there has
been an unauthorised deduction, an ET will have to consider the
facts and, if necessary, decide what the contract meant.60 The ET

4.21

4.22

4.23

claim must be made within three months of the date of the deduction
or, if the worker has made a payment to the employer, of the date
when the payment was made.61 If a worker leaves and a deduction is
made from his/her final pay, the time can be counted from the date of
the final payslip or payment, even if that is sent some time after the
termination date.62 Even so, it is advisable to lodge the claim within
three months of the termination date.
The time limit runs from the latest date on which payment could be
made under the contract rather than an earlier date of actual
payment.63 So for example, if commission is due on 1 February but
usually paid on 20 January, and the worker wants to claim for an
underpayment, the three months runs from 1 February. Again, if given
the choice, the worker should play safe and count three months from
the earlier date.
If the employer made a series of deductions, the time limit runs
from the last deduction.64 In this situation, a claim could be made for
deductions going back more than three months, eg for an ongoing
reduction of wages which has not been agreed. The EAT has said that
there cannot be more than three months between each deduction in a
series, although the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal disagrees and
it is difficult to see how the wording of the legislation supports the
EAT’s view.65
The ET can extend the time limit if it was not reasonably
practicable for the claim to have been made within the three-month
period.66 The extension provision adopts the same form of words as
is used for the unfair dismissal provision and it can be assumed
therefore that the worker will experience the same problems with
ERA 1996 Part II claims as with unfair dismissal claims67 if the time
limit is missed. In addition to the above rules regarding time limits,
claims cannot be brought at all in respect of deductions made more
than two years before the ET1 is presented.68 There are limited
exceptions, eg in respect of deductions from SSP, SMP and guarantee
payments.69 The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service
(ACAS) early conciliation procedure applies to wages claims.70

4.24

4.25

Wages owed may be claimed either under ERA 1996 Part II as a
deduction, or as a breach of contract in the county court or High
Court (or Scottish equivalent) or, if the contract has been terminated
and the worker is an employee, in the ET. There may be advantages
in claiming under Part II even though it seems a more artificial
concept, eg because employers can launch their own contract claims
against an employee who has brought a contract claim, but not
against an employee who has brought a Part II unauthorised
deduction claim. Also, the employer may have a genuine entitlement
to the money, but not to acquire it by helping him/herself out of the
pay packet. If that happens and the worker wins his/her unauthorised
deductions claim, the employer loses the right to claim in respect of
the same sum in the county court or High Court.71 On the other hand,
time limits are shorter under Part II and claims cannot go back further
than two years, even for continuing deductions. Further differences
between the two venues, ie ET (unauthorised deductions claims) and
county court or High Court (breach of contract claims) are set out at
para 4.28 below.
There is an often forgotten entitlement whereby, if the tribunal
finds the claim for unauthorised deductions is well-founded, it can
order the employer to pay financial compensation for any further
financial loss attributable to that deduction.72

Employment tribunal claim for breach of contract
Introduction
4.26

Once an employee’s employment has ended, s/he can bring a claim in
the ET for breach of contract, eg for holiday pay, wages owing or
notice.73 The claim must arise or be outstanding on the termination of
employment, and not a result of later events, eg suing for breach of a
settlement agreement made some days after termination.74 It is not
possible to bring contract proceedings in the ET for compensation
arising out of personal injury sustained at work, or claims concerning
living accommodation or clauses in restraint of trade.75 There is a
three-month time limit from the end of employment for bringing an

ET contract claim unless it is not reasonably practicable to do so
within that period. Any claim then brought by the employer against
the employee must be made within six weeks of receipt of the
employee’s ET1. There is a maximum ceiling of £25,000 for a claim
in the ET.
Many claims, for example for wages owing (though not for pay in
lieu of notice), could alternatively be brought under ERA 1996 Part
II as an unauthorised deduction (see paras 4.20–4.23 regarding time
limits). For this, it is not necessary for the worker to be an employee.
Since, as we have said, the employer can bring his/her own contract
claim if an action is commenced by the employee for breach of
contract in the ET, an unauthorised deduction claim will be
preferable where there is a choice, except where there are time limit
problems.

4.27

The difference between employment tribunal and
county or High Court claims
These are some key respects in which a contract claim in the county
court or High Court differs procedurally from one in an ET:

4.28

•

Only an employee can bring a contract claim in the ET and only after his/her employment
has ended.

•

The time limit in the county court or High Court is normally six years from the breach,
whereas in the ET it must be brought within three months of termination, though in some
circumstances the cause of action may have arisen in the previous six years.76

•

The ACAS early conciliation procedure applies to a contract claim in the ET.77

•

There is no longer a fee for ET claims. There is a fee for running a county court claim (or
a sheriff court claim in Scotland), though the latest position should be checked.

•

Legal costs will only be awarded against an employee in the ET in limited circumstances,78
but in the county court or High Court costs will normally be awarded to the party who wins
(unless it is a case on the small claims track).

•

If an employee has a claim in excess of £25,000 and makes an ET claim which is capped
at £25,000, s/he cannot claim the balance in the county court or High Court because the
matter has already been litigated.79 S/he cannot get round this by expressly ‘reserving’
his/her right to go to the civil courts afterwards. If the employee realises s/he has made a

mistake and withdraws the tribunal claim before it is decided, s/he may be able to start
again in the civil courts, as long as the ET does not make an order dismissing the
withdrawn claim.80 The employee should be sure to ask the ET not to dismiss the claim on
withdrawal and explain why.

Furlough
The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was introduced on a
temporary basis in an attempt to keep employees employed during
the Covid-19 pandemic. The central idea was that the government
would subsidise most of the wages of employees who were not
working and placed on furlough. Public sector employers were
discouraged from using the Scheme. The basis for the Scheme was
set out in several Treasury Directions under powers granted by the
Coronavirus Act 2020. HMRC, which was responsible for running
the Scheme, issued regular and detailed guidance which
unfortunately differed from the Treasury Directions in several
respects. This made it difficult to understand the exact rules, which
were in any event hugely detailed and complicated, as well as
frequently changing.
The Scheme ran, with various permutations, from 1 March 2020 to
30 September 2021. For most of the period, employers were able to
claim a grant from the government of 80 per cent of a furloughed
employee’s pay, but at certain times, that was reduced to 70 per cent
and then 60 per cent subject to a cap of £2,500/month. Initially
furloughed employees were not allowed to work at all for their
employer, but from 1 July 2020 a flexible furlough scheme was
introduced, whereby employees could work part-time and be
furloughed for the remaining hours.
There are these key points to bear in mind:

4.29

4.30

4.31
•

There was no legal obligation on an employer to offer furlough to all or any of the
workforce, but failure to do so, or unfair selection, could have implications for unfair
dismissal and discrimination claims.

•

Conversely, workers could not be put on furlough unless they agreed. However, refusal to
agree might lead to a fair redundancy, depending on the circumstances of course.

•

Unless the worker agreed to a pay cut (or, unusually, there was a right in the contract to lay
off without pay), employers were still contractually obliged to pay workers their full wage,
even though they could only reclaim 80 per cent (or less) from the government. In practice,
there may be difficulty in proving whether a worker’s agreement to be furloughed included
an agreement, whether express or implied, to be paid only 80 per cent during the furlough
period.

•

There are complicated rules attempting to protect an employee’s right to receive notice pay
or redundancy pay etc based on his/her pre-furlough pay levels.81 These are discussed
further in the relevant chapters of this book, but full details are beyond the scope of this
book.

4.32

If bringing a claim for pay deductions made while on furlough, it may
be necessary to establish the exact furlough rules in place on the
relevant dates. As stated above, these varied over time as to the
percentage of pay which the employer could reclaim, and whether
the worker was allowed to work reduced hours for the employer.
This may not directly bear on the fundamental question which is
whether the worker agreed to a pay cut, but it may provide important
context.

National minimum wage
The legal framework
4.33

4.34

The NMWA 1998 introduced for the first time a national minimum
wage, although in the past there had been minimum pay for certain
vulnerable groups of workers.82 The law is set out in the NMWA
1998 and the National Minimum Wage Regulations (NMW Regs)
2015.83 The NMW Regs 2015 replaced the NMW Regs 1999 and
various amending regulations. The Department for Business, Energy
& Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has issued some useful guidance,
although it has no formal legal status.84
There is a Low Pay Commission which advises the government on
pay rates. Its reports and pay rates for many years are available on
its website.85 Many commentators feel that the minimum pay rates
are set too low and do not do enough to tackle poverty. By contrast,
the voluntary ‘living wage’ campaign in recent years has gradually

4.35

gathered strength, showing up the inadequacy of the statutory
minimum wage. In April 2016, the government introduced a socalled ‘national living wage’ for those aged 25 or over, thus
appropriating the name ‘living wage’ from the campaign. This still
fell below what is now called the ‘real living wage’. For example,
in April 2021, when the statutory minimum wage was only
£8.91/hour for those aged 23 and above, the real UK ‘living wage’
was assessed at £9.50/hour, and the London living wage at
£10.85/hour. Details of the real living wage, which is currently
revised every October/November, can be found on the website of the
Living Wage Foundation.86
The government plans to reduce the age qualification for the
statutory national living wage to those aged 21 and above by 2024. It
has also announced an aspiration to bring the hourly rate up to twothirds of median earnings, but whether this will be sustainable after
the Covid-19 pandemic remains to be seen. UNISON has made
regular submissions to the Low Pay Commission calling for the
national minimum wage to be brought up to the level of a ‘living
wage’.87 The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has also made
submissions in the past. The following paragraphs in this chapter
deal only with the statutory national minimum wage.

Who can claim
4.36

4.37

A person qualifies for the national minimum wage if s/he is a worker
over compulsory school age who works or ordinarily works in the
UK.88 The definition of a ‘worker’,89 as opposed to someone who is
an employee or self-employed, is discussed at paras 4.5–4.7 above.
Agency workers and home workers are explicitly covered by the
NMWA 1998.90
Excluded from an entitlement to a minimum wage are: workers
participating in certain government training or work experience
schemes; those on work schemes for provision of accommodation to
the homeless; those on certain European Union (EU) programmes;91
those on further education courses interrupted by work experience of
no more than one year;92 live-in au pairs and nannies and

companions who are treated as a member of their employer’s family
with free accommodation and meals;93 and members of the
employer’s family who live in his/her home.94

Method of calculation and the rates
The minimum wage is periodically increased. This used to take
place in October, but now occurs in April. Past rates can be found on
the GOV.UK website.95 For the year starting 1 April 2021:

4.38

•

the hourly rate for those aged 23+ (the so-called national living wage) was £8.91;

•

the hourly rate for those aged 21–22 was £8.36;96

•

the hourly rate for those aged 18–20 years was £6.56;97

•

the hourly rate for those under 18 years (and over compulsory school age98) was £4.62;99
and

•

4.39

the apprentice rate was £4.30 per hour.100

These are all gross sums.
The NMW Regs 2015 are complicated. They set out in detail how
to work out whether the minimum wage has been paid. The worker
must calculate the hourly rate s/he is actually paid for the relevant
pay reference period by dividing the total paid by the number of
hours worked.101 The pay reference period is a calendar month, or if
a worker is paid at shorter intervals, that shorter interval.102 If a
worker has earned pay in one reference period, eg for overtime or
commission, but it is not paid until the next, for calculation purposes
it is taken as paid in the initial period. There is an online calculator
for the national minimum wage at: worksmart.org.uk/tools/minimumwage-calculator.
How much has the worker been paid?

4.40

Unfortunately it is not as simple as looking at the worker’s payslip to
ascertain the total paid towards the minimum wage. There are all
sorts of payments, bonuses, perks and deductions, which make up a
pay packet. The NMW Regs 2015 set out which payments by the
employer may and may not be taken into account.103 The total paid

cannot include payments by the employer which represents amounts
paid by customers by way of service charge, tip, gratuity or cover
charge.104 The total does include performance allowances, but not
other allowances (unless consolidated into pay), eg attendance
allowances105 or reimbursement of expenses.106 Benefits in kind, eg
free meals or luncheon vouchers, cannot be counted towards the
employer’s payments.107 The value of free accommodation including
provision of related gas and electricity108 can only be counted to a
limited extent (known as the ‘accommodation offset’). In the year
starting 1 April 2021, this was £8.36/day.109 If it is a contractual
requirement to live in, and not a perk of the job, the value of free
accommodation may not be set off at all.110 Payments made to or
deductions by a local housing authority or registered social landlord
in respect of provision of accommodation are not deducted from the
total pay calculation except where the accommodation is provided in
connection with the worker’s employment with that authority or
landlord.111 Certain deductions made by employers are not counted
as deductions in the calculation of the total paid, eg deductions for
the repayment of loans or due to an accidental overpayment of
wages.112 Where the worker works overtime hours during the pay
reference period, payments above the basic rate for those hours are
not counted.113 So if the worker’s basic contractual rate is below the
minimum wage, it cannot be brought above the minimum wage just
because s/he regularly works overtime or receives other shift
premiums which mean s/he was actually paid above the minimum
overall.114 In the same way, a ‘salary premium’ for working at a
particular time, location or on particular responsibilities, also cannot
be counted into basic pay for a salaried worker.115
How many hours have been worked?
4.41

The number of hours which the worker has ‘worked’ during the pay
reference period may not be obvious, and it is important that the
correct type of work is identified, because it affects the calculation.
There are four types of work under the NMW Regs 2015: 1) time
work,116 2) salaried hours work,117 3) output work118 and 4)

4.42

4.43

4.44

unmeasured work.119 Time work is paid by reference to actual hours
worked. Salaried hours work is where a worker is entitled to be
paid for an ascertainable number of basic hours in a year by an
annual salary which is paid in instalments, usually weekly or
monthly; and where there is no entitlement to extra payment except
for any performance bonus or salary premium. Output work is where
pay is linked to output but not to time. Unmeasured work means any
other work, but particularly work where there are no specified hours
and the worker is required to work when needed or when work is
available.
Time on call – where a worker must be available at or near the
workplace – can be counted as hours ‘worked’ within time work or
salaried hours work (except when the worker lives there).120 For
example, a driver is waiting at the employer’s premises to start a
journey or a worker is called into a factory to help with an urgent
order, but there is a delay in the materials being delivered. Both must
be paid for their waiting time. However, if a duty solicitor is on call
at home, awaiting urgent calls from a police station, s/he need not be
paid while waiting at home.
There have been many conflicting cases over the years regarding
whether sleep-in workers are entitled to be paid the minimum wage
for each hour of their sleep-in shift, or only when they are up and
doing work tasks. The cases have tended to involve care workers in
residential homes and security guards, who are basically given
sleeping facilities, allowed to sleep, but expected to respond to
emergencies, requests for help, the telephone, and alarms.
The Supreme Court in the Royal Mencap case has now clarified
the position. Where an employer provides sleeping facilities, and the
main purpose of the shift is to sleep at or near the workplace, with
other tasks such as responding to a disturbance only being subsidiary,
the worker will not be taken to have worked for the entire shift. The
worker can only claim the minimum wage for the time when s/he is
awake for the purposes of working.121 It is not enough for workers to
be awake for their own purposes. They must be awake specifically
for the purpose of carrying out the tasks which the employer has

4.45

4.46

4.47

4.48

required them to do, such as answering emergency calls, helping
night staff when called on, or distributing breakfast. It is unlikely to
matter how often or how rarely the worker is disturbed in practice
(unless it is so often that the main purpose of the arrangement is not
in fact sleeping). It also does not matter that the worker has been
asked to sleep on the premises because of regulatory requirements.
If on the other hand, sleeping is not the main purpose of the
arrangement, the fact that the worker is allowed to nap between tasks
does not necessarily mean s/he is a sleep-in worker. S/he may on the
facts be ‘working’ throughout the shift and entitled to the minimum
wage for all the hours. The Supreme Court in Royal Mencap was
anxious to stress that it had not considered the type of home-working
arrangements which might arise because of Covid-19 restrictions.
Time on a rest break is not counted as time at work.122 Travelling
for work duties, though not to and from work, is usually counted as
working hours.123 Where required or approved by the employer and
taking place during the working day, time spent training and
travelling between the workplace and the training venue is generally
treated as hours worked.124
Output and unmeasured work can cause particular difficulties in
assessing the number of hours worked. The rules on calculating
output work are especially complex.125 Unmeasured work is either
paid for as the total number of hours worked or by reference to a
‘daily average’ agreement.126 This is a written agreement between
the worker and the employer made before the pay reference period. It
determines the average daily number of hours the worker is likely to
spend carrying out his/her contractual duties on days when s/he is
available to carry out those duties for the full amount of time
contemplated by the contract. It must be a realistic average.
In some cases it may not be clear whether a worker is doing time
work or unmeasured work. This can make a big difference to how
many hours should be paid for. Unmeasured work probably covers
situations such as those where residential care workers sleep on the
employer’s premises and are on call around the clock, but may be
only actively working for a few hours.127

4.49

A worker will not usually be entitled to the minimum wage while
on furlough for periods that s/he was not working.128 However, s/he
must be paid for hours where s/he is required to undertake
training.129

Enforcement
4.50

4.51

4.52

Employers must keep sufficient records to show whether they are
paying the national minimum wage.130 A worker who has reasonable
grounds to suspect that s/he has been underpaid has the right to
inspect and copy his/her own records.131 S/he must give his/her
employer a ‘production notice’ requesting production of the relevant
records for a specified period and stating whether s/he intends to
bring someone with him/her. The employer must then produce the
records on reasonable notice at the workplace or at another
reasonable location, within 14 days.
A worker who is paid less than the minimum wage can claim for
an ‘unauthorised deduction’ in the ET132 or ‘breach of contract of
employment’ in the county court or High Court (or Scottish
equivalent). The worker can claim arrears calculated at the minimum
wage rates applicable at the time the arrears are determined if these
are higher than those applicable at the time the underpayment
occurred.133 If an employer suddenly tries to reduce one part of a
worker’s contractual pay package, eg attendance allowances, to
subsidise an increase in the basic hourly rate, this would be an
unauthorised deduction from pay even if the overall pay package
remained the same.134
As well as individuals taking cases, enforcement can be carried
out by HMRC. HMRC officers have power to enter premises,
inspect records, interview employers and pass information onto
workers. They can issue a ‘notice of underpayment’ if they find
underpayment, requiring the employer to pay the arrears within 28
days.135 Officers must at the same time also serve a penalty notice
imposing a fine of 100 per cent of the total due subject to a minimum
of £100 and maximum of £20,000 per worker.136 The penalty is

4.53

4.54

halved if the employer pays the arrears within 14 days. Employers
can appeal against the notice of underpayment or the penalty notice to
an ET.137 If the employer does not comply with a valid notice, the
officer may on behalf of the worker present an ET claim for
unauthorised deductions or a claim for breach of contract in the civil
courts.138 To register a complaint with HMRC, a form needs to be
completed online.139 There is a ‘name and shame’ scheme whereby
employers who have been issued with a notice of underpayment are
named in a press notice unless certain exceptions apply. The scheme
was paused for a review in 2018 and restarted in 2020 for
employers owing more than £500. A press release in August 2021
named 191 companies for the period 2011–2018.140 Of named
employers, 47 per cent wrongly deducted pay, eg for uniform and
expenses, and 30 per cent failed to pay all time worked, eg when
workers did overtime. For details of the enforcement policy
generally, BEIS’s Minimum Wage Law: enforcement (2020).141
It is also a criminal offence not to pay the national minimum wage
or not to keep or preserve the prescribed records or to make false
records.142
A worker must not be subjected to a detriment including dismissal
because s/he is about to qualify for the minimum wage or because
s/he takes any action or any action is taken on his/her behalf to
secure the minimum wage.143 If an employee is dismissed, it will be
treated as automatically unfair dismissal regardless of his/her length
of service.144 HMRC has no power to assist workers with this type
of claim.

Holiday pay
4.55

The Working Time Regulations (WTR) 1998145 set minimum holiday
entitlements for most workers,146 but it is possible for workers to
agree greater holiday entitlements with their employers and these
become a contractual right. The worker can take whichever is more
favourable in each respect of his/her holiday rights under the contract
or WTR 1998.147 The worker’s holiday entitlement must be set out in

writing in his/her contract or statement of particulars.148 See para
4.87 onwards for the general position on holidays including under
the WTR 1998.

Sick pay
Introduction
4.56

The position regarding sick pay entitlement should be in writing, as it
is one of the terms and conditions which must be provided in a
written contract or statement of particulars.149 Regardless of the
contractual position, if an employee is leaving, and off sick during
his/her statutory notice period, s/he must usually be paid full pay for
that period.150 In 2010, the old system of ‘sick notes’ was replaced
by ‘fit notes’ whereby GPs in England, Scotland and Wales must
issue a ‘Statement of fitness for work’. Revised guidance for GPs,
employers and employees on fit notes was issued in December
2016.151 The emphasis is on encouraging everyone involved to think
about what adjustments could be made to enable workers to return to
work, rather than getting drawn into prolonged sick leave.

Statutory sick pay
4.57

4.58

Employees152 are entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) from their
employers for a period of up to 28 weeks’ sickness absence.
Employees on fixed-term contracts are included. Some employees
are specifically excluded, including those earning below the lower
earnings limit, ie normal (average) gross earnings below £120 per
week (for the year starting 6 April 2021).
The employee must be incapable of doing his/her work due to a
specific disease or bodily or mental disablement, or certified as a
carrier of an infectious disease.153 S/he must have been incapable of
work for at least four consecutive days (including days s/he does not
normally work). Two periods can be linked together if separated by
no more than eight weeks. S/he should be paid for each qualifying
day, ie a day on which s/he is contractually required to work but is

4.59

4.60

4.61

4.62

off sick. However, the first three qualifying days (known as ‘waiting
days’) are unpaid. If s/he is off sick within eight weeks of an earlier
period, s/he need not serve the three waiting days again. The
entitlement ceases if his/her job comes to an end, although not if the
employer dismissed him/her to avoid paying SSP.
At the time of writing, a person may be entitled to get SSP for
every day off work if they are self-isolating because they or someone
they live with or in their support bubble has Covid-19 symptoms, or
because they have been notified by the authorities that they have been
in contact with someone with Covid-19, or because they have been
advised to self-isolate prior to surgery. It does not cover having to
self-isolate purely after entering or returning to the UK. This position
is likely to change at some point.154
SSP is paid at a flat weekly rate – £96.35 is the standard weekly
rate for the year beginning 6 April 2021.155 The daily rate is
calculated by dividing the weekly rate by the number of qualifying
days in a week. SSP is usually paid through the pay packet in the
same way as normal wages.
Employers can decide how and when they want their employees to
notify them of sickness. For entitlement to contractual sick pay, the
employers can, within reason, impose any rule they like. For the SSP
element, however, they cannot insist that they are notified personally
by the employee, as opposed to by a friend or relative. They cannot
insist on being contacted more than once a week. Nor can they insist
on a medical certificate for the first seven days. For the initial sevenday period, employees must be allowed to self-certify.
If employers refuse SSP or intend to stop paying it, they should
give a written statement (usually on an SSP1 form) explaining why.
Workers who are ineligible for SSP or whose SSP runs out may be
able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) instead,
which depends on a different set of rules. They may also have an
independent entitlement to contractual sick pay. Employees can claim
unpaid SSP as an unauthorised deduction from wages under ERA
1996 Part II.156 If the employer disputes the employee’s entitlement

4.63

to SSP or its amount, a ruling should first be obtained from
HMRC.157
SSP and other benefits are not within the scope of this book and
the above is only a broad outline. Where the issue arises, specialist
advice should be sought. There are full details of the SSP rates, the
entitlement provisions and the remedies available for non-payment in
the excellent Welfare benefits and tax credits handbook, which is
published annually by the Child Poverty Action Group. The GOV.UK
website has useful guidance aimed at employers on how to calculate
SSP and the latest rates.158

Contractual sick pay
4.64

4.65

4.66

The SSP provisions are a minimum entitlement when away from
work on account of sickness. Many employees are covered by a
contractual sick pay scheme which generally makes up the difference
between the SSP figure and normal wages for a fixed period of time
in any given year. The first three days of sickness are usually also
covered. A contractual scheme may have various notification
requirements which it is important for the employee to follow, even
if some of these will not be valid for the SSP element (see above).
A contractual sickness procedure is normally set out in writing in
the contract of employment. If it is not in writing and was never
expressly agreed, it may still be possible to imply a term that the
employee is entitled to normal pay for a certain amount of time, eg if
the employee has been fully paid in previous years or if all other
staff are paid normally when off sick.159 In the absence of any
express term or this kind of implied term, there is no presumption
that employees are entitled to the normal rate of pay when off sick.160
If an employee’s contract says payment for sickness absence is
conditional on management being satisfied the sickness absence is
genuine, it is for the employer to make the decision as long as it is in
good faith and not perverse. The employer cannot just decide the
absence is not genuine without any specific evidence to that effect
and merely because the employer’s occupational health service
disagrees with the employee’s GP as to when the employee will be

fit to return.161 On the other hand, if an employer refuses to allow an
employee to return to work once the employee is certified as fit by
his/her own doctor, s/he must be paid full wages while remaining at
home unless the contract says otherwise.162

Itemised pay statements
4.67

4.68

4.69

Employers are obliged to provide employees with an itemised pay
statement at or before each pay day.163 There is no requirement on
the employee to request an itemised pay statement. It is an absolute
right.164 Itemised pay statements must include the gross pay, details
of all deductions from the gross pay, and the net pay. If the net pay is
paid in different ways, the amount and method of payment of each
part of the net pay must also be itemised.165 Where pay varies by
reference to time worked, the statement must include the number of
hours carried out.166 If the employer supplies the employee with a
written statement of a fixed deduction to be made each pay day (such
as the repayment of a season ticket loan), the employer need detail
the nature of this deduction only once every 12 months.167
If the employer fails to give an employee an itemised pay
statement, or if deductions are made which were not notified, the
employee can apply to the ET for a declaration to this effect,168 and
ask the ET to exercise its discretion to make a compensatory award.
The declaration is mandatory, but the compensation award is
discretionary. The maximum amount of compensation that can be
awarded is calculated by taking the date of application to the ET and
determining the amount of the unnotified deductions (tax, National
Insurance, union subscriptions, etc) on each of the pay days in the 13
weeks prior to the ET application.169 The ACAS early conciliation
procedure applies.170
If the reason why the employer has failed to provide itemised pay
statements is due to fraud or dishonest conduct, it is likely that the ET
will be more willing to make a high award. The compensation is
intended to act as a penalty on the employer for non-compliance and
it does not matter whether the employer has accounted for the sums

4.70

deducted to HMRC and therefore ends up paying twice.171 The
Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT), in a decision in 1979, allowed
a low ET award because the provisions had come into effect only
recently and the employer was a busy professional person in sole
practice.172 Twenty years later, the EAT took a stronger position173
and it is now unusual for employers to get away with such leniency.
It is important to stress to the ET that the failure to supply these
statements is often indicative of some unlawful practice by an
employer: usually the failure to make the appropriate tax and
National Insurance returns. It can also cause the employee practical
inconvenience.
Employees who do not get itemised pay statements should check
with HMRC to discover whether the employer has been committing a
fraud by not paying the requisite tax or National Insurance. If the
employer deducted National Insurance contributions but did not pass
these on to HMRC, the employee is treated as if the contributions
have been paid unless the employee agreed or was negligent.174

Working Time Regulations 1998
The legal framework
4.71

4.72

The WTR 1998175 came into force on 1 October 1998 in order to
implement European Community (EC) directives on the organisation
of working time176 and protection of young workers.177 Apart from
opting out of the 48-hour week (see below), it is not possible for
individuals to contract out of WTR 1998 rights.178 However,
collective or workforce agreements can modify or exclude certain
entitlements as set out below. WTR 1998 Sch 1 sets out specific
requirements for an agreement to become a workforce agreement.
‘Working time’ under the WTR 1998 means any period during
which the worker is working, at his/her employer’s disposal and
carrying out his/her duties plus any period during which s/he is
receiving relevant training.179 It includes overtime, working lunches
and travel on the job. Travel to and from work is not covered, unless
the worker has no fixed or habitual place of work; in that case, travel

from home to the first customer appointment and back home from the
last customer appointment is likely to be working time.180 This kind
of scenario may well apply to care workers who spend the day going
from appointment to appointment arranged by their employer.
Whether a worker is entitled to be paid for such time is an untested
question, but arguably that might be implied under the contract.181
Time while the worker is on call at or near the workplace, although
not at home, is all working time even if the worker can sleep during
periods of inactivity; but if the worker need not attend the workplace
and merely needs to be contactable at all times, then working time is
usually only for the periods when the worker is actually doing work
for the employer.182 However, there are situations where the
restriction on the worker’s freedom to engage in other activities
means that it is all working time.

Who is covered?
4.73

4.74

The WTR 1998 give rights to ‘workers’. The definition of a
‘worker’, as opposed to someone who is an employee or selfemployed, is discussed at paras 4.5–4.7 above. Temporary and
agency workers are also covered by the WTR 1998.183 ‘Young
workers’, ie those over compulsory school age184 but under 18, are
also covered, sometimes with greater protections.
Certain categories of seafarers, sea fishermen and workers on
vessels in inland waterways are excluded from the WTR 1998.185
Mobile staff in civil aviation are excluded from virtually all the
WTR 1998 rights except young worker protection.186 The Civil
Aviation (Working Time) Regulations 2004 apply instead.187
Workers performing mobile road transport activities are excluded
from the limits on working hours and night work and from the
entitlements to daily and weekly rest periods and daily rest
breaks.188 However, the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations
2005189 lay down a 60-hour maximum working week with an
average 48 hours over the reference period, plus minimum breaks
and rest periods, for certain mobile road workers, including drivers

4.75

4.76

and crew. The rules for who are covered are complex. For any other
mobile workers than those described above, there are exclusions on
the rest periods and breaks and regarding the length of night
working.190 These other ‘mobile workers’ are defined under reg 2 as
members of travelling or flying personnel by an undertaking which
operates transport services for passengers or goods by road or air.
Rail workers are not covered by these general exclusions, but they
are excluded in certain specific circumstances under reg 21 as
mentioned below. Non-mobile transport workers are now generally
covered. The reason for the various exclusions is that in most cases
they are covered by sector-specific EU directives and have their
own domestic legislation, which is similar. For further detail, see
WTR 1998 reg 18.191 There are also additional rules covering
workers on cross-border rail services, eg through the Channel
Tunnel.
Domestic servants in private households are excluded from much
of the protection, although the entitlement to holidays and rest breaks
remains.192
Almost all the protections in the WTR 1998, except for annual
leave, do not apply where the worker works on ‘unmeasured
working time’.193 It is unclear exactly what ‘unmeasured time’
means. The exception is intended to apply where, due to the specific
nature of the work done, the duration of the worker’s working time is
not measured or predetermined, or it can be determined by the
worker him/herself. The WTR 1998 give examples as managing
executives or other persons with autonomous decision-making
powers; family workers; or workers officiating in religious
ceremonies. The problem is that in many workplaces, there are
unspoken expectations or hidden pressures to work extra hours. The
exception should not apply if someone works extra hours because of
an excessive workload and unrealistic deadlines, or because his/her
colleagues habitually work long hours and s/he feels this is what the
employer expects. Some employers have attempted to interpret this
exception widely, but advisers should question this. High-powered,
self-regulating managing directors should probably be covered, but

not junior workers who are pressurised by higher management to
work limitless unpaid overtime.

The 48-hour week
4.77

4.78

WTR 1998 reg 4(1) imposes a contractual obligation on the
employer not to require a worker to work more than an average of 48
hours per week including overtime.194 The employer also has a duty
subject to criminal sanctions to take all reasonable steps to ensure no
more than 48 hours per week are worked unless the worker has
opted out (see below).195 The 48 hours is usually averaged over 17
weeks, although for some workers it will be 26 weeks.196 A
collective or workforce agreement cannot modify or exclude the 48hour ceiling, but in certain circumstances it can extend the period
over which hours are averaged.197 Certain days off are excluded
from the calculation of hours worked over the reference period, eg
days off sick, on maternity, paternity, adoption or parental leave, or
taken as part of the first four weeks’ annual leave.198
A worker can make a written agreement with his/her employer to
exclude (ie ‘opt out’ of) the 48-hour limit either for a specified
period or indefinitely.199 The worker is entitled to end the agreement
without the employer’s consent on seven days’ written notice or any
longer notice period specified in the agreement, but no longer than
three months.200 If the worker is dismissed or suffers a detriment for
refusing to enter into such an opt-out agreement or for bringing one to
an end, s/he can bring a claim to the ET.201 However, if an employer
refuses to allow a worker who has not opted-out to work occasional
voluntary overtime, this is not necessarily an unlawful detriment. It
depends whether the employer was taking reasonable steps to
comply with his/her duty to ensure a worker who had not opted-out
did not work more than 48 hours.202 For an opt-out to be valid, the
worker must have expressly and freely consented to work longer
hours.203 Given the inequality of bargaining power, it is doubtful
whether the common practice of presenting a worker with an opt-out
form to sign on his/her induction leads to free consent.

4.79

4.80

If a worker who has been working more than 48 hours decides to
exercise the opt-out and reduce his/her hours to 48, an employer can
probably reduce his/her pay proportionally, especially if pay is
explicitly linked to hours worked.204
Young workers generally must not work more than eight hours each
day and 40 hours per week.205

Night workers
4.81

Broadly speaking, a night worker is someone who works at least
three hours between 11pm and 6am on most working days.206 Night
workers must not work on average more than eight hours in each 24hour period, averaged over 17 weeks.207 If the work involves
special hazards or heavy mental or physical strain, there is an
absolute limit of eight hours in any 24-hour period. There are
exceptions to this protection for certain types of job.208 A collective
or workforce agreement can modify or exclude these limits.209 A
worker who is put onto night work must be given the opportunity of a
free health assessment before starting such work and at regular
intervals thereafter.210 If a registered medical practitioner advises
that a worker is suffering from health problems connected with night
work, the employer must transfer the worker to suitable work not at
night if that is possible. Young workers must not work between 10pm
and 6am or 11pm and 7am except in certain sectors.211 Mobile
workers, if covered at all,212 are excluded from the night work limits
but must have adequate rest.213

Rest periods
Overview
4.82

Employers must allow workers to take certain breaks during their
working hours. Some mobile workers (if covered at all) are
excluded from the normal rest break entitlements but they must be
given adequate rest.214

4.83

4.84

Workers are entitled to a minimum daily rest period of 11
consecutive hours.215 There are special rules for young workers.
Workers are also entitled to a weekly rest period of at least 24
consecutive hours in any given week, which may be given as two 24hour breaks or one 48-hour break over a fortnight.216 There are
special rules for young workers.
During the day, workers whose working time is more than six
hours are entitled to a rest break of 20 minutes without any
interruption and away from the work station.217 This means one rest
break in the working day, not a break every six hours.218 There are
special rules for young workers. A period of ‘downtime’, where the
worker need not work but must remain in radio contact and at the
employer’s disposal, is not a rest break. Nor can it retrospectively
be designated a rest break just because the employer happened not to
call on the worker.219 There is nothing to say when during the day
this break must be given, but as a matter of logic it should be taken
during the day and not tagged on to its start or end.220 It is not enough
that the employer allows rest breaks if requested by workers. The
employer must take active steps to ensure the working arrangements
enable workers to take the break. The failure to do so may amount to
a ‘refusal’ to allow the break.221 However, this is more a question of
not making it impossible to take breaks, as opposed to any obligation
to check workers actually take the breaks, let alone an obligation to
insist that they do so. There is no requirement under the WTR 1998
that the break must be paid, but there may be an entitlement for paid
breaks under the worker’s own contract. An employer cannot
suddenly insert a break during normal paid working hours and deduct
pay for that period. There is also a little tested entitlement to
‘adequate’ rest breaks where the worker’s health and safety is put at
risk because of the working pattern, in particular because the work is
monotonous or the work-rate pre-determined.222
Exceptions

4.85

Certain exceptions exist:

•

Shift workers or workers engaged in activities involving periods of work split up over the
day, eg cleaning staff, do not have the entitlement to daily and weekly rest periods, although
they are entitled to a period of compensatory rest where possible.223

•

The entitlements to daily and weekly rest periods and to rest breaks during the day as well
as the restrictions on the length of night working224 do not apply:
–

In special areas where continuity of service or production by the worker (as opposed
to the employer) may be necessary,225 eg work in hospitals, prisons, security guards,
caretakers, media, gas, water and electricity, urban transport services or refuse
collection; or where there is a foreseeable surge of activity, eg in tourism or postal
services.226 A ‘surge’ means an exceptional level of activity beyond the fluctuations
experienced within a working day or week.227

–

To workers on board trains or whose work affects train traffic or timetables.228

-

Where there have been unusual and unforeseeable circumstances or exceptional
events whose consequences are unavoidable.229

•

In all these circumstances, the worker should be given an equivalent period of
compensatory rest. Compensatory rest must be as near in quality, character and value as
the standard type of break as possible.230 Depending on the circumstances, it could for
example be the same as a standard break in all respects except that the worker is
technically ‘on call’, provided his/her services are rarely called upon at that time; or when
working a double shift, s/he could be given an uninterrupted double break in the second
shift. It does not have to be a single continuous 20-minute break provided the total rest has
the same value to the worker in terms of contributing to his/her well-being. It could for
example be two interrupted breaks of 15 minutes, one-third and two-thirds through a
shift.231 The fact that an employer may need to provide a continuous service, eg provision
of a security guard, does not mean that it has to be the same worker who is present
throughout – someone else could cover on breaks.232

•

In exceptional cases, where it is not possible to provide compensatory rest, the employer
must afford sufficient protection to safeguard the worker’s health and safety.233 The type
of protective measures might be several ten-minute breaks or other steps which are not
breaks at all, eg health checks for workers, risk assessments, or rearranging the way work
is carried out.234

•

Under WTR 1998 reg 24A, mobile workers235 are entitled only to adequate rest, ie regular
rest periods which are sufficiently long and continuous to ensure they don’t damage their
health or cause injury to themselves or others.236

4.86

An individual worker cannot opt out of his/her entitlement to rest
periods and breaks. However, a collective or workforce agreement
can modify or exclude these entitlements provided an equivalent
period of compensatory rest is given.237

Annual leave and bank holidays
Introduction
4.87

The WTR 1998 give workers the right to minimum paid annual leave
of 5.6 weeks. For someone working five days per week, this
translates into 28 working days’ leave. It would be higher for
someone working a six-day week, but there is a total overall cap on
the statutory entitlement of 28 days.238 A worker may have a greater
contractual entitlement. The Working Time Directive (WTD) only
requires workers to be given four weeks’ leave, and this is the
period which was originally contained in the WTR 1998.239 The 1.6
weeks’ ‘additional annual leave’ are not in the WTD, but were
phased into the WTR 1998240 from 1 October 2007 to 1 April 2009
in recognition of the eight public and bank holidays (though there
happen to be nine in Scotland). There is no right to take the extra
eight days on the public/bank holidays in question, nor to get paid
extra if required to work on those days, unless the worker has such a
right (express or implied, eg by custom and practice) under his/her
own contract. The law for such a basic right as holidays has become
ridiculously complicated, with many difficulties arising on issues
such as whether untaken holidays can be carried over, what happens
if a worker is unaware of his/her statutory entitlement and what if
s/he is on long-term sick leave. Test cases continue to be run on
various factual permutations and many questions remain unanswered.
Strangely, because the first four weeks leave are required by the
WTD and the additional 1.6 weeks are not, there are situations
where the value of the first four weeks’ holiday is greater than that of
the balance. This is explained further below where it arises.
The nature of the entitlement

4.88

4.89

Leave entitlement is usually calculated in days or fractions of a day.
For example, a worker who works a five-day week is entitled to 28
days’ paid leave per year (5 × 5.6); a part-timer who works three
days each week is entitled to 16.8 days’ paid leave per year (3 ×
5.6). If the worker works irregular hours or shifts, the calculation
will probably be based on the average number of hours/days worked
each week. The position with zero hours contracts is unclear, but
possibly a calculation would be based on the average of hours
previously worked.241 There is no longer a provision for rounding up
the leave entitlement if it does not work out as exact days. Where a
worker changes from full-time to part-time during the year, or vice
versa, his/her holiday accrues at the relevant rate for each period.
For example, if s/he worked six months on a five-day week and six
months on a three-day week, her holiday entitlement for the year
would be 14 days (5.6 × 5 divided by 2) + 8.4 days (5.6 × 3 divided
by 2) = 22.4 days.242 If there is no collective or workforce agreement
setting the dates of the holiday year and no written agreement
between the employer and worker on this point, the leave year for
workers employed before 1 October 1998 starts on 1 October; and
for other workers, on the anniversary of the start of their
employment.243 In the worker’s first year, s/he can only take holiday
which s/he has accrued, in this case (confusingly) rounded up to the
nearest half day.244 For example, a worker works five days per
week, so his/her holiday entitlement is 28 days (5.6 weeks) per year.
After 16 weeks, s/he can take nine days’ holiday. This is calculated
as follows: (16 divided by 52) × 28 = 8.61, which is then rounded
up to 9. In subsequent years, the worker need not wait until s/he has
accrued leave entitlement. Calculations of holiday pay are
potentially complicated. If you want to avoid the maths, GOV.UK
provides an online calculator.245
Leave must be taken in the leave year in which it is due and this
entitlement cannot be substituted by payment in lieu of the holiday
except on the termination of employment for the portion of the
termination year which has been worked.246 Under the WTR 1998,
untaken holidays cannot be carried over, although the worker may

4.90

have a contractual entitlement to do this. It is also permitted to carry
over some or all of the additional 1.6 weeks’ leave to the next
holiday year if the employer agrees in a relevant agreement, eg in a
collective agreement or the worker’s written contract.247 With this
small exception, untaken leave is therefore lost. There is a danger
that a worker will be strung along with the employer continually
refusing his/her proposed holiday dates until time runs out. Workers
in this position should give formal notice in good time to take leave
under the WTR 1998.248 See below for whether workers can claim
compensation where they did not try to take holidays or tried and
were refused. Also see para 4.109 regarding temporary additional
rights to carry over leave because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Unfortunately there is nothing in the WTR 1998 which prevents
employers specifying when in the year the leave must or must not be
taken, or how many days at a time, although the worker may have
greater rights under his/her contract. For example, an employer can
insist that holidays are taken at an annual Christmas shutdown unless
the contract indicates otherwise. The employer must give sufficient
notice specifying when the leave must be taken. The notice need not
be given in writing. Such notice must be given at least twice as many
days in advance of the earliest leave day as the number of days to
which the notice relates,249 eg an employer requiring a worker to
take two weeks’ holiday at Christmas must give at least four weeks’
notice. An employer can require a worker to take his/her holidays
during periods when s/he is not working anyway, eg teachers during
school holidays.250 In one case, where oil rig workers worked two
weeks offshore followed by two weeks onshore without work
obligations, the Supreme Court said the employer could designate
part of the two weeks off as annual leave.251 The important point was
that the workers had whole weeks where they were not required to
work and which they could take as holidays. This was not the same
as requiring a worker to take leave on his/her normal days off or a
part-time worker to take his/her leave on the days of the week when
s/he does not work.

4.91

4.92

4.93

A worker can take leave by giving the correct notice specifying the
proposed leave days.252 It is safer to give such notice in writing,
although this is not required under the WTR 1998. The notice must
be given twice as many days in advance of the first day proposed for
leave as the number of days proposed in total.253 If the employer
objects to leave being taken on those dates, s/he must give counternotice as many days in advance of the earliest date as the total
number of days to which the worker’s notice relates.254 For example,
a worker wanting to take three days’ leave must give at least six
days’ notice. Employers wishing to refuse that leave must give at
least three days’ counter-notice. Note that workers and employers
may have agreed a different notification procedure by a relevant
agreement under the rules, eg in a collective agreement or the
worker’s written contract of employment.255 This can include setting
annual holiday dates in the contract or including a contractual term
saying an employee who is leaving can be required to take holidays
during his/her notice period.256 Under the WTR 1998, the employer
does not need to have a good reason for refusing leave at any
particular time.257
Employers cannot unilaterally reduce a worker’s pay in order to
pay for holidays under the WTR 1998.258 The practice of ‘rolled-up’
holiday pay is also unlawful, ie simply increasing the basic wage to
cover holiday pay, but not making any payment at the time holiday is
taken.259 Having said that, an employer may set off any sums actually
paid in advance under transparent and comprehensive
arrangements.260 This effectively allows rolled-up payments by the
back door.
On the termination of employment, a worker is entitled to receive
payment for any untaken holiday in the holiday year of termination,
calculated proportionally to the leave year.261 This applies even if
s/he has been absent on sick leave all year up to the point of
leaving.262 As explained below, a worker may in very limited
circumstances be entitled to pay for untaken holiday in previous
years, even if s/he did not ask to carry over his/her holiday at the

time. To calculate the amount of leave due on termination in respect
of the current leave year, there is a formula in the WTR 1998:
(A × B) – C263
where:
A is the number of days annual leave to which the worker is entitled,
B is the proportion of the leave year which has expired at the
termination date, and
C is the amount of leave already taken that year.

4.94

4.95

For example, a worker who works five days each week has a 28-day
annual leave entitlement. If s/he leaves nine months into the final
holiday year, having taken six days paid leave that year, s/he is owed
((28 × 9/12) – 6) = 15 days. Alternatively, the WTR 1998 say that if
the worker’s contract (or other relevant agreement) specifies the sum
which the worker should be paid on leaving in respect of untaken
holiday, ‘such sum’ will apply instead of the statutory formula.264
This cannot mean no payment at all, so eg a contractual term
excluding all payment for untaken holidays if the dismissal is for
misconduct will not apply.265 It is also unlikely that a purely nominal
sum would be allowed.266 In respect of any contractual holiday
entitlement over and above the 5.6 weeks, pay in lieu of the untaken
holiday will only be payable on termination if there is an express
right to it under the contract or a clear term implied by custom and
practice. The contract may also choose to provide that such
additional entitlement is not payable where there is dismissal for
gross misconduct.
Under the WTR 1998 there is no requirement that workers repay
excess holiday taken in the year of leaving unless there is a ‘relevant
agreement’, eg the worker’s contract or a workforce agreement,
requiring this to be done.267 It will be an unauthorised deduction
under ERA 1996 Part II if the employer deducts the excess from the
worker’s wages without such an agreement.268
WTR 1998 reg 16 says a worker is entitled to be paid for annual
leave at the rate of a week’s pay. This is usually the worker’s
contractual entitlement for normal working hours. If the worker’s pay

4.96

fluctuates, an average is taken over the previous 52 weeks. If the
worker received no pay in any of the weeks in that period, paid
weeks in the previous year can be taken into account.269 The daily
rate of holiday pay for a salaried worker is calculated by dividing
his/her annual salary by the number of working days in the year – not
the number of calendar days.270
Read literally, by referring to the ‘normal working hours’ in the
worker’s contract, reg 16 could mean that a worker’s holiday pay
would fall far short of his/her usual pay packet, eg by excluding the
overtime, commission or allowances which would normally be
earned if the worker was at work (unless the worker’s contract
explicitly stated that such sums should be included). It has now been
established that under the WTD, holiday pay must represent a
worker’s normal earnings. If pay is variable, what is ‘normal’ should
be assessed over a representative period. Therefore a sum to
represent overtime, whether voluntary or compulsory,271 and
commission272 must be included if they are ‘normally’ earned.
Broadly regular and predictable overtime will be included, as
opposed to if it is only rare and unforeseen. Allowances should also
be included in holiday pay if: (i) they relate to personal and
professional status, eg allowances relating to seniority length of
service and professional qualifications; or (ii) the pay is intrinsically
linked to the performance of the tasks which a worker is required to
carry out under his/her contract of employment as opposed to
payments intended exclusively to cover occasional or ancillary
costs, eg an off-base allowance for pilots. Whether an allowance is
genuinely intended to cover costs may need investigation.273 How
HMRC treats the payment for tax purposes is irrelevant. It is an
employment tribunal’s opinion which counts. An allowance in
recognition of travel time should be paid as it is intrinsically linked
to work. On the other hand, reimbursement of fares or petrol costs
would be an ancillary cost which need not be included.274 Reg 16
should be notionally amended so as to allow this interpretation for
the first four weeks of holiday pay.275 However, because the caselaw is based on the requirements of the WTD, reg 16 in its

unamended form (ie usually without the addition of voluntary
overtime,276 commission277 etc) is still likely to apply to the extra
1.6 weeks granted by the WTR 1998.278
Untaken holiday: sickness
4.97

4.98

4.99

The position when a worker is absent for long periods due to sick
leave has led to some very complicated case-law, not least because
the WTR 1998 are not entirely compatible with principles laid down
by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under the
WTD. It should also be remembered that the WTD only covers the
basic four-week leave entitlement and is not concerned with
protecting the additional 1.6 weeks leave entitlement. The following
principles can therefore only be relied on in respect of four weeks’
leave.279 The current position appears to be as follows. Entitlement
to annual leave continues to accrue while the worker is absent
through sickness.280 If a worker has been off sick throughout the
holiday year or through the last part of the holiday year when s/he
still has some leave due, the employer must allow him/her to choose
whether to take paid annual leave while on sick leave or at some
other time (ie carry it over into future years). If the worker is never
able to take the annual leave, eg because s/he leaves the employment
in the next holiday year without ever having returned to work, s/he
must be paid in lieu for the previous year’s leave as well.281
This rolling forward of untaken holiday while a worker remains
off sick cannot be indefinite, although it must be allowed for longer
than the reference period (usually the holiday year). The EAT has
suggested that holiday can be taken no later than 18 months after the
end of the holiday year in which it accrued.282 The idea is that the
leave should not lose its connection with its original purpose, ie as a
period of rest from work.283
In order to carry forward his/her annual leave entitlement to the
next holiday year, it is not necessary for a sick worker to serve a
notice or even ask his/her employer to do so.284 However, if the
worker wishes to take his/her paid annual leave while on sick leave,
s/he should send his/her employer the appropriate notification,

4.100

4.101

indicating which dates should be considered as annual leave. If s/he
is at that time only receiving SSP, s/he should be paid her full pay for
the period. It is uncertain whether s/he can claim holiday pay if s/he
is already receiving full sick pay. On the one hand, this is very
unlikely because it would mean s/he receives double pay for the
holiday period; on the other hand, the right to take paid leave
becomes meaningless in that situation if s/he is not paid. It is
arguable, though untested, that if s/he is in the middle of a limited
period of full sick pay, the holiday pay period should be deducted
from that total, thus extending her full sick pay by the same amount of
time.
If a worker is unable to take pre-booked sick leave because s/he
falls ill, s/he must be allowed to take the leave at a further date.285
This also applies if the worker falls sick while on holiday,286 but the
worker should have good evidence that s/he was indeed ill at that
time.
The right to carry over annual leave where the worker was off
sick is contrary to the clear wording of WTR 1998 reg 13(9) (see
para 4.89 above). EU law effectively overrides the WTR 1998 on
this point. However, unless there is a relevant agreement, this only
applies to the four weeks’ holiday entitlement derived from the WTD
and not to additional leave.287
Untaken holiday: maternity and other special leaves

4.102

The logic of the case-law suggests that entitlement to annual leave
also accrues while a worker is absent for any other reason while the
contract of employment is still running, eg on statutory maternity
leave or parental leave. As well as accruing leave, it also seems that
the right to take annual leave is not lost while a worker is absent on
various leaves derived from EU law, such as statutory maternity
leave288 or parental leave. If the worker cannot take the leave
because of such absence, s/he must be allowed to carry it forward to
the next leave year.289 Where a worker also cannot take her
additional 1.6 weeks’ leave because she is on maternity leave, it is
likely that she should be allowed to carry it over under maternity

discrimination law. See chapter 11 regarding the rights of workers on
maternity leave and parental leave generally.
Untaken holiday: deterred by the employer
4.103

4.104

Apart from the exceptions in the previous paragraphs, on leaving
their job, workers cannot claim pay in lieu of untaken holiday prior
to the year of termination. A further exception is where a worker has
not taken annual leave because his/her employer has refused to pay
for it, perhaps due to an incorrect belief that the worker is selfemployed and therefore not entitled to it. It is irrelevant whether or
not the worker has actually asked to take leave. Unlike the position
with sickness, there is no limit on the period in respect of which the
worker can carry over and, where appropriate, accumulate leave
until termination. This is because it would have been the employer’s
fault – an employer who does not allow leave to be taken must bear
the consequences.290
Indeed, it is not only where the worker is deterred from taking
holiday because the employer has said it will be unpaid. There are
many subtle ways in which employers can deter workers from taking
paid leave, eg by continually refusing requests because of
understaffing or by letting it be known that insisting on holiday will
not be looked on favourably. The CJEU has now said that any
practice or omission by employers that may potentially deter a
worker from taking annual leave will count against them. Employers
do not have to force their workers to take paid leave, but they must
ensure that their workers are in a position to exercise such a right.
An employer must ensure, specifically and transparently, that
workers are actually in a position to take the paid leave by
encouraging them to do so, formally if necessary, and informing them
accurately and in good time of their rights. The burden of proof will
be on employers to show that they have exercised all due diligence
in order to enable workers actually to take holiday. If an employer
cannot show this, a worker will be entitled to pay in lieu when s/he
leaves the job.291 On the other hand, if a worker deliberately and in

4.105

4.106

4.107

full knowledge of the consequences, chooses not to take holiday, then
s/he will not be able to claim pay in lieu when s/he leaves.
Although workers may be able to claim pay for untaken holiday in
previous years in the circumstances described above, this seems only
to apply to the position on termination (unless their contract says
otherwise). While they are still employed, their right is probably
only to carry over the entitlement to the next year.292
The above applies where a worker was deterred from taking
holiday altogether. If the worker took unpaid holiday, believing s/he
was self-employed, s/he will not be able to carry over a claim for
pay for all the previous unpaid years on termination.293
As already stated, any right to claim for untaken holidays in years
prior to the year of termination in these circumstances applies to the
first four weeks of the statutory entitlement, ie the period covered by
the WTD.
Covid-19 related leave issues

4.108

4.109

Government guidance during the pandemic stated that workers
accrued holiday entitlement in the normal way while on furlough.294
Holiday pay should be based on the worker’s normal pay and not
reduced on the basis of any periods paid at 80 per cent while on
furlough – at least for the four weeks protected by the EU
Directive.295
Where it was not reasonably practicable for a worker to take some
or all of his/her annual leave during the relevant leave year ‘as a
result of the effects of coronavirus (including on the worker, the
employer, or the wider economy or society’, s/he is entitled to carry
the leave forward and take it during the next two leave years.296 The
government suggests that relevant factors as to whether it was
practicable may be that the business has faced a significant increase
in demand, disruption of the workforce, ability of the available
workforce to cover the worker’s leave, the worker’s own health and
need for time off, how much is left of the current leave year, and any
impact on wider society.297 The extra right to carry over only applies
to the first four weeks’ basic leave entitlement.

4.110

Once leave has been carried over, the employer can only tell the
worker not to take it on particular days if the employer has ‘good
reason to do so’.298 If the worker leaves before s/he has taken the
carried over leave, it should be paid in lieu on termination.299
Contractual holidays

4.111

The WTR 1998 provide for a minimum entitlement. There is nothing
to prevent an employer agreeing to give additional holidays beyond
the legal minimum entitlement, or agreeing that holiday can be
carried over or untaken holiday from past years paid on termination.
It is an obligation on the employer to give employees within two
months of starting employment a statement of particulars including
details of any terms and conditions relating to holidays, public
holidays and holiday pay.300

Enforcement of the WTR 1998
4.112

4.113

4.114

The statutory enforcement of the working hours is carried out by the
Health and Safety Executive (for schools, hospitals and factories,
etc) or the local authority (for retail, catering, offices and leisure,
etc).301 Inspectors have power to enter and inspect workplaces, to
issue improvement or prohibition notices and, in England and Wales,
to prosecute.302 Breach of the obligations can result in criminal
proceedings punishable by a fine. It is also an offence, punishable by
a fine or in some cases, prison, to obstruct an inspector. Where an
offence by a company is committed with the consent, connivance or
neglect of any director, manager or officer, that individual can also
be found guilty of the offence and punished.303
As stated at para 4.77, a worker has a contractual entitlement not
to be required to work more than 48 hours without his/her agreement.
Unfortunately, employers have no obligation to insist workers take
rest breaks and holidays (see para 4.84).
Individual workers can make an ET claim for any refusal to give
rest periods and breaks and paid holidays. The ACAS early
conciliation procedure applies.304 It is not enough that the employer

4.115

4.116

has organised shifts in a way which prevents breaks being taken. The
employer must actually have refused the breaks.305 The ET can
award compensation according to what is just and equitable having
regard to the employer’s default and any attributable loss for the
worker.306 However, it cannot order compensation for injury to
feelings.307 More detail with regard to holiday claims is set out
below.
It is unlawful to dismiss or subject a worker to a detriment for
insisting on his/her rights under the WTR 1998, eg for insisting on
taking breaks or refusing to work more than 48 hours.308 This
protection may be particularly important in the latter case, as it
seems a worker cannot claim compensation in an ET for being forced
to work more than 48 hours, but can only go to the county court or
High Court for a declaration as to breach of contract and, most
unlikely, an injunction.309 This is not a practical remedy and it may
be simpler for a worker, having made sure s/he is protected, to
inform the employer politely and in writing that in accordance with
the WTR 1998 s/he is not willing to work more than 48 hours.
Obviously a worker needs to tread carefully and be sure of his/her
rights before upsetting an employer in this way.
The employer must keep up-to-date records of workers who have
agreed to work longer than 48 hours per week, plus records which
are adequate to show that the 48-hour and night work limits are
complied with.310 Records must be kept for two years. It is an
offence for an employer not to comply with any of the relevant
requirements in the WTR 1998 including the keeping of adequate
records.311
Enforcing holiday claims

4.117

Apart from the sometimes complex questions of entitlement to
holiday pay, there are further difficulties regarding how a claim
should be made. The position is most straightforward when a worker
has left the employment and simply wants pay for untaken holidays in
the year of termination. Payment in lieu is explicitly allowed by the
WTR 1998 in such circumstances.312 and a claim can be made under

4.118

4.119

4.120

WTR 1998 reg 30 or as an unauthorised deduction under ERA 1996
s23.313 Where holiday has been taken but not paid for, a claim can
again be made either under WTR 1998 reg 30(1)(b) or as an
unauthorised deduction under ERA 1996 s23. Where there is a right
to compensation for not being allowed or able to take holiday,
compensation can be claimed under WTR 1998 reg 30(1)(a), but
probably not under ERA 1996 s23 because there has been no pay
deduction in the normal sense. The worker has simply been refused
his/her holiday entitlement.314
The time limits for unauthorised deductions claims under ERA
1996 s23 are set out at paras 4.20–4.23 above. The advantage of an
unauthorised deduction claim is where non-payment of holidays
extends back up to two years. This is because, where an employer
makes a series of deductions, time runs from the last of those
deductions. However, in the context of holiday payments, such a
series of deductions could be broken by occasional payments, eg if
the employer pays in lieu of holiday for the year of termination, but
not for earlier years. There is also a problem if the non-payments are
more than three months apart.
If the claim is made under WTR 1998 reg 30, the three-month time
limit is counted from when leave should have been allowed to begin,
or when payment should have been made, as the case may be. It is
subject to any extension if it was not reasonably practicable to get
the claim in on time.315 In some circumstances, if an employer has
misled a worker about his/her employment status, this may have
made it not reasonably practicable to bring the claim in time.316
Following the decision of the CJEU in King v The Sash Window
Workshop,317 it would seem that if there is a right to payment for
untaken holidays in previous years, such right crystallises on the date
the employment ends and the three months is counted from then. It is
arguable whether this avoids the two-year limit on back-claims
under ERA 1996 s23. However, the right to payment for previous
years does not carry over to termination if the worker actually took
the holiday but did not get paid for it.318

4.121

4.123

It was previously thought that the solution in regard to any timelimit problems with back claims might be to bring a breach of
contract claim. However, the government closed off that possibility
by stating explicitly that the statutory holiday entitlement does not
give any contractual rights.319 The position is different if the worker
has an additional entitlement set out explicitly in his/her contract.
One other difference between making a reg 30 claim and a section
23 claim may be as to whether compensation is awarded apart from
any financial loss. A section 23 claim is solely concerned with the
amount of any unauthorised deduction, ie what should have been paid
as holiday pay. Similarly, where a complaint under reg 30(1)(b) is
upheld, ie that the employer has failed to pay some or all of the
holiday pay due, the tribunal will order the employer to pay the sum
owing.320 On the other hand, where a claim under reg 30(1)(a) is
upheld because the employer has refused to allow the worker to take
holiday, the tribunal must make a declaration and can award
compensation which it thinks ‘just and equitable’ in the
circumstances having regard to any loss suffered by the worker and
the employer’s default.321
In general, because of the complexities and uncertainties, it is
usually best to claim under both WTR 1998 reg 30(1)(a) and/or (b)
and/or for an unauthorised deduction under ERA 1996 s23.

16 ‘Self-employed’ is not a precise legal term for these purposes. Some of the case-law uses the
word ‘self-employed’ only to refer to those who are not ‘workers’ because they are working for
clients/customers of their own business. Confusingly, other case-law describes limb (b) workers
also as a type of self-employed. Whatever the label, however, the cases are consistent regarding
which arrangements count as ‘worker’ and which do not.

Sex discrimination in pay or contract terms is covered by equal
pay law – previously the Equal Pay Act 1970 and now the
‘Equality of Terms’ section of the Equality Act (EqA) 2010. Pay
discrimination because of other protected characteristics is
dealt with as ordinary discrimination under the EqA 2010 in the
usual way.
The woman must compare her pay with that of a man in the
same employment employed on like work, work rated as
equivalent under a job evaluation study or work of equal value.
Where there is no comparator within the rules, a woman may
be able to claim direct sex discrimination based on a
hypothetical comparison if she has the evidence.
Once the woman proves like work or work of equal value, the
burden of proof passes to the employer to prove a material
factor defence, ie a genuine reason for the pay differential,
which is not tainted by direct sex discrimination.
If the reason amounts to indirect sex discrimination, the
employer must provide objective justification. In other cases, it
seems a neutral non-discriminatory reason (however bad) will
do.
Indirect discrimination is the biggest cause of unequal pay. The
concept of indirect discrimination in equal pay law is wider than
under normal discrimination law.
Equal value claims are traditionally lengthy and complex.
Recently, some large collective private sector claims have
been launched.
Pay audits can be ordered against employers who lose equal
pay claims in certain circumstances.
Private and public sector employers with at least 250
employees must publish annual information on male and

•

female pay differentials. There are also particular
requirements in the Scottish and Welsh specific duties.
EU law has been very influential on equal pay and will continue
to be so post Brexit (see chapter 3).

The legal framework
The legislation
5.1

5.2

5.3

Equal pay law is difficult to understand and apply. European Union
(EU) law has been particularly influential in this area, especially the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Article 157
(originally the Treaty of Rome Article 119).1 This book outlines the
key issues so that potential cases may be identified. ‘Like work’
claims can be relatively straightforward to run in the employment
tribunal (ET), but complex and lengthy procedures are involved for
‘equal value’ claims. An adviser considering running an equal value
claim for the first time should talk to someone who has done it
before.
‘Equal pay’ law has always referred to discrimination in pay as
between men and women, as opposed to any other protected
characteristic. Pay discrimination because of age or race, for
example, is dealt with in the same way as any other discriminatory
action. Although equal pay law most often deals with pay claims
including overtime, bonuses, recruitment premiums and sick pay, it
also covers sex discrimination in relation to other contract terms,2 eg
a company car or gym membership. Bonus payments usually arise
from the contract, but may on the facts be wholly discretionary and
therefore not within equal pay law.3
Originally equal pay law was set out in the Equal Pay Act (EqPA)
1970. It is now contained in Equality Act (EqA) 2010 Part 5 Chapter
3, which is headed ‘Equality of Terms’ and largely replicates the
EqPA 1970, though with some differences. A worker cannot pick and
choose whether she wants to bring her claim under the equal pay
rules or as ordinary sex discrimination. There are complicated rules

5.4

5.5

set out in EqA 2010 ss70 and 71 as to which (if any) legal protection
applies to particular situations. This is important because of the
different shape of the law and procedure as between equal pay and
ordinary sex discrimination. Most significantly, equal pay law
requires a woman to compare her pay or contract terms with an
actual male colleague, whereas sex discrimination law only needs a
hypothetical comparison. Equal pay cases also tend to be far longer
and more complicated than sex discrimination cases. One of the most
interesting developments in the EqA 2010 was that, in limited
circumstances, it may be possible to bring an ordinary direct sex
discrimination claim based on a hypothetical comparator in relation
to a pay term (see para 5.60 below).
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued
an Equal Pay Code of Practice, which is available on its website.4
The Code is admissible in evidence in any ET claim for equal pay
and, where relevant, it must be taken into account by the ET.
In 2021, the gender pay gap for all employees, measured as an
hourly rate, was 15.4 per cent. The gap has decreased from 27.5 per
cent in 1997, but progress has been painfully slow considering that
equal pay legislation has been in place for 40 years. Part-timers,
who tend to be women, earn far lower hourly rates than full-timers.
The gender pay gap for full-timers only was 7.9 per cent. For them,
the gap is close to zero up to the age of 40, after which it starts to
widen.5 Over the last fifteen years or so, a large number of claims
have been brought, especially in local government and the health
service. Unfortunately, the length and cost of equal value claims is
such that low-paid individuals cannot afford them. Equal pay cases
tend to be collective and backed by trade unions or run by private
solicitors on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis. The unions themselves have
struggled to finance the bigger claims. Thousands of equal pay
claims have been brought against local government regarding historic
pay discrimination. The 1997 ‘single status’ agreement (also known
as the ‘Green Book’) was intended to put manual and white collar
workers onto new single pay scales based on principles of equal
pay. Unfortunately, a large number of councils did not meet the

5.6

agreed deadline for implementation of 31 March 2007. Where job
evaluations did take place, some staff benefited, whereas others
were put on lower grades, although with a level of pay protection to
ease the transition. The validity of the pay protection agreements then
came under challenge. Similar sweeping changes occurred in the
NHS through ‘Agenda for Change’, with pay scales based on a new
job evaluation system. Most of the complicated equal pay case-law
in recent years has been in these areas. Regrettably, the scope for
negotiated equal pay agreements was weakened after unions became
anxious following challenges to collective negotiations brought by
some ‘no win, no fee’ lawyers. The difficulty facing unions is to
balance the interests of different groups of members, while
persuading employers to accept new equality deals for the future and
make generous settlements of past claims at a time when they are
short of money. If the interests of underpaid women in the past are
undervalued in this equation, it can lead to indirect sex
discrimination claims against the union.6 However, that is not to say
that negotiated deals can never be justified. In the last few years,
some large-scale equal pay cases have been brought in the retail
sector, particularly against certain supermarket chains.
As part of the public sector equality duty (PSED) under the EqA
2010, public authorities in carrying out their functions must have due
regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, which presumably
would include eliminating pay discrimination.7 Public authorities
with 250 or more employees must publish annual information on
gender pay differentials, and there are also precise requirements
under the PSED in the Scottish and Welsh specific duties (see para
5.64 onwards).

Who is covered?
5.7

Equal pay law under the EqA 2010 has wider scope than the unfair
dismissal provisions of the Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996. As
well as protecting employees employed on a contract of employment,
it covers workers employed under a contract of apprenticeship or a
contract personally to do work. Other categories are also covered,

eg Crown employees, parliamentary staff, those employed in the
armed forces and office holders.8 Both men and women can claim
equal pay under the EqA 2010. For ease of reference, this chapter
presumes a woman is bringing the claim.

Using EU law
Article 157
5.8

All UK workers can claim under Article 1579 in the ET in relation to
discrimination in pay. Article 157(3) requires that men and women
should receive equal pay for equal work and is expanded by the
Recast Directive.10 EU law is generally superfluous because it
duplicates rights which exist under UK law. However, in respect of
pensions and some other limited matters, EU law may be needed
because of exclusions and omissions from the UK legislation. For the
effect of Brexit on use of EU law, see chapter 3.

What does Article 157 mean by ‘pay’?
5.9

Unlike the EqA 2010, Article 157 does not apply to all terms and
conditions, but only to pay. This is important because it affects when
EU law can be called upon. Article 157(2) defines ‘pay’ as:
… the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in
cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of his
employment, from his employer.

5.10

This wide definition was confirmed by the European Court of Justice
(ECJ) in Garland v British Rail Engineering,11 which added that the
consideration may be ‘immediate or future, provided that the worker
receives it, albeit indirectly, in respect of his employment from his
employer’.
Article 157 can include overtime pay, commission and financial
allowances. Non-contractual discretionary payments can also be
included, eg voluntary bonuses. Both contractual12 and statutory
redundancy pay13 fall within Article 157, although payment by the

National Insurance Fund when the employer defaults is not
covered.14 Some payments made by employers under a statutory
obligation, eg statutory sick pay,15 may also be within Article 157.
Most significantly, Article 157 covers contributions towards and
benefits paid under contractual pension schemes, whether
supplementary to,16 or contracted-out from,17 the state pension
scheme. Compensation for unfair dismissal constitutes pay within
Article 157.18

The comparable man
Requirement for a comparator
5.11

Under equal pay law in EqA 2010 Part 5 Chapter 3 (unlike ordinary
sex discrimination law) a woman must usually find an actual man
with whom she can compare herself (unless she is complaining of
pay discrimination due to pregnancy).19 However, the EqA 2010
introduced a new exception whereby if a woman has evidence of
direct sex discrimination in pay, but cannot find a comparator within
the rules, she may be able to make an ordinary direct discrimination
claim under EqA 2010 s13 based on a hypothetical comparator (see
paras 5.3 and 5.60).

The same employment
5.12

The male comparator must be employed by the same or an associated
employer.20 An employer is an associated employer where one
company directly or indirectly has control of the other or where two
companies come under the control directly or indirectly of a third
person.21 In the context of an equal pay claim, this can include a
limited liability partnership.22 Under EqA 2010 s79, the comparator
must work at the same establishment as the woman. If he does not, he
must work at another establishment where common terms apply at the
establishments, either generally or as between the woman and her
comparator.23 ‘Common terms and conditions’ means terms which
are substantially comparable on a broad basis, as opposed to the

5.13

5.14

5.15

same terms subject only to tiny differences.24 A tribunal should make
a broad comparison – it should not embark on a detailed line by line
examination of the terms and conditions to decide this issue.25
The requirement for ‘common terms and conditions’ does not
mean as between the woman and her comparator, but as between the
comparator’s terms where he is working at the different
establishment, and the terms and conditions under which he would be
employed if he was working at the woman’s establishment.
Sometimes this is more obvious than at other times, but it is not
meant to be a major blockage on equal pay claims. The Supreme
Court has described it as a ‘threshold’ test, simply designed to weed
out cases where the comparator’s pay is obviously linked to a
different location for geographical and also perhaps historical
reasons.26
A typical (although not the only) example of where common terms
and conditions apply generally is where they are governed by the
same collective agreement.27 For example, in one case female
support staff employed by a local authority in schools could compare
their pay with that of male local authority staff who were not
employed in schools, since they were employed under the same
collective agreement on common terms.28 However, it is not
necessary for the same collective agreement to cover the woman and
her comparator. In Asda Stores Ltd v Brierly and others, the
Supreme Court upheld a decision where the claimants and other
retail workers did not have collectively negotiated terms at all,
whereas the comparators did have collectively negotiated terms.
It is not necessary for there actually to be any men employed in the
comparator’s type of job at the claimant’s establishment or for any
real possibility that men would be employed there in the future. This
is known as the ‘North hypothetical’.29 It is not even necessary for it
to be feasible to employ men on the comparator’s type of job there.
The tribunal might find it helpful eg to imagine, where a comparison
is made by a woman in retail with a man in a warehouse, what would
have happened if the warehouse was put adjacent to the retail store
at the woman’s establishment. It might be obvious what a comparator

5.16

5.17

5.18

terms and conditions would have been in this hypothetical situation
if, for example, terms and conditions for his job are set out in
collective agreements or elsewhere, without any mention of where
individuals are based.
The wider the definition of ‘establishment’, the more likely it is
that the woman will be employed at the same establishment as her
comparator, and any residual problems associated with crossestablishment comparisons will not arise. Recent case-law has
considered the meaning of the term ‘establishment’ in connection
with collective redundancy consultation (see para 2.21 above).
EqA 2010 s80(3) says that if work is not done at an establishment,
it is to be treated as done at the establishment with which it has the
closest connection. It is not entirely clear what this means, but
possibly it is intended to cover mobile workers or those who work
away from any base. For example, a mobile sales rep who works
from home but reports to head office might be treated as working at
head office.
Under Article 157 comparisons are not limited to where the man
and woman are employed by the same or an associated employer.30
The test is whether the comparator is employed in the same
establishment or service.31 It is essential that the pay differences can
be attributed to a ‘single source’, as otherwise there is no single
body which is responsible for the inequality and can restore equal
treatment.32 Examples where comparisons can be made between
different employers are:
1) where statutory rules apply to pay and conditions in more than one undertaking,
establishment or service, eg nursing salaries within a national health service;
2) where several undertakings or establishments are covered by a collective works
agreement;
3) where terms and conditions are laid down centrally for more than one organisation or
business within a holding company or conglomerate.33

The EHRC Equal Pay Code gives as an example where a claimant
and her comparator are employed by different education authorities,

5.19

5.20

but pay is set by a national scheme and can be remedied by a single
negotiating body.
As always, the cases very much depend on the factual
circumstances. In one case, teachers employed by different Scottish
councils were able to compare their pay because the salary scales of
both were set by the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee, a quasiautonomous body, and the whole structure of education was regarded
as a ‘service’.34 With teachers, much will depend on the legal status
of the school. Teachers employed by a voluntary aided or academy
school are unlikely to be able to compare themselves with local
authority employees.35 On the other hand, if the school is maintained
by a local authority with a delegated budget, a comparison probably
can be made; although theoretically governors can recommend terms
and conditions to the local authority, in reality, it is fanciful to
suggest they could force the local authority to appoint someone on an
inappropriate pay grade.36 Moving outside the teaching field, the
Court of Appeal said in a 2005 case that it was not permissible to
use comparators from different government departments because,
although technically they had the same employer (the Crown), power
to negotiate and set most aspects of pay was delegated to the
individual government departments without any co-ordination
between them.37 However, comments made in recent cases suggest
that the higher courts may now be prepared to pay more attention to
the closeness of the relationship between superficially autonomous
pay sources.38
Workers employed by a direct services organisation established to
submit an in-house tender in compliance with the requirements of the
Local Government Act 1988 may compare themselves with other
employees of the same council provided common terms and
conditions apply.39 It may also be possible for workers employed by
an arm’s length external organisation which is in reality under the
practical control of a local authority to compare their pay with that of
local authority staff.40 However, if the work is contracted out to
independent contractors, employees transferred to the new employer
can no longer compare their pay with that of council staff.41

5.21

5.22

Similarly, an agency worker, even if she previously worked for the
employer, cannot compare her pay with a directly employed member
of staff, assuming there is no single source in control of pay.42 Note
that it is not necessary to establish that there is a ‘single source’
when making a claim under the EqA 2010, where the simpler section
79 test is satisfied.43
Unlike the former EqPA 1970, the EqA 2010 states explicitly in
section 64(2) that the work with which comparison is made need not
have been done contemporaneously with the woman’s work. It was
already established that a woman may compare herself with a
predecessor, even one who left long before she started.44 Under the
EqPA 1970, the woman could not compare her pay with that of a
successor, because that amounted to making a hypothetical pay
comparison, which was not permitted under the EqPA 1970.45
However, under the EqA 2010, a comparison with a successor may
now be possible, either because of the new section 64(2) or because
it is relevant evidence supporting a hypothetical comparator (see
para 5.60).
In certain circumstances a man can make a claim contingent on his
female comparator’s claim against a different man. This is
sometimes called a ‘piggyback’ claim. For example, a male primary
school teacher could name as his comparator a female primary
school teacher whose pay was the same or less than his, pending
resolution of her equal pay claim using a male secondary school
teacher who was paid more than them both.46 Similarly, a male parttimer could make a claim contingent on the success of a female parttimer bringing an equal pay case on grounds of exclusion of parttimers from an occupational pension scheme.47 Piggyback claims are
important because men employed in female-dominated types of job
may get paid less along with the women because women’s type of
work is undervalued.

Comparable jobs
The nature of the comparison

A woman may compare herself with a man in the same employment if
she is doing equal work, ie:

5.23

•

she is doing work which is like his work, ie work which is the same or broadly similar, and
where any differences in the work they actually do are not of practical importance;48 or

•

she is doing work rated equivalent to his in a job evaluation study (JES) which gives the
work an equal value in terms of the demands made on a worker – or would do so if the
evaluation was not made on a sex-specific system, ie one which in respect of any of the
demands sets values for men different from those it sets for women;49 or

•

neither of the two previous categories apply, but she is doing work of equal value in terms
of the demand made on each worker by reference to factors such as effort, skill and
decision-making.50

Where the jobs seem fairly similar (but not identical), it is safer to
claim both ‘like work’ and, in the alternative, ‘work of equal value’
(assuming no JES applies). Then if the ET decides that some of the
differences between the jobs are significant, it can immediately turn
to the equal value claim.
The following points should be noted:

5.24
•

A woman can choose which man she wants to compare herself with and may choose more
than one.51 Choosing more than one man as comparator reduces the risk of losing because
the particular man chosen is in some way not typical, eg he has been favoured because he
is infirm or red-circled for a non-discriminatory reason. However, the woman should not
unreasonably choose too many comparators.

•

Even if there is a man in the same employment doing like work or work rated as equivalent
under a job evaluation scheme (and getting the same pay), a woman may still compare
herself with a different (higher paid) man who is doing work of equal value.52 This
prevents equal pay claims being defeated by the presence of one or two low-paid men in
predominantly female areas of work.

•

Where there has been a JES which rates the work of the woman as less than that of her
comparable man, the woman cannot claim equal value unless there are reasonable grounds
for suspecting that the JES was based on a system which discriminates because of sex or
is otherwise unreliable.53

•

A woman may claim equal pay and terms with those of a man whose work is rated lower
than hers under a JES, but this does not entitle her to higher pay or better terms than her
comparator.54

•

Under Article 157 a woman in an equal value claim may compare herself with a man
whose work turns out to be of less value than hers,55 although she can only claim pay equal
to his. ETs now commonly accept this under the domestic legislation as well.

Like work
5.25

The most straightforward situation where a woman can compare her
pay with that of a man in the same employment is if her work is like
his work. In deciding whether a woman is doing work like that of her
comparator, the ET should consider the matter in two stages.56
1) Is the work done by the woman and her comparator the same or broadly similar? At
this stage, the ET should make a general consideration of the type of work and the skill and
knowledge required to do it. So, eg women cleaners who clean offices and toilets should
easily pass the test when compared with male cleaners who clean offices and urinals.
2) Are any differences between the work done by the woman and her comparator of
practical importance in relation to the terms of employment? In other words, if the jobs
were both done by members of the same sex, would you expect the differences in their
tasks to warrant a difference in pay? This involves looking at the nature and extent of any
differences and how often they occur.57 It is important to consider the similarities as well
as the differences to avoid a distorted impression. Trivial differences or differences which
in the real world are unlikely to be reflected by a pay difference should be disregarded.
Differences such as additional duties, level of responsibility, skills, the time at which work is
done, qualifications, training and physical effort could be of practical importance.58 It does
not prevent it being ‘like work’ if the woman is doing more duties or a heavier workload
than her comparators.59

5.26

The ET must look at the tasks actually carried out by the woman and
her comparator, rather than to a (perhaps artificially inflated or
understated) job description or contract.60
The EHRC Equal Pay Code deals with ‘like work’ at paras 37–39
and gives examples of ‘like work’ claims which have succeeded
despite small differences in duties. The code says it is for the
employer to show that there are differences of practical importance
in the work actually performed. In any ‘like work’ claim, detailed
evidence of the work of both the woman and her comparator needs to
be presented to the ET. Often it can take an entire day at the ET to

draw out all the elements of each job. If there are several women
bringing a joint case, it is usually a good idea for each of them to
give evidence as to the nature of the job. This reduces the risk of key
elements being omitted.

Job evaluation studies
5.27

5.28

A woman can compare her pay with that of a man in the same
employment if she is doing work rated equivalent to his in a JES.
The EHRC Equal Pay Code deals with JESs at paras 40–47. A JES
is a study measuring the relative value of jobs, either solely of the
woman and her comparator, or of some or all workers in the same
employment. Sometimes a JES is called a job evaluation scheme.
For the purposes of the EqA 2010, a JES is a study undertaken with a
view to evaluating the jobs of some or all of the workers in terms of
the demands made on them by reference to factors such as effort,
skill and decision-making.61 The JES must encompass the woman’s
job and that of her comparator. Work is rated as equivalent if their
jobs are assessed as having the same number of points or within the
same job evaluation grade. So where an employer uses a JES which
bands job points in advance (eg 210–239 points will be put at grade
5; 240–279 points at grade 6), a woman obtaining, for example, 210
points can demand to be paid equally with a man obtaining anything
up to 239 points.62 In points-based systems, whether or not a small
difference in points means there is a material difference in the value
of the jobs depends on the nature of the job evaluation exercise.63
Because JESs are measured in terms of demands, it is possible for
very different types of job to be rated as equivalent.64 However, to
be valid, a JES must be analytic.65 An analytic JES is one which
evaluates jobs according to a breakdown of demands and
characteristics. Factors such as responsibility, working conditions,
physical and mental requirements are weighted and measured. A
non-analytic JES compares jobs on a ‘whole-job’ basis, eg by
ranking and paired comparisons. The JES must only take into account
factors connected with the job requirements as opposed to the person

5.29

5.30

doing the job, eg how well the job-holders are performing is
irrelevant.66
The JES must be thorough in analysis and capable of impartial
application.67 EqA 2010 s65(5) says the JES must not be made on a
‘sex-specific system’, ie one which sets values for men different
from those it sets for women for the purposes of one or more
demands.68 This rather unclear wording presumably refers to the
danger that a JES may itself be directly or indirectly discriminatory,
eg because it overvalues traditional male skills and attributes, such
as physical strength. The EHRC Equal Pay Code points out that
historically there has been a tendency to undervalue or overlook
qualities inherent in work traditionally undertaken by women, eg
caring.69
In summary, where there is an existing JES which is analytic, nondiscriminatory and not otherwise unreliable, it can serve two
functions:
1) a woman may claim equal pay and other terms and conditions equal to those of a man
whose work has been rated as equivalent (or less)70 under such a JES;71
2) where a woman’s work has been rated of less value than a man’s under such a JES, she
will be unable to prove her work is of equal value to his.72

Sometimes an employer may commission a JES after an equal value
claim has been started in an attempt to block the claim. In order to
have any effect, the JES must be completed at the latest by the final
hearing, and it is in the ET’s discretion whether it is willing to
postpone the hearing if the JES is not ready.73 A ‘completed’ JES
means one which has been accepted by the employers and workers
as a valid study, even though it may not yet have been implemented.74

Equal value claims
5.31

The hardest type of equal pay claim is one for equal value. It
requires imagination to identify possible cases where different jobs
can be considered of equal value when broken down into factors
such as effort, skill and demand. This is why special experts have

traditionally been used on equal value cases to analyse the jobs, but
this has led to expensive and lengthy procedures. For these reasons,
a few years ago, the government gave tribunals increased power to
make the equal value assessment themselves. In an equal value
claim, an analytic comparison must be made comparing the work of
the claimant and her comparator on a one-off basis for the
proceedings. This is different from a JES, which is usually done for
a whole range of jobs across the workplace, thus creating a general
ranking system. Most JESs are introduced co-operatively through
negotiation between the employer and trade union, whereas an equal
value comparison for a tribunal claim is an adversarial process.
Examples where jobs have been found of equal value are:
•

a group personnel and training officer with a divisional sales trainer;

•

a speech therapist with a psychologist;

•

a packer with a labourer;

•

a Grade A nurse with a joiner;

•

a cook, clerical officer and switchboard operator in a hospital with a maintenance assistant.

Equal value procedures are set out at para 5.73 onwards.

The material factor defence
5.32

Even where there is equal work, employers have a defence under
EqA 2010 s69 if they prove on a balance of probabilities that the
difference between the woman’s and the man’s pay (or other terms)
is because of a ‘material factor’ which does not involve direct sex
discrimination. If the material factor involves indirect sex
discrimination, the employer must prove that it is justifiable as a ‘of
achieving proportionate means to a legitimate aim’.75 The wording of
the defence is similar to that previously in the EqPA 1970, but it is
more explicit, partly in order to incorporate some of the case-law
which had developed previously. Nevertheless, cases referred to in
the following text need to be read with some care, as their
interpretation of direct and indirect discrimination was based on the
open wording of the EqPA 1970 and not on the more specific defence

set out in the EqA 2010. It is also helpful to look at paras 74–90 of
the EHRC Equal Pay Code which covers the defence.
Once the woman has shown there is equal work, the employer
must identify the material factor and prove:

5.33

•

it is the real reason for the difference in pay and not a sham or pretence;

•

the lesser pay is due to this reason;

•

the factor is ‘material’, ie significant and relevant;

•

the reason is not the difference of sex, whether direct or indirect discrimination.76

Therefore, provided the pay difference is for a genuine reason,
which is not tainted by any kind of sex discrimination, the employer
has a valid defence. It does not have to be a good reason, since the
purpose of equal pay law is to eliminate sex discrimination in pay,
not to achieve fair wages.77 It therefore seems likely that a pay
difference based on a mistake or a misunderstanding would still be
lawful.
There is an argument, derived from the Brunnhofer case,78 that
European law requires more than a neutral explanation, and requires
the employer to supply an objective justification for a pay variation
even if no indirect sex discrimination is involved. This would be
contrary to the EqA 2010. Unfortunately, Employment Appeal
Tribunal (EAT) cases have differed over whether Brunnhofer really
does require objective justification where no indirect discrimination
is involved.79 The later cases say that it does not, and this is now the
more widely accepted view.
As well as personal differences between the workers concerned,
such as experience and qualifications, the following are examples of
material factors, although whether the defence is made out will
depend on the specific circumstances in each case:

5.34

5.35

•

market forces and other economic considerations;

•

administrative efficiency;

•

geographical differences, eg London weighting;

•

unsocial hours, rotating shift and night working.

Some equal value cases have confused matters relevant to evaluating
the relative worth of each job such as skill, responsibility, effort,
with material factors which would justify a pay difference. The EAT
in Davies v McCartneys80 suggested that the employer could use as a
defence the very matters which were relevant in determining whether
a job was of equal value. This approach has been criticised and is
open to doubt: once two jobs have been evaluated as equal in terms
of these separate demands, employers ought not to be able to justify a
pay difference by saying that they personally value one job more
highly. An employer’s defence may be based on several factors.
Where an employer can only partially justify a pay differential, an
ET may accept the justification to that extent.81

Not a sex-based explanation: direct discrimination
5.36

5.37

As stated above, the employer must prove the material factor defence
does not involve treating the woman less favourably than her
comparator because of her sex.82 A defence which amounts to direct
sex discrimination cannot be justified.83 It may be quite easy for the
employer to show no direct discrimination was involved. For
example, in the absence of any other evidence, the ET is unlikely to
find any direct discrimination where the worker compares herself
with a man who is obviously more skilled and where there are also
many skilled women who receive the higher pay.
The woman may take it upon herself to prove direct sex
discrimination, eg by relying on something she was told or has found
out about the true reason for her lower pay; for example, she has
heard that the employer believes women will work for less pay than
men. Alternatively, the factor put forward by the employer may itself
contain an element or history of direct sex discrimination, which is
readily apparent or becomes clear on examination, eg in one case84 a
material factor defence of red-circling was rejected because it was
based upon previous direct sex discrimination, excluding women
from male pay and jobs in the 1960s. It would also be direct
discrimination if men, in jobs which tended to be male preserves,
had been paid bonuses precisely because they were men.85 On the

5.38

other hand, there may be explanations for paying the woman less
which are not because of her sex. For example, if a male employee
was put on a higher point on an incremental scale on starting a job
because of his greater experience, this may well remain an
explanation for the disparity in subsequent years even after the
female employee has caught up in terms of experience.86 Another
possibility is that, following a TUPE transfer,87 women already
employed by the transferee find themselves paid less than men who
are transferring into the organisation. This may not be direct
discrimination, if the genuine reason causing the differential – and
for maintaining it is that the men’s terms and conditions had to be
preserved on transfer.88 If women were disproportionately affected,
it may amount to indirect discrimination, and the employer would
have to justify retaining the differential.
A market forces defence can be acceptable, provided it is not
discriminatory. The employer must prove the exact amount of the pay
differential which is due to market forces. It is for the employer to
show the market dictated the higher pay, not for the woman to show
her comparator’s pay was too high.89 A market forces defence can be
discriminatory where there is job segregation, since femaledominated jobs tend to be paid less precisely because they are
traditionally carried out mainly by women. For example, in Ratcliffe
v North Yorkshire CC90 the council’s direct services organisation
(DSO) reduced the pay of catering assistants (who were almost
exclusively female) in order to compete successfully on a
compulsory competitive tendering exercise. Three women brought an
equal value case comparing themselves with male council workers,
such as road sweepers and refuse collectors, whose work had been
rated equivalent under a JES. The House of Lords rejected the
council’s argument that the DSO had to be able to compete on the
open market. This defence was based on sex because the council’s
competitors could pay less on the open market precisely because
such work was done mainly by women.91

Unjustifiable indirect discrimination

5.39

5.40

The material factor defence also fails if it involves indirect sex
discrimination which the employer is unable to justify by showing it
is a ‘proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’.92 In
describing indirect discrimination, EqA 2010 s69(2) refers to a
situation where, ‘as a result of the factor’, the woman and other
women doing work equal to hers are put at a particular disadvantage
when compared with men doing work equal to hers. This wording is
not completely clear and does not easily match all situations covered
by the previous case-law. For example, as a result of the ECJ
decision in Enderby,93 an employer is required to justify a statistical
imbalance in disadvantage even where the factor causing that
imbalance cannot be identified.
In the EqPA 1970, there was no definition of direct discrimination
and indirect discrimination at all, so the concepts needed to be
developed by case-law. As a result, the concept of indirect
discrimination in equal pay, when read together with European
legislation and case-law, developed in a way which was broader
than ordinary sex discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act
1975. It is unlikely to be lawful for the EqA 2010 to be interpreted in
a way which is more restrictive than previous case-law. Equal pay
indirect discrimination can take many forms, but essentially it breaks
down into two main categories:
1) The normal type of indirect discrimination recognised in EqA 2010 s19 (see chapter 13)
where the employer applies a provision, criterion or practice (PCP) which puts women at a
particular disadvantage compared with men, eg paying part-timers a lower hourly rate or
paying a higher salary for previous experience in a male-dominated industry. Sometimes the
true (and indirectly discriminatory) reason is hidden or not obvious, eg a woman is really
being paid less because she cannot work unsocial hours, whereas the employer contends
that the pay differential is because she is less competent at her job.
2) Enderby-type indirect discrimination, where two groups of workers doing work of equal
value receive different pay and there is sufficient statistical disparity in the gender
breakdown of each group.94 For example:
•

A job which is carried out almost exclusively by women, or where a significant number
are women, is paid less than a job carried out predominantly by men.95 It does not

matter if there are a significant number of men in the disadvantaged group (although
this may indicate that the employer will have a defence unrelated to sex).96
•

The employer uses a pay system which is wholly lacking in transparency (see para
5.41), but the average pay for women is less than the average pay for men.97

It is important that the pay system is clear and easy to understand;
this has become known as transparency. A transparent system is one
where workers understand not only their rates of pay but the
components of their individual pay packets. The ECJ has said that
where an employer operates a pay system which is wholly lacking in
transparency but appears to operate to the substantial disadvantage of
one sex, the onus will be on the employer to explain and justify
objectively the differential, even if the individual worker cannot
identify why she has been paid less.98 According to the EHRC Equal
Pay Code, where the disadvantaged group is predominantly women
and the group of advantaged comparators is predominantly men, it
will be hard for an employer to prove there is no unlawful sex
discrimination.99
To measure the adverse impact, the tribunal can choose to look at
the proportion of men and women disadvantaged by the practice or at
the proportion of those advantaged by the practice – whichever
realistically tests the issue. The tribunal should consider everyone
affected by the relevant practice, whether positively or negatively,
but there is no single suitable pool for comparison in every case.100
To justify indirect discrimination, the employer must show it is a
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The EHRC Equal
Pay Code gives examples at paras 89–91. Under the case-law, the
employer must prove:

5.41

5.42

5.43

•

there is a real need on the part of the undertaking;

•

the measures chosen by the employer are appropriate for achieving the objective in
question; and

•

the measures chosen by the employer are necessary to that end.101 ‘Necessary’ does not
mean it has to be the only course available to the employer: it just means ‘reasonably’
necessary.102 The ET must balance the discriminatory effect against the justification put
forward.103

5.44

5.45

5.46

5.47

It seems that the justification need not contemporaneously and
consciously feature in the employer’s decision-making process, and
the reason put forward at a tribunal hearing can even be a reason
different from the one in the employer’s mind at the time the pay was
decided upon.104 Nevertheless, retrospective justification will be
harder to prove.105 Moreover, where a material factor applied at a
particular point in time, but no longer applied for the period when
equal pay was claimed, it can no longer provide a defence to indirect
discrimination.106 For example, bonus schemes which once were
dependent on productivity may by now have become automatic
payments; where these were originally negotiated in male job areas
(as has tended to happen historically), excluding women in female
job areas from equivalent bonuses may no longer be justifiable.107
It is a common defence that the different pay rates were arrived at
by independent and distinct collective bargaining processes. This is
probably not sufficient justification where the outcome is a disparity
between the mainly female group and the mainly male group, even if
no direct or indirect discrimination can be identified within each
process.108 Otherwise an employer could easily circumvent the
principle of equal pay by using separate bargaining processes.109
Indirectly discriminatory terms are not justifiable purely because
they have been agreed with a trade union – the union negotiators may
not have realised their effect.110
Sometimes an employer tries to defend a case on the basis that
s/he cannot afford to pay the worker more. This may amount to
indirect discrimination if the worker is in a job which tends to be
done by women, and if her comparator is in a job mainly done by
men. Budgetary considerations alone cannot justify indirect
discrimination in pay.111
The ECJ’s most explicit guidance on what may be considered
justifiable or not in indirect discrimination is in Danfoss.112 In that
case, the employer awarded pay increments on the basis of a number
of criteria, ie flexibility, quality of work, vocational training and
seniority. It was not apparent to the workers precisely how the level
of each person’s pay had been arrived at, but the net effect was that

5.48

5.49

5.50

women were on the whole paid less than the men. The ECJ said that
where a pay system is characterised by a total lack of transparency,
that is, where it is impossible to tell precisely how each worker’s
pay level was reached, and where there is a statistical imbalance
between the pay of male and female workers, the onus is on the
employer to justify the difference.
The ECJ then examined each of the criteria. It recognised that
proportionally fewer women were likely to score highly on criteria
such as flexibility, vocational training and seniority. Therefore,
where statistics indicated that women were generally paid less than
men on the basis of flexibility or vocational training criteria, the
employer must justify the use of each criterion by showing it was ‘of
importance for the performance of the specific duties entrusted to the
worker concerned’.
The ECJ took a radical position in respect of merit payments. It
said that if women were, on the whole, paid less on the basis of
‘quality of work’, this could not be justified because ‘it is
inconceivable that the work carried out by female workers would be
generally of a lower quality’. In other words, the employer must be
directly discriminating.
In Danfoss, the ECJ said the employer need not justify the use of
the seniority criterion because that was obviously justifiable. In the
subsequent case of Nimz v Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg,113 the
ECJ appeared to change its mind. In Cadman v Health and Safety
Executive,114 the ECJ largely returned to its position in Danfoss. It
said that an employer does not usually have to justify using length of
service as a determinant of pay because length of service goes hand
in hand with experience, and experience generally enables workers
to perform their duties better. However, where the woman can
provide evidence raising serious doubts as to whether length of
service, in the particular circumstances, would lead to better
performance, then the employer must still provide detailed
justification. The ECJ did not clarify how difficult it would be to fall
within this exception.115

EqA 2010 s69(3) says that the long-term objective of reducing
inequality between men’s and women’s terms of work must always
be regarded as a legitimate aim. Nevertheless, employers must prove
that the steps they have taken were genuinely intended to reduce
inequality. Also, the means used must be proportionate.116 One of the
issues related to this concerns pay protection. Agreements negotiated
with many local authorities in recent years for new unified pay
scales included several years’ pay protection for those whose pay
would be reduced under the new scales. However, where a woman
has previously been paid less due to historic direct or indirect sex
discrimination, it is not necessarily justifiable to deprive her of a
sum for pay protection just because her pay is not in reality
reduced.117 Although the purpose of pay protection is to cushion
employees against the shock of an actual salary cut, granting it for an
extended period to those previously paid higher rates simply
perpetuates past inequality. Whether or not it is justifiable in a
particular case depends on a variety of factors, eg the extent of the
cut, the duration of the protection, the extent to which the employer is
trying to eliminate past discrimination, the cost for an employer of
equalising up the pay disparities, the industrial relations
consequences of imposing pay-cuts and the extent to which the unions
insisted on protection as the price for agreeing single status.

5.51

Summary
In summary, the key principles relating to the defence are as follows:

5.52
•

the onus is on the employer to prove any defence;

•

the material factor must be significant and relevant;

•

the material factor must not be discriminatory, either directly or indirectly;

•

if the factor involves direct discrimination, it cannot be justified;

•

if the factor involves indirect discrimination, the employer must objectively justify it;

•

where pay is governed by merit, flexibility, training or seniority, the comments of the ECJ in
the Danfoss case118 should be borne in mind;

•

for service-related pay, see comments of the ECJ in Cadman v Health and Safety
Executive;119

•

where the pay system is wholly lacking in transparency, the onus will be on the employer to
justify a pay differential which appears substantially to disadvantage one sex.

Part-time workers
5.53

5.54

5.55

Many ECJ cases concern lower pay and benefits for part-time
workers.120 There is a general recognition that a far higher
proportion of women than men are in part-time work and the issue
has been whether employers can justify the differential. In the key
case of Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz,121 a German
department store (in line with West German state legislation)
excluded part-time workers from its occupational pension scheme.
The ECJ said that where a pay practice, applied generally, operated
to disadvantage more women than men, it would infringe Article 157
(see para 5.1) unless it were objectively justifiable.122
Working full-time is not a justification in itself for receiving
greater hourly pay. Nor would the ECJ in Rinner-Kühn v FWW
Spezial-Gebaüdereinigung GmbH123 accept as justification an
argument that part-timers were less integrated into the business than
full-timers. However, it may be justification if an employer can show
that for economic or administrative reasons it needs to discourage
part-time working.
In another case, the ECJ has said that a civil service rule whereby
job-sharers progress up an incremental pay scale only in accordance
with time actually worked and therefore at half the speed of fulltimers with equal competence, cannot be justified merely on the
grounds of saving costs.124 Unfortunately it seems that restricting
overtime supplements to cases where the normal full-time working
hours are exceeded is not unlawful.125 On the other hand, it can be
indirect discrimination (unless justified) to apply a rule that neither
part-timers nor full-timers get paid for the first three hours of
overtime each month, since this would represent a higher proportion
of part-timers’ hours.126 It may also be unlawful, unless justified, to
pay a lower hourly rate for overtime than for normal working hours,
since part-timers could end up working the same amount of hours as
their full-time colleagues for less pay.127

5.56

5.57

Statutory entitlement to certain payments such as redundancy pay,
sick pay and unfair dismissal compensation is often subject to
requirements, eg length of service or age, which may have indirectly
discriminatory effect. There have been several major cases
challenging such requirements.128
In addition to the above, it may be contrary to the Part-time
Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations
2000129 unjustifiably to pay a part-timer less than a comparable fulltimer.

The sex equality clause
5.58

When an equal pay claim based on an actual comparator succeeds,
the way equal pay law operates is to insert an equality clause into the
contract of the woman.130 Each contractual term that is less
favourable than the equivalent term in the contract of the comparable
man is modified to make it equal. It is irrelevant that, looking at the
contracts as a whole, the woman may be said to be equally treated.
For example, where a woman receives less basic pay, but better
holiday and sick pay, she is nevertheless entitled to have her basic
pay increased to the male level.131 Similarly under Article 157 (see
para 5.1), the ECJ has said that the principle of equal pay entails
equality in each component of remuneration and does not look at
whether the total benefits are the same.132 In Degnan, the Court of
Appeal suggested that monetary payments, eg basic pay, fixed
bonuses and attendance allowances, should be added together and
regarded as a single term.133 However, this decision should be
regarded as a result of its particular facts, as the bonuses and
allowances were part of basic pay in that particular workplace – the
allowances were paid simply for turning up for work and not
necessarily even for completing shifts.134 More recently, a
percentage bonus for working at unsocial times within normal
contracted hours was not regarded as part of basic pay. It did not
matter if the woman received a higher basic pay rate because this

5.59

was a separate term.135 However, the overall picture may be relevant
to the employer’s defence.136
Once the woman’s contract is modified, it remains so even if her
male comparator leaves or is promoted or demoted. This means she
will be entitled to pay arrears even after her comparator has left his
job.137

Hypothetical pay comparisons
5.60

5.61

Where a woman has evidence of direct sex discrimination in pay, but
there is no actual comparator within the equal pay rules, she may be
able to make an ordinary direct discrimination claim under EqA
2010 s13.138 The advantage of such a claim is that a hypothetical
comparison can be made, and it avoids all the complexities of usual
equal pay procedure. However, the woman cannot just choose to
bring a section 13 claim.139
It is difficult to know what level of evidence will be required to
persuade an ET that there has been direct discrimination in pay
based on a hypothetical comparator. The EHRC Equal Pay Code
gives a very simplistic example at para 63, ie where an employer
tells a woman that she would be paid more if she were a man. There
is no reason why such explicit evidence should be required to
succeed in a claim. As discussed in chapters 13 and 16, an inference
of direct discrimination can be drawn from a variety of evidence. In
an equal pay context, useful evidence may include the treatment of
other workers who do not come within the technical definition of an
equal pay comparator, but who are employed by the same employer
and whose pay is significantly higher, eg where there is a man doing
work of only slightly higher value than the woman, but being paid a
lot more, or conversely, where the woman is doing obviously higher
value work than a man, but is not paid any more than him. It may also
be useful evidence if a male successor is paid more than the woman,
although it is easy to envisage explanations for that which are not
direct discrimination.

Occupational pensions

5.62

Equal pay law also covers pensions. This is a complex area which is
outside the scope of this book. It is also a developing area as a result
of certain European rulings regarding sex discrimination in pensions
based on actuarial factors. The following is a very rough overview.
Whereas a sex equality clause is implied into the contracts of men
and women doing work of equal value, a sex equality rule is implied
into occupational pension schemes.140 This applies to terms of
membership and to the way scheme members are treated. As with
non-pension equal pay cases, there is a potential material factor
defence.141 There are also some express exceptions in the EqA 2010
Sch 7. ETs and possibly the courts have jurisdiction to deal with
pension claims.142 Time limits are as set out below for equal pay
claims generally.143 If an ET finds discrimination in terms of
membership or in treatment of scheme members, it can make a
declaration that the woman has a right to join the scheme and as to
terms of membership with retroactive effect.144 The EqA 2010 tries
to address the difficulties which can arise where trustees of an
occupational pension scheme do not have power to make sex
equality alterations to the scheme.145 If there has been discrimination
in the terms on which a member is treated, the ET can award arrears
or damages for a specified period.146

Pregnancy and maternity
5.63

Unfavourable treatment of a woman because of pregnancy or
maternity in non-contractual pay or benefits is covered by normal sex
discrimination law. In regard to contractual pay and benefits, the
woman’s position is covered by a ‘maternity equality clause’.147 The
idea of a maternity equality clause was new in the EqA 2010, but the
rules are those already established by previous case-law. A woman
cannot claim equal pay with a man while she is on maternity leave.
However, under EqA 2010 s74 a woman is protected regarding some
aspects of her pay.148

Gathering information on pay

Gender pay reporting
5.64

5.65

5.66

After several unsuccessful attempts at encouraging voluntary gender
pay reporting, in 2017 the government issued regulations requiring
public and private sector employers with at least 250 employees to
publish annual information regarding pay differentials.149 The
Government Equalities Office (GEO) has issued detailed
guidance.150 The information must be published on the organisation’s
website and any other website specified by the government for at
least three years in a manner which is accessible to the public and
other employees. In the private sector, the information must be
accompanied by a signed statement of a director or equivalent senior
person that the information is accurate. Public authorities listed in the
regulations include local government, health trust, publicly funded
schools and central government (except for security departments).151
The information relates to the pay of employees employed at the
‘snapshot date’ (5 April for private sector employers and 31 March
for public authorities). Public authorities were required to publish
their first information by 30 March 2018, relating to those employed
on 31 March 2017. Private employers had to publish their first
information within 12 months of 5 April 2017.
The relevant employees are basically those employed under a
contract of employment or of apprenticeship or, unless data is not
available, under a contract personally to do work. Part-timers and
job-sharers are counted as individuals. The GEO Guidance says
agency workers are included as part of the headcount of the agency,
not the organisation where they are placed. The GEO Guidance has
advised that furloughed employees should be included in the report.
Those with topped up wages would be a ‘full-pay relevant
employee’ and those without topped up wages would be a ‘relevant
employee’. Employers should add a supporting narrative if furlough
and Covid-19 affected the gender pay gap.152
The information comprises the difference between the mean hourly
rate of male and female employees, the median hourly rate of male
and female employees, the mean bonus paid to male and female
employees and the median bonus paid to male and female employees.

5.67

5.68

It must also include the proportion of male and female employees
who were paid bonus pay, and the proportion of male and female
employees in each of four evenly divided pay bands from bottom to
top. The regulations set out how to calculate the figures in each of
these categories and the GEO Guidance gives further examples. The
pay includes basic pay, allowances and shift premiums, but not
overtime.
A private employer’s failure to comply with these requirements
constitutes an unlawful act under Equality Act (EqA) 2006 s34, in
respect of which the EHRC can take enforcement action. Failure by a
public authority to comply with the rules would be a breach of the
PSED. The EHRC has power to take enforcement action against any
employer not complying with their reporting duties.153 It paused its
enforcement action for six months during 2021 due to the pandemic,
but encouraged reports still to be submitted by the usual deadline.
What is strikingly missing from these rules is any requirement to
do anything about any pay gap which is revealed by the information.
The GEO Guidance recommends an action plan as good practice to
redress the gender pay gap.154 In addition, pay audits are
recommended by the EHRC Equal Pay Code at para 163, and there is
guidance for large organisations on auditing equal pay on the EHRC
website.155 The GEO has also published statistics for the two years
of pay reporting together with related research.156 The research
suggests that roughly half of employers have voluntarily published an
action plan. The EHRC has suggested action plans and explanatory
narratives should be made compulsory.157 Moreover, in the public
sector it can be argued that the PSED already requires open pay
audits.158 The Scottish special duties require authorities of 150 or
more employees to publish information on the gender pay gap within
the authority as well as specifying their pay policy in relation to
gender, disability and race where there is occupational
segregation.159 The Welsh special duties require authorities to have
equality objectives which address the cause of any pay differences
as between those with different protected characteristics, and in
respect of gender pay differences, they must set out an action plan.160

In October 2014, tribunals were given power to order compulsory
pay audits in certain circumstances where employers have lost equal
pay cases (see para 5.89).

Pay secrecy clauses
5.69

Secrecy about pay allows discrimination to continue. One of the
innovations in the EqA 2010 was the introduction of a ban on pay
secrecy clauses, although this is not quite as effective as it seems at
first sight. Under EqA 2010 s77, a contract term which tries to
prevent or restrict a person from disclosing information about their
pay or other terms is unenforceable. This applies to disclosure to
work colleagues, trade union representatives or anyone else, inside
or outside of the organisation. In addition, a contract term is
unenforceable if it tries to prevent someone seeking disclosure from
a colleague or former colleague about the colleague’s pay or other
terms. A ‘relevant pay disclosure’ is only protected if it is made for
the purpose of enabling the person who makes it or to whom it is
made, to find out whether or to what extent there is a connection
between pay and having a protected characteristic in relation to the
work in question. In other words, a term must not prevent discussion
about pay and terms in order to find out whether there is
discrimination related to a protected characteristic (not only sex, but
any of the protected characteristics, eg race or age). However, a term
can still prohibit general chat about pay which is not linked to
protected characteristics. Although this at first sight does not seem to
matter, it is often through such general pay comparisons that people
notice pay discrimination which they would not previously have
considered. The restrictive wording of EqA 2010 s77 also means
confidentiality clauses in workers’ contracts can still be used to
prevent them disclosing their pay to competitors. Making or seeking
a relevant pay disclosure or receiving information disclosed in a
relevant pay disclosure are protected acts for the purposes of the law
on victimisation, ie a worker must not be treated unfavourably
because s/he has in good faith done these things or because the
employer believes s/he has done or may do these things.161

Questionnaires
5.70

5.71

A discrimination questionnaire procedure has applied to equal pay
cases since 2003, working in the same way as in other types of
discrimination cases.162 The statutory procedure was abolished by
the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government and
replaced by a less structured non-statutory (voluntary) procedure for
‘contraventions’ on or after 6 April 2014.163 There was ACAS
guidance for the non-statutory procedure, but at the time of writing,
the author has been unable to find it online.
Some employers may object to disclosing information regarding
the pay of other workers on grounds of confidentiality or breach of
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However,
information can be disclosed about other workers where they consent
or where information is disclosed for the purpose of or in connection
with legal proceedings.164 Anonymity is also a possibility which
will be acceptable in some situations.

Trade unions and freedom of information
5.72

In a unionised workplace, another way to find out information about
pay practices in the workplace is through the collective bargaining
machinery. It is arguable that statistical information regarding pay
forms part of the information which an employer must give a
recognised union to bargain effectively.165 In the public sector, a
freedom of information request could be made166 although this may
run into problems of confidentiality where precise salaries (rather
than bands) of identifiable individuals are sought.

Equal value procedure
Overview
5.73

Traditionally, equal value claims have been long and drawn out,
often taking two or more years to complete. Expert evidence and
legal representation is almost certain to be used by one or both
parties and cases tend to be extremely time-consuming and

expensive. For these reasons, equal value cases are usually brought
by more than one worker (and sometimes by hundreds or thousands)
or with an agreement with the employer that all similarly
circumstanced female workers will get the benefit (including back
pay) of any favourable decision in a test case.
In October 2004, changes were made to the procedural rules, with
the clear intention of controlling the length of case preparation. It
was hoped that the built-in timetables would make considerable
improvements on the past, ideally enabling hearings to take place
within six to nine months, depending on whether an expert is
appointed. However, the evidence suggests that, if anything,
procedural changes have slowed things down. Equal value claims
remain long, complex and expensive. If the woman has a good ‘like
work’ claim against a different comparator which would lead to the
same compensation, it may sometimes be possible to separate the
claims and ask the ET to deal with the like work claim first. If it is
successful, the equal value claim need not be pursued.
The procedural steps of an equal value claim are usually as
follows, although there may be additional interim hearings if
necessary:

5.74

5.75

•

(Claim;167 response.)

•

Preliminary hearing for early case management to decide matters such as whether nonequal pay claims should go ahead first; the identity of the comparators; the scope of the
stage 1 hearing and any necessary preparatory orders.

•

Stage 1 equal value hearing, mainly to decide whether to appoint an independent expert and
make orders for case preparation.

•

Stage 2 equal value hearing, only if an independent expert has been appointed, to decide
facts on which his/her report should be based.

•

The full hearing at which the ET makes its decision.

The steps are set out in more detail below. There are special rules of
procedure for equal pay claims in Employment Tribunals
Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations (ET Regs) 2013
Sch. 3,168 but they set out unrealistic timescales.

Stage 1 equal value hearing
5.76

5.77

5.78

If there is a dispute as to whether the work is of equal value, there
will be a stage 1 equal value hearing, which can be heard by an
employment judge alone.169 When the ET notifies the parties of the
stage 1 hearing date, it will also set out what will be dealt with at the
hearing and the standard case management orders. The tribunal may
decide it would be useful to have an ordinary preliminary hearing
first to decide on the scope of the stage 1 hearing and necessary
orders. For example, the employer may argue that the ET should
strike out the claim if the claimant’s work was rated less than her
comparator’s under a suitable and non-discriminatory JES.170 If so,
this issue needs to be identified in advance of the stage 1 hearing. An
ET can also strike out the claim on any of the usual grounds, eg
because it has no reasonable prospect of success.
Assuming the claim is not struck out, the ET will decide whether
to determine the question of equal value itself171 or to appoint an
independent expert to prepare a report. If either party requests, the
ET can choose to hear evidence at this early stage regarding whether
there is a material factor defence, before deciding whether to appoint
an expert. If the ET does decide to appoint an expert, it can change
its mind or choose a different expert at any time.172
The ET will make appropriate orders with timescales for the next
steps of case preparation. If not already clear, the claimant will be
ordered to disclose the name of her comparator(s) or if she is unable
to do so, to disclose information which will enable the employer to
identify who she is referring to (within 14 days). If possible, the
employer must then give the claimant the relevant name(s) (within a
further 14 days). The claimant will also be ordered to set out the
period within which she wishes the comparison to be made. The
tribunal will usually order each party to prepare a job description
for the claimant and her comparator(s) and then exchange the job
descriptions (within 28 days). Any other relevant facts should also
be identified. The employer will be ordered to provide access to the
premises within a specified period so that the claimant and her
representative can interview any comparator. The idea is then that

5.79

5.80

the parties should then meet or otherwise liaise so that within eight
weeks of the stage 1 hearing they can present the tribunal with agreed
facts, agreed job descriptions and identify points of dispute.
If an independent expert is involved, the next stage will be a stage
2 hearing at which the tribunal will supplement the agreed facts with
its own fact findings regarding the content of the jobs (see below). If
there is no independent expert, it is possible that the next stage will
be the full merits hearing. Either way, the tribunal is likely to order
that witness statements be exchanged at least eight weeks before the
next hearing, and that at least 28 days before the hearing, the parties
send the tribunal a statement of agreed and disputed facts and issues
with a summary of the reasons for disagreeing. If an independent
expert is appointed, s/he must be copied into all relevant
information. It is usually best if s/he is appointed at an early stage, so
that s/he can be shown the draft job descriptions and make comments
before any agreement between the parties is finalised. S/he should
also be invited to attend any meetings between the parties for the
purpose of agreeing facts. The ET can order the employer to grant the
independent expert access to interview relevant staff or management
on the premises.173
Finally, the ET will fix a date for the full hearing or, if an expert is
to be appointed, for a stage 2 equal value hearing. In the multiple
public sector claims, this indicative timetable is not being met, with
the stage of agreeing facts and job descriptions prior to instructing
experts taking a very long time, sometimes years.

Stage 2 equal value hearing
5.81

A stage 2 hearing in front of a full ET is held where an independent
expert has been appointed.174 At the stage 2 hearing, the ET will
make a decision as to any facts that have not been agreed between the
parties and will require the expert to prepare his/her report on the
basis only of those facts agreed by the parties or decided by the ET.
The ET will usually order the expert to prepare and send his/her
report to the ET and parties by a specified date. It will also fix a date
for the full hearing. The ET has power at any stage, on its own

initiative or at a party’s request, to order the independent expert to
help the ET in establishing the facts on which s/he will rely in
preparing his/her report.175 This may be useful if the parties cannot
agree facts or a party is not legally represented or is withholding
information.

The full hearing
5.82

The expert’s report will be used as evidence in the full hearing,
unless it is not based on the agreed or determined facts. If the ET
does not allow in the report, it can appoint a different expert or
decide the matter itself. The ET can refuse to allow in evidence or
hear arguments put by either party if not previously disclosed to the
other as ordered or required by the rules.176 At the hearing, the ET
will decide whether the job is of equal value and whether the
employer can prove a material factor defence. If the employee wins,
the ET may go on to decide remedy there and then.

Expert evidence
5.83

If an independent expert is appointed, the ET will use an expert from
the panel of independent experts nominated by ACAS and make
contact after the stage 1 hearing. The ET rules set out the duties and
powers of the independent expert.177 The ET sends the parties its
brief to the independent expert. The expert will get copies of all the
relevant information (see para 5.79) and be available to attend
hearings as required. If delays are caused by the conduct of the
parties, the expert must inform the ET, which has power to order
costs or even strike out the claim or response. The final report is sent
to the parties, who can ask the expert written questions to clarify the
factual basis of the report. Unless the ET agrees otherwise, the
parties have just one opportunity to ask these questions within 28
days of the report being sent, and must copy their questions to each
other.178 The expert must provide written answers within a further 28
days.

5.84

5.85

The independent expert’s opinion has no special status179 but an
ET may well find it very convincing simply because it is
independent. Nevertheless, the ET should form its own decision as to
whether the work is of equal value.
In large trade union backed cases, the parties tend to instruct their
own experts. The ET’s permission is needed, and the evidence will
be restricted to what is reasonably required.180 If an independent
expert is also instructed by the tribunal, the parties’ own experts
must make their assessment based on the same facts. They must
disclose their reports in advance of the hearing and answer written
questions within set timescales. Although the ET can choose whether
to follow the conclusion of the independent expert, in reality an
expert’s reasoning and conclusions can only be challenged by
another expert. This is why parties usually call their own experts at
the hearing. Another advantage is that the tribunal may decide not to
appoint an independent expert if there are already two other experts,
and this may make the process much quicker than having to wait for
ACAS to appoint an independent expert. However, it is expensive to
instruct an expert (the ET pays for the independent expert181) and
s/he will not have the same rights of access to the employer’s
premises and to interview the woman or her comparators. These
matters will need negotiation between the parties, and reciprocal
access should be agreed.

Remedies, audits and time limits for claiming
Remedies
5.86

Remedies in equal pay cases involving an equality clause (ie all
those except any EqA 2010 s13 hypothetical comparator claims) are
different from those applying to other discrimination.182 In nonpensions cases, if an ET finds there has been a breach of an equality
clause, the disputed term in her contract is deemed modified and any
beneficial term in her comparator’s contract which is not in her own
becomes included in her contract (see para 5.58). The ET can also
make a declaration as to the rights of the parties and award pay

5.87

5.88

arrears or compensation in relation to any non-pay term.183 If the
employer is able to provide a material factor defence for only part of
the pay differential, the claim will succeed, but the remedy will be
only for the unjustified part. Under Article 157 (see para 5.1), a parttimer suffering indirect discrimination may have her contract
modified so that she receives proportionally the same benefits as
full-timers.184 The ET will need evidence of the differential between
the pay of the claimant and her comparator(s) for the whole arrears
period. It is advisable to ask the ET at an early case management
stage for an order that such information be provided by the
respondents. Otherwise by the remedy stage, the information may no
longer be available.
In England and Wales, a woman can claim arrears of remuneration
or damages for up to six years from the start of ET proceedings; in
Scotland it is only five years.185 There are special rules where the
woman had an incapacity or where the employer deliberately
concealed relevant information.186 Obviously a woman cannot claim
arrears for a period before she was employed or before the
particular comparator was employed. Where the woman’s claim is
based on work rated as equivalent under a JES, she cannot claim pay
arrears for a period prior to the date of the scheme.187 For any
earlier period, she may have to bring an equal value claim.
Remedies in respect of pension cases are more complicated and
dealt with by EqA 2010 ss133–134. Bear in mind the potential effect
of pre-claim ACAS early conciliation (EC) on arrears as EC delays
the start of ET proceedings. Although untested, EC could well impact
on the arrears period in certain circumstances, eg if the woman has
more recently left or ceased to be underpaid. This may be a reason to
bring EC to an early end.
ETs have power to award interest on pay arrears188 and are
prepared to do so. This partly counters the effect of the delays in the
ET procedure, so advisers should always seek interest on any claim
or settlement. Interest runs from a date midway between the initial
breach of the EqA 2010 and the calculation date by the ET.189 An
award for injury to feelings cannot be made in respect of a breach of

an equality clause.190 Unlike other discrimination claims, there is no
power for the ET to make recommendations.

Equal pay audits
An ET can order employers who lose equal pay cases in the ET to
carry out and publish equal pay audits.191 Micro-businesses with
fewer than ten employees immediately before the date of judgment
and new businesses which started up in the 12 months prior to the
date of the complaint are exempt.192 The idea of the audit is to
identify action to be taken to avoid equal pay breaches occurring or
continuing.193 Although the ET must order an audit where it finds an
equal pay breach, there are so many exceptions that the power is
considerably weakened. An audit must not be ordered in any of these
circumstances:

5.89

•

if there is no reason to think from the particular breach in the proceedings that there may
be other equal pay breaches;

•

if it is clear without an audit whether any action is required to avoid future equal pay
breaches;

•

if the information is already available from an audit in the previous three years; or

•

if the disadvantages of an audit would outweigh its benefits.194

The ET will set the ambit of the audit, specifying the categories of
employee to whom the relevant gender pay information must be
included and the relevant period of time. The audit must then:
•

include the relevant gender pay information for those employees;

•

identify any pay differences between the male and female employees and the reason for
the differences;

•

include the reasons for any equal pay breach identified by the audit; and

•

include the employer’s plan to avoid equal pay breaches occurring or continuing.195

The ET will specify a date for receipt of the completed audit which
is no sooner than three months from the order.196 If the tribunal does
not receive the audit on the ordered date or is not satisfied that it
meets the requirements, it will invite the employer to attend a hearing
and explain. If the employer has not yet provided the audit, it will be

5.90

given the opportunity to do so prior to the hearing date.197 If the
tribunal decides after the hearing that there is no audit or it does not
comply with the requirements, it must make an order that the
employer supply or amend the audit (as applicable) by a new date,
and consider imposing a penalty of up to £5,000 if there was no
reasonable excuse for non-compliance.198 If the employer continues
to fail, there can be additional penalties up to £5,000 on each
occasion.
Once the ET has confirmed the audit is satisfactory, within 28 days
the employer must publish the audit by telling everyone who is
covered by it where they can get a copy and, if the employer has a
website, putting it on the site for at least three years.199 ‘Website’ is
not defined, but seems to envisage a public site as opposed to an
intranet. The ET must be sent evidence that this has been done.
Modifications can be made if publication would involve breach of
any legal obligation, but an explanation must be sent to the ET.
Presumably this means that where there are concerns about breach of
confidentiality and data protection legislation, statistics could be
published on an anonymous basis. The difficulty sometimes will be
that individuals are still identifiable, eg because the employer is
small or there are unique job titles.

Time limits
5.91

5.92

The time limit for lodging equal pay claims concerning breach of an
equality clause or rule is set out in detail in EqA 2010 ss129–130.
There is no ‘just and equitable’ extension rule for late claims of the
type available for other types of discrimination claim. Equality
clause claims must be brought within the ‘qualifying period’. In a
‘standard case’, this means six months beginning with the last day on
which the woman was employed in the employment. A standard case
is any case which does not fall within the categories of a ‘stable
work case’, a concealment case or an incapacity case, as described
below.200
A woman needs to be careful about arguing that she falls under the
‘standard case’ category. If her contract is varied in some minor

5.93

respect during her employment, eg to reduce hours, but she is issued
with and signs new contract documentation at that time, her previous
employment may be taken to have come to an end for the purposes of
triggering the equal pay time limit.201 It may not be obvious whether
a change in contract terms amounts to the imposition of a new
contract (thus ending her previous ‘employment’ and causing time
limit problems) or is simply a variation in the existing one. It
depends on what the parties intended, which may not be easy to work
out. The fact that the change is fundamental may indicate a new
contract has been imposed, but on the other hand, an employee can
expressly or impliedly agree to vary a contract, even
fundamentally.202 If there is no agreement to a variation and the
change is fundamental, there is probably a termination and a new
contract. However, if a change is not fundamental, it is likely to be a
variation unless there was an express agreement to use the
mechanism of termination and a new contract.203
In many cases, the simpler solution to such a time limit problem is
to say that the woman’s continuing employment, despite new
contracts with varied terms, amounts to a ‘stable work case’. Indeed
this may be a better starting point than the ‘standard case’ category.
This is because, in a stable work case, the six months runs from the
end of the relationship, not from the end of a particular contract. A
stable work case is one where there was a ‘stable working
relationship’ between the worker and the employer, including any
time after the terms of work had expired.204 It is not completely clear
what amounts to a stable work relationship, but it basically refers to
the nature of the work rather than technicalities regarding whether
there were different contracts or not.205 It can therefore include a
situation where the same work is carried out for the same employer
over a period of time through a series of successive contracts,
whether short or long-term contracts, and whether or not there is a
break between them.206 For example, where such contracts are
concluded at regular intervals in respect of the same employment and
with the same pension scheme, time would run from the end of such a
stable work relationship. An unknown question is whether any

5.94

5.95

change in the nature of the work or the woman’s status breaks a
stable work relationship, eg if she moves from fixed-term contracts
to a permanent position, or is promoted to a higher grade.207 It is
worth remembering that the ‘stable work case’ category was called a
‘stable employment relationship’ under the EqPA 1970, and the caselaw developed on the basis of the latter wording, which may be more
restrictive. If there are intermittent contracts without a stable work
relationship, time runs from the end of each contract.
There are special rules where the woman had an incapacity or
where the employer deliberately concealed relevant information,
without which the woman could not reasonably have been expected
to start a case.208 Where there has been a TUPE transfer, the time
limit for any claim in respect of the period of employment with the
transferor should be counted from the transfer date.209 This is so
even if liability for the underpayment transfers to the transferee under
the TUPE rules. However, where the transferee continues to act in
breach of an equality clause, eg by inheriting a contractual liability to
increase pay to that of a male comparator, time runs from the end of
the relevant employment with the transferee with regard to underpay
in the post-transfer period.210 When NHS Trusts are dissolved and
the woman’s employment is taken over by another body, it is likely
that the time limit runs from the dissolution date.211 There are
different time limit rules in armed forces cases.212
Because equal pay claims are so complex, it does happen in the
large claims that the correct comparators are not identified in the
original tribunal claim form. The problem with amending to add new
comparator jobs later is that this is regarded as adding a new cause
of action, even if the existing claim is on the same basis, ie like work
or work rated as equivalent or work of equal value.213 However, it
seems that if the amendment is only to substitute another named
individual carrying out the same or substantially the same job as the
original comparator, there is no new cause of action and the
amendment can be allowed.214 The date from which the arrears
period is counted (see para 5.87) will also be affected according to
whether or not it is a new cause of action.

5.96

5.97

Direct sex discrimination based on a hypothetical comparison as
opposed to sex equality clause cases are brought under EqA 2010
s13 and one assumes the time limit rules would be as for direct
discrimination generally (see chapter 21). ACAS EC applies to
either type of tribunal claim.215
Equal pay cases can in some circumstances be brought in a civil
court as opposed to in an ET. This is not usually desirable because
of the increased costs involved and because ETs are more familiar
with such claims. One of the main reasons for doing so may be if the
ET time limits are missed, since civil courts have much longer time
limits. However, it is not purely a matter of choice. A court can
strike out an equal pay claim if it would ‘more conveniently’ be
brought in an ET.216 The fact that the shorter tribunal time limits have
been missed means a claim cannot be brought more conveniently in
an ET and it will probably be allowed as a civil claim, provided
there was no deliberate abuse of process going on.217 Nevertheless,
this route should never be relied on as a reason for letting an ET time
limit pass. Not only might a court decide that it was an abuse of
process to deliberately miss a time limit because of some idea that
having a civil court case will lead to a litigation advantage, it is also
a more expensive course of action.

Chapter 6: Key points
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Only employees can claim unfair dismissal. To decide whether
a worker is an employee, the label and tax position are not
conclusive. The key tests are mutual obligation to give and
undertake work, and control by the employer.
Agency workers may or may not be employees of either the
agency or the client organisation (end-user). In the latter case,
the key test is whether it is necessary to imply a contract
between the worker and the end-user to explain their working
relationship.
For ordinary unfair dismissal, employees must have at least
two years’ service. Certain breaks in service do not in fact
break continuity of employment.
A dismissal may be substantively unfair (why the employee
was dismissed) or procedurally unfair (how the employee was
dismissed).
The Polkey principle applies, ie it can be an unfair dismissal
purely because unfair dismissal procedures were followed
(though compensation will be reduced if there is no substantive
unfairness – see chapter 18).
It is not against the law in itself for an employer to fail to follow
a relevant part of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) Code of Practice on Disciplinary and
Grievance Procedures, but the tribunal must take it into
account. Compensation can also be increased or reduced by
up to 25 per cent for either party’s unreasonable failure to
follow the Code.
There are special rules where an employee is dismissed
during industrial action, depending on whether or not the action
was official. Workers must not be subjected to a detriment to
prevent or deter them from going on strike.

There are a large and growing number of grounds on which
dismissal is automatically unfair. Most but not all of these
grounds do not require any minimum service.
It is also unlawful to subject employees to a detriment other
than dismissal on most but not all of these grounds.
In respect of many of these grounds, it is unlawful to subject a
worker (as well as an employee) to a detriment other than or
including dismissal. This is usually where the substantive right
being protected is given to workers generally.
Many of the grounds for automatic unfair dismissal or
detriment are to ensure employees/workers are not victimised
for asserting their rights, eg to a minimum wage, under the
Working Time Regulations or for payslips. The law and
evidence required is similar in some respects to that for
victimisation under the discrimination legislation.1
Workers must not be subjected to a detriment because they
refuse to work in circumstances of danger, which they
reasonably believe to be serious and imminent. This may apply
where there are dangers of catching Covid-19.
Workers must not be subjected to a detriment for
whistleblowing in the correct manner.
This chapter should be read in conjunction with chapter 22 on
fair disciplinary procedures.

The legal framework
6.1

6.2

The statutory right not to be unfairly dismissed was first introduced
by the Industrial Relations Act 1971. It is now contained in the
Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996. The right not to be unfairly
dismissed is closely linked to the fair handling of disciplinary
hearings. Chapter 22 deals with disciplinaries and grievances.
The ERA 1996 contains many of the most common statutory
employment rights belonging to individuals, apart from the
discrimination legislation. As well as unfair dismissal, it includes

6.3

notice entitlement, redundancy, the rights to payslips and written
particulars, unauthorised deductions from wages and some maternity
rights. There are separate regulations dealing with such matters as
working time, the minimum wage and transfers. Most collective trade
union laws and rights of workers to belong to trade unions are
contained in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation)
Act (TULR(C)A) 1992.
There are a number of codes of practice in employment law issued
by various specialist bodies including the Advisory, Conciliation
and Arbitration Service (ACAS). Generally speaking, these codes
are not legally enforceable in themselves, but provide guidance
which the tribunals and courts must take into account. The ACAS
Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures sets out
good practice guidelines for the handling of disciplinary and
grievance issues in employment.2 This code is often referred to in
unfair dismissal cases, where procedures prior to dismissal are
important (see para 6.64).

Who can claim unfair dismissal?
Eligible categories
Employees and the self-employed
6.4

6.5

In order to claim unfair dismissal, a worker must be employed (ie
work under a contract of employment or service). A worker who is
self-employed (ie working under a contract for services) is not
entitled to bring a claim. The distinction between these two types of
worker can be extremely blurred and difficult to distinguish.
Unfortunately, there is no clear guidance given by the tribunals and
courts to distinguish between those who are employed and those who
are simply a worker or even self-employed. An ‘employee’ is
defined in the ERA 1996 simply as someone who has entered into, or
works under, a contract of employment.3 A ‘contract of employment’
means ‘a contract of service or apprenticeship, whether express or
implied, and (if it is express), whether it is oral or in writing’.4 A

checklist which summarises the following text is in appendix A at
A14.
There is no single test which determines whether an individual is
an employee, although there have been a large number of cases trying
to establish the approach to be adopted to determine this issue. It is
not enough that a person looked like an employee, acted like an
employee and was treated as an employee.5 The test is more
technical than that. The usual starting point is to consider the three
criteria in the Ready Mixed Concrete case (admittedly expressed in
rather old-fashioned terms):6

6.6

•

in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, the ‘servant’ agrees to provide his own
work and skill in the performance of some service for ‘his master’;

•

the servant agrees to be under the other’s control to a sufficient degree to make the other a
master;

•
6.7

the other provisions in the contract are consistent with it being a contract of employment.

There cannot be a contract of employment if there is not at least some
level of mutual obligation to supply and perform work. This is often
referred to as ‘an irreducible minimum of obligation on each side’.7
For example, even if the employer is not obliged to offer a particular
number of hours, s/he must be obliged to offer at least a reasonable
amount of work, or to offer work if it becomes available, or to pay a
retainer if there is no work. Equally, the individual must be obliged
to accept work if it is offered, or at least to accept a reasonable
amount of work. It can be difficult to apply these legal principles in
practice because it is not always easy to analyse what the contractual
obligations are. In one case,8 butlers who worked in a hotel as
‘regular casuals’ were not employees, even though they were
provided with work on a regular basis, since the hotel was not under
an obligation to provide such work. In a later case, power station
guides were held not to be employees because the employer had no
obligation to provide work and the workers were free to accept or
refuse any work which was in fact offered.9 By contrast, in another
case, homeworkers were found to be employees, even though they
could decide how much work they took on. This was because they

6.8

6.9

had to accept at least a reasonable amount of work so that it was
worthwhile for the delivery drivers to call, and the employer in turn
had to provide a reasonable share of the available work to each
homeworker.10 Whether there is sufficient mutual obligation for a
worker on a zero hours contract11 to be an employee is an important
question. These cases, although arising before that terminology
became widespread, provide useful guidance.
It is also essential to being an employee that the employer has a
sufficient framework of ‘control’ over the worker, although this can
be ambiguous because direct supervision and control is absent in
many kinds of employment today.12 If the worker controls when,
where and how s/he performs the work, this degree of autonomy
would suggest that s/he is self-employed. However, if the employer
has the contractual power to tell the worker when, where and how to
perform, it would indicate that the worker is an employee, whether
or not the worker has day-to-day control over his/her own work.13
Personal service is also an essential requirement. As stated in Ready
Mixed Concrete (see para 6.6), the individual must have agreed to
provide his/her own work and skill. This means it is unlikely to be a
contract of employment if the individual has an unfettered power to
send someone else along to do the work in his/her place, ie a power
of ‘substitution’. But a limited power to send a substitute, eg only
when the individual is unable (as opposed to unwilling) to work
and/or only if the substitute is approved by the employer, is not
necessarily inconsistent with the individual being obliged to provide
personal service.14
Although lack of mutual obligation, an insufficient right of control
by the employer, and an individual’s right to send substitutes are all
factors which are highly likely to prevent there being a contract of
employment, the converse does not mean there definitely is a contract
of employment. The other provisions of the contract must also be
consistent with its being a contract of employment. It is useful to look
at how integrated the individual is into the business. It is helpful,
though not conclusive in itself, if s/he is very much part of the
organisation. The employment tribunal (ET) will also look at the

6.10

purpose of the contract and what the parties intended when they
formed it. It is the nature of the agreement and the actual performance
of the contract which counts, not simply the label attached to the
relationship by the parties. Just because an individual is told by an
employer that s/he is self-employed does not mean that is the true
legal position. Nor is it conclusive that s/he is paying tax on a selfemployed basis, although that will be one of the relevant factors.15
The method and mode of payment of wages may also be relevant. If
pay is referable to a period of time rather than productivity, this
suggests that the individual is more likely to be an employee. S/he is
also more likely to be an employee if s/he gets paid sick leave and is
subject to the usual disciplinary and grievance procedures.
The above assumes that it is clear what the contract terms are, but
this may not be the case. When deciding what terms have been
agreed between the parties, the written contract is not the starting
point.16 Employment contracts are not like other types of contract.
The important point is whether individuals qualify for employment
rights by meeting the statutory definition of ‘worker’ and ‘employee’.
The danger with relying too much on what is in a written contract is
that employers are often in a position to dictate the terms. Workers
sometimes sign pro forma contracts which are designed to prevent
them being an employee, eg by stating there is no mutual obligation to
offer or perform work, or that the worker has the right to send along
a substitute. This does not mean that the terms of any written
agreement should be ignored, because the evidence might show that
the parties really did understand and agree to those terms. But the
written document is just one factor. The tribunal will look at all the
evidence to see what the true nature of the relationship was.17 This
will not necessarily be contained in an explicit verbal agreement, but
it can be implied from the circumstances. For example, a contract
might state there is a right to send along a substitute, but is that really
what the employer agreed, given the nature of the work and the
employer’s requirements? Or the contract may state that the
employee can refuse work at any time, but does the way the business
is organised suggest it could really run on that basis? The behaviour

6.11

of the parties in practice can be a good guide, but it can also be
misleading. For example, just because the individual never tried to
send along a substitute does not mean s/he did not have the right to
do so. It would be far more significant if the individual did try to
send along a substitute one day and was refused. That would suggest
there was no such agreement in the first place. When deciding
whether a written contract is a true reflection of the parties’
agreement, tribunals must be realistic and worldly wise. They must
be alive to the concern that armies of lawyers will simply place
clauses denying mutual obligation as a matter of form even when
such terms do not begin to reflect the relationship.18 To override an
express clause by proving it is a sham, the tribunal must be
convinced that the real agreement was to a different effect, but there
does not need to have been any intent to deceive third parties.19
‘Contract workers’, ‘temps’, ‘casuals’, workers on zero hours
contracts,20 people working freelance, agency workers or, less
likely, volunteers, may or may not meet the definition of an
‘employee’. If these workers are ‘employees’ and meet the other
eligibility requirements (see below), they can claim unfair dismissal.
With volunteers, the key factor is whether there is a mutual obligation
to provide and attend work, not whether the volunteer has obligations
and standards to meet while at work.21

Sometimes an employee is not required to work all the time, but only
as and when required on individual engagements. Zero hours
contracts may fall within this category. In such situations, it is very
possible that the individual engagements, once accepted, would in
themselves amount to self-contained contracts of employment. For
example, a teacher employed on a series of individual short-term
contracts can be an employee for the period of each individual
contract, even if there is no obligation to grant him/her each new
contract.22 There is no minimum length of such contracts, which
could even come into effect on a daily basis.23 The fact that the
employer or employee can terminate the contract during the

individual engagement does not in itself prevent it being a contract of
employment.24 The only problem for workers wanting to claim unfair
dismissal will be acquiring sufficient length of service if the
contracts are short and there are gaps in between.25 The worker then
needs to argue either that the rules on continuous service allow for
the separate contracts to be added together (see below) or that there
is in fact an overarching ‘global’ or ‘umbrella’ contract, which
covers the time when the employee is not working, as well as the
times when s/he is employed on the individual engagements. To be
able to prove that the contract of employment continues throughout in
this way, there must be ‘an irreducible minimum of obligation’ which
continues through the breaks in work engagements.26
Agency workers
6.13

Agency workers may in theory be employees of the organisation to
which they are assigned (the ‘end-user’) or of the agency which
assigns them27 (or neither). If in genuine doubt, the employee should
bring a case against both.28 The usual tests of mutual obligation and
control apply when deciding whether the worker is an employee of
either party.29 However, when considering whether the worker is an
employee of the end-user, the more important question is whether
there is any contract at all between the worker and the end-user.
Usually there is no express contract between them, so the issue
becomes whether a contract can be implied. A contract can only be
implied if it is necessary to do so, to give business reality to the fact
that the end-user provides work and the worker carries it out. The
problem is that in most cases, this arrangement can be explained by
the express agreements between the end-user and the agency, and
between the worker and the agency – it is not necessary to imply any
contract between the end-user and the worker.30 It needs some
specific words or action to convince a tribunal that the agency
arrangements no longer explain the relationship. The fact that the
arrangement has been going on for a long time is not enough on its
own, as it is explicable by mutual convenience. It may be easiest to
imply a contract of employment when agency arrangements are

6.14

superimposed on an existing direct contractual arrangement.31 It is
useful to look at the written agreements between the agency and the
worker,32 and the agency and the end-user, although it is not enough
simply to look at the label applied to the situation in the documents.33
A contract of employment can be implied between the worker and
the end-user even if the contract between the worker and the agency
expressly stipulates there is no such contract of employment,34 but as
already explained, it is difficult to imply such contracts.
A worker can be an employee of an agency in respect of a single
assignment or placement, even if s/he is not an employee of the
agency overall.35 If the worker has accepted a series of individual
assignments with the same or different end-users, the question then
becomes whether s/he can add together the assignments and maintain
continuity between any gaps, so that s/he qualifies to claim unfair
dismissal against the agency. Where a worker has an express contract
of employment with an agency, it is unlikely (though not impossible)
that s/he is also an employee of the end-user.36
Upper age limit

6.15

There is no longer an upper age limit for claiming unfair dismissal. It
used to be possible to force employees to retire at or above the age
of 65 or any lower, objectively justifiable, normal retirement age, if
the correct procedures were followed. However, those rules were
phased out with effect from 6 April 2011.
Working abroad and ship workers

6.16

Employees can claim unfair dismissal if they were working in Great
Britain (GB) at the time of their dismissal. A peripatetic employee,
eg a pilot with a base in GB, can also be covered. Where an
employee lives and/or works for at least part of the time in GB, it is
only necessary for his/her connection with the system of law in GB
to be ‘sufficiently strong’ for it to be appropriate for a tribunal to
deal with the claim. Where an employee lives and works wholly
abroad, s/he can only claim in exceptional circumstances and it is
necessary to identify factors which are sufficiently powerful to

displace the more obvious connection with the foreign jurisdiction.
The employee will need to show s/he has a much stronger connection
both with GB and with British employment law than with any other
system of law. It is the degree of connection which is relevant. The
relative merits of the competing systems of law are irrelevant. An
example of an employee who could be covered might be an
employee who is posted abroad for the purposes of a business
carried on in GB, as opposed to a business carried out abroad albeit
for British owners. For example, a foreign correspondent on the staff
of a British newspaper, who is posted abroad and lives there for
many years but remains nevertheless a permanent employee of the
newspaper who could be posted to some other country. Another
example could be an employee living and working effectively in a
British enclave abroad, eg a military base.37 Special rules apply to
employment on a ship.38

Categories excluded from claiming unfair dismissal
Overview
6.17

Employees in Crown employment (eg working for government
departments) can generally claim unfair dismissal, though there are
some partial exceptions with regard to certain of the grounds for
automatic unfair dismissal in relation to members of the armed
services or for employment in the Security Service.39 Members of
the police service are generally excluded.40 There are certain other
special categories.41 Advisers should check the exact wording of the
legislation and up-to-date amendments where any of these exclusions
may apply. Special rules also apply to employees of foreign and
Commonwealth missions.42 Whether a church minister is an
employee and can therefore claim unfair dismissal depends on the
facts and nature of his/her duties and, most importantly, whether there
was an intention to create legal relations.43 Under Article 9 of the
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (freedom of
religion) a tribunal must take it into account if the church in the
particular case does not believe in creating legal relations.

Contracting out
It is a very important principle that employees cannot agree to give
up their right to claim unfair dismissal.44 The only exceptions are
where they have settled their claim through ACAS or in a ‘settlement
agreement’ (formerly called compromise agreement).45 In addition,
there is the controversial category of ‘employee shareholders’ who
can give up their right to claim ordinary unfair dismissal (see para
6.130).

6.18

Illegal contracts of employment
An employment tribunal claim may fail on grounds of ‘illegality’.
This may be ‘statutory illegality’ where legislation prohibits the
contract or a particular term, or ‘common law illegality’, where the
formation, purpose or performance of the contract involves conduct
that is illegal or contrary to public policy and where it is therefore
appropriate for the courts to deny enforcement of the contract to one
or other party. A tribunal should consider the public interests at stake
and consider whether denying the claim would be a proportionate
response to the illegality. Potentially relevant factors include the
seriousness of the conduct, its centrality to the contract, whether it
was intentional and whether there was a marked disparity in the
parties’ respective culpability.46 The law on illegality is difficult and
inconsistent. It is not helped by the most recent Supreme Court
decision on the matter not being an employment case.47 This section
can only offer a few pointers. Where illegality is a potential
problem, it is necessary to read the case-law. These are the most
common types of illegality in employment cases:

6.19

•

The most obvious example of statutory illegality is where an employee is not entitled to
enter or work in the UK under the immigration rules.48 This may prevent the worker
bringing a claim, but not necessarily if eg the worker was vulnerable, unaware the rules had
been broken, and the wording of the immigration legislation does not categorically make the
contract void.

•

The most typical type of ‘common law illegality’ is where, with the employee’s
involvement, there has been a fraud on HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), eg the

employer is not paying the appropriate income tax on the employee’s wages. A common
indication of a fraud is when wages are wholly or partly in cash and payslips are inaccurate
or non-existent. The employee must have known the facts (although not necessarily that
anything was against the law). Moreover, the employee must have actively participated in
the fraud, not just turned a blind eye.49
•

It does not make a contract illegal to wrongly describe it as self-employment and to pay tax
on that basis, if the parties are in good faith and have not misrepresented the facts to
HMRC.50

•

Where the performance of the employment contract is illegal at certain times, the
prohibited period will not count towards the required length of continuous employment for
an unfair dismissal claim. An employee must be continuously employed for two years after
the end of the prohibited period in order to qualify for the general protection against unfair
dismissal.51

•

The rules on illegality are more flexible for discrimination claims.52

Qualifying service
Length of continuous employment
6.20

To claim unfair dismissal, an employee must have been continuously
employed for at least two years at the effective date of termination
(EDT) of his/her contract of employment.53 The qualifying period
has changed several times in the past. In June 1999, it was reduced
from two years to one year, and it was increased back to two years
by the coalition government in April 2012. There also used to be a
requirement to work at least 16 hours per week to qualify for the
right not to be unfairly dismissed. This was found to be indirect sex
discrimination contrary to EU law, and the minimum hours
requirement was removed in 1995. There is no minimum length of
service requirement for dismissals related to an employee’s political
opinions or affiliation or connected with the employee’s membership
of a reserve force54 or for certain automatic unfair dismissals, eg
where dismissal is related to pregnancy or maternity.55
Weeks which count towards continuous service

Continuous employment is measured by ‘qualifying’ weeks.56 Any
week during all or part of which the employee’s relations with
his/her employer are governed by a contract of employment is a
week which counts. If during all or part of a week a worker is away
on account of holiday or sickness or other recognised absence, that
week will nevertheless count if the contract of employment is still
running. Equally, if an employee resigns or is dismissed in one week
and re-engaged in the subsequent week, each week counts and
continuity is not broken. In certain circumstances, there can also be
continuous service once a contract of employment is agreed but the
start date has not yet arrived,57 but it may be risky to rely on this.
Continuous service is broken by a week that does not qualify with the
result that the employee will have to start again in accruing the two
years’ continuous service.58 Days spent on a strike,59 whether
official or unofficial, do not count towards continuous service.
However, the period on strike does not break continuity either. The
effect is simply to push forward the date when the employee’s
continuous service is considered to have started by the relevant
number of days.60

6.21

Continuity if the employee leaves work and returns
The period of continuous employment must be of unbroken service
except in limited circumstances. As already stated, where an
employee is absent from work but the contract continues, there is no
problem and continuity is preserved. In some circumstances, even
though the contract is terminated because the employee leaves, when
s/he subsequently returns to the job continuity is preserved and the
weeks of absence will count towards his/her continuity of
employment. Continuity is preserved where the contract of
employment is not in existence and the employee is absent from work
in any of the following circumstances:

6.22

•

on account of a temporary cessation of work. This is when the employer lays off
employees through lack of work.61 It can also cover regular breaks between contracts, eg
teachers who are contracted from September to July every year but not over the
summer.62 Whether a break can be considered ‘temporary’ may not be clear;63

•

because of sickness or injury, subject to a maximum of 26 weeks;64

•

in such circumstances that, by arrangement or custom, the employee is regarded as
continuing in employment for all or any purposes.65 This can be helpful when, eg, an
employer agrees that an employee may leave to visit family overseas and return
subsequently to the same employment. At the outset, both parties must regard the
employee as continuing in employment for the entire period of the absence.66 An
arrangement cannot be entered after the absence to confer continuity retrospectively.67
Women taking advantage of child-break schemes need to be extremely careful about the
terms of the scheme so they do not lose continuity.68 Ideally they should simply take unpaid
extended leave, without terminating their employment at all;

•

the employee is reinstated or re-engaged through ACAS conciliation following dismissal, or
a settlement agreement, or as a result of bringing an ET claim, eg through a reinstatement
or re-engagement order made by the ET, or as a result of a decision taken arising out of the
use of the (now abolished) statutory dispute resolution or age and retirement procedures.69

The presumption of continuity
6.23

The period of continuous employment begins on the day the
employee starts work70 and is presumed to continue71 until the EDT
of the contract of employment.72 The presumption of continuity is
very important for employees, since it means that it is for the
employer to prove there has been a break which is not recognised by
the law as preserving continuity.73
Identifying the effective date of termination

6.24

The EDT is identified in the same way as for time limit purposes74
except that, for the purposes of calculating length of continuous
service, it is artificially extended when the employer fails to give
notice. In those circumstances, the EDT is when the minimum
statutory notice period, not the contractual notice period, would have
expired.75 The EDT will not be extended if the employee was
dismissed without notice on grounds of gross misconduct and s/he
had in fact committed gross misconduct.76 The law on an employee’s
contractual rights is complicated where an employer, without
justification, dismisses him/her without notice and the employee then
refuses to accept that the dismissal has taken place. However, from

the point of view of the statutory right to claim unfair dismissal, this
does not affect the EDT in an unfair dismissal case.77
Transfer of the business and associated employers
Continuity of employment is preserved where there has been a
transfer of the business.78 For the general effect of TUPE, see chapter
10. Continuity is also preserved if, at the time the employee starts
work for a new employer, the new employer is an ‘associated’
employer of the original employer. Companies are associated
employers if one company directly or indirectly controls the other, or
if both companies are under the control of a third person.79 Any gap
in service between the old and new employers may be preserved by
the usual rules (para 6.22 above).80

6.25

‘Contract workers’, ‘casuals’, ‘temps’ and ‘zero hours
workers’
With the deregulation of the labour market, workers are employed on
an increasingly insecure basis under a number of labels which have
no legal meaning. Whether or not ‘contract workers’, ‘casuals’,
‘temps’ and ‘zero hours workers’ can claim unfair dismissal depends
on whether they meet the eligibility requirements set out in this
chapter. In particular:

6.26

•

Are they employees? This is a question of fact having regard, in particular, to the issues of
mutual obligation and how much control the employer exercises (see paras 6.4–6.14).

•

Do they have the requisite length of service? Remember that a series of fixed-term
contracts without a break which counts will be added together.

•

Have they been dismissed? Failure to renew a fixed-term contract is a dismissal in law.

•

It is no longer possible to exclude the right to claim unfair dismissal on expiry of fixed-term
contracts by written waiver clauses.81 Whether or not the failure to renew a fixed-term
contract is in practice fair or unfair, will be subject to the usual reasonableness test (see
below). However, it cannot necessarily be assumed that just because the contract was for
a fixed-term period, non-renewal is fair.

What is a dismissal?

To bring a claim for unfair dismissal, the employee must have been
dismissed in a way recognised by the ERA 1996.82 There are
various types of dismissal:

6.27

•

termination by the employer;

•

expiry of a fixed-term contract;

•

forced resignation;

•

resignation amounting to constructive dismissal.

Termination by the employer
6.28

6.29

6.30

Usually the employer terminates the employment with or without
notice. Notice of dismissal occurs when there is an ascertainable
date, not merely advance warning. If an employee resigns simply
because s/he has been warned of a future dismissal, s/he cannot
claim actual or constructive dismissal.
Sometimes there is an argument where an employer uses
ambiguous words, which the employee may understand as a
dismissal, but the employer later denies s/he said at all or that they
meant any more than ‘Go home for the rest of the day’. If there is a
dispute over whether a dismissal has occurred, the onus is on the
employee to show on the balance of probabilities that s/he has been
dismissed. If the ET cannot decide this issue on the available
evidence, the employee’s claim will fail.83 If the employee cannot
prove s/he was dismissed, the tribunal will say s/he resigned and has
no rights. However, if the employer’s behaviour amounted to a
fundamental breach of contract, the employee may be able to claim
constructive dismissal instead.
Where the employer’s words are ambiguous, the ET will look at
the purpose and effect of those words in the light of all the
surrounding circumstances and, in particular, the conduct of the
parties and what happened before and after the disputed dismissal.84
The ET must then decide how a ‘reasonable’ employee would have
interpreted the employer’s words.85 On the other hand, if the
employer’s words clearly indicated a dismissal, and are taken at
face value, the dismissal probably stands even if the employer did

6.31

6.32

not mean to dismiss and a reasonable listener would have understood
that.86 The situation is different where the dismissal (or resignation)
took place in ‘the heat of the moment’, for example, as a result of an
argument between the employer and employee.87 If the employer
retracts the dismissal soon afterwards, the ET may consider that s/he
was entitled to do so and that if the employee refuses to come back,
s/he has in fact resigned. The period of time in which a party may
retract depends on the circumstances, but usually it should be shortly
afterwards.
A similar principle applies where an employee resigns in the heat
of the moment and instantly retracts the resignation. If the employer
refuses to accept the retraction, the ET may consider the employee to
have been dismissed. Similarly, where the employee is immature or
of below average intelligence and resigns while under emotional
stress, the ET will not necessarily treat those words as constituting a
resignation, if the employee never intended it.88
An employee who wants to leave before his/her notice expires, eg
to start a new job, must be careful as s/he could lose his/her right to
claim unfair dismissal. If his/her employer agrees to the employee
leaving early, the dismissal almost certainly still counts as a
dismissal in law.89 If the employer refuses to agree, the employee
must give counter-notice in accordance with ERA 1996 s95(2),
though it is not completely clear how this works.90 For where an
employee is offered reinstatement after an internal appeal, see para
22.24.

Expiry of a fixed-term contract
6.33

Non-renewal of a fixed-term contract on its expiry is treated as a
dismissal.91 A fixed-term contract is a contract for a specific term
and at its commencement the termination date is ascertainable.92

Forced resignation
6.34

If the employee resigns as a result of the employer saying that s/he
must resign or otherwise be dismissed, this counts as a dismissal.93

The difficult issue for the ET to decide is whether the resignation
was forced. An employee should be wary of resigning in these
circumstances, because it may be difficult to prove that s/he was
threatened in this way.

Constructive dismissal
Overview
There is much confusion among the public about the meaning of
‘constructive dismissal’.94 Constructive dismissal occurs when an
employee resigns (with or without giving notice) because of a
‘fundamental’ or ‘repudiatory’ breach of the employment contract by
the employer. In order to bring an unfair dismissal case, an employee
still needs to meet the other eligibility criteria, eg length of service.
S/he will also have to prove the constructive dismissal was unfair.
Constructive dismissal is usually difficult to prove with lots of
pitfalls, and an employee should be very careful about resigning if
s/he wants to be able to claim unfair dismissal.
For constructive dismissal, the employer must have broken the
contract and it is not enough that s/he simply acted unreasonably.95
So, for example, if the employer gives the employee an instruction
which is unreasonable but which is allowed by the contract, there is
no breach of contract and therefore no constructive dismissal.
However, extremely unreasonable behaviour might breach the
implied contract term of trust and confidence (see below).
Before resigning, an employee needs to consider which contract
term the employer has broken. This means being sure what the
contract says on the point in dispute. Contracts consist of express
terms (verbal or written), which are sometimes ambiguously
worded, and unwritten implied terms, which can be even more
uncertain. Many constructive dismissal claims rely on the employer’s
breach of one of the generally implied terms, for example:

6.35

6.36

6.37

•

not to subject the employee to capricious or arbitrary treatment;

•

not to break trust and confidence;

•

to take reasonable care for the employee’s health and safety.96

It can be particularly difficult to know when such an implied term
has been broken in practice. Examples of breach of the implied term
of trust and confidence could be:
•

persistent and unwanted amorous advances towards a female employee;97

•

failure to investigate properly the employee’s allegations of sexual harassment;98

•

undermining a supervisor by reprimanding him/her in the presence of subordinates;99

•

swearing abusively at the employee, unless such language is commonly used and directed
at each other by staff;100

•

most conduct which amounts to unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010,
but there will be exceptions;101

•

suspending an employee without reasonable and proper cause.102 However, employees
need to be very careful on this one because an employer usually needs less justification for
suspending an employee and investigating an allegation than for actually taking disciplinary
action.

The band of reasonable responses test (see para 6.60) does not apply
in constructive dismissal cases to the question whether the employer
has broken the implied term of trust and confidence.103
Fundamental breach of contract
6.38

The employee cannot resign unless the breach of contract is
‘fundamental’. There are no hard and fast rules on this, and it is for
the ET to decide what impact the breach has on the contractual
relationship of the parties. The working relationship will be relevant
and what in one job may amount to a fundamental breach, in another
will not. Many constructive dismissal cases arise when an employer
tries to vary the employee’s contract unilaterally, eg by substantial
cuts in pay or changes in hours or shifts. A serious change of
contractual job content or demotion can also be fundamental breach.
As noted above, in most cases, an act of discrimination by the
employer will amount to a fundamental breach of trust and
confidence. For example, in one case, an unjustifiable refusal to
allow a woman to work part-time on her return from maternity leave
together with refusal on grounds that she was a woman amounted to a
fundamental breach of trust and confidence.104

6.39

Sometimes a single breach of contract is enough if it is sufficiently
serious. Alternatively, the employee can rely on a series of breaches,
where each breach in isolation might not constitute a significant and
fundamental breach, but taken together they do. In certain
circumstances, an employee can resign over a relatively insignificant
final straw (see para 6.44 below).
An anticipatory breach

6.40

When an employer breaks a term of a contract with immediate effect,
this constitutes an actual breach. When the employer merely indicates
in advance a clear intention to commit a fundamental breach, this is
called an ‘anticipatory breach’. An employee who resigns as a result
of an anticipatory breach may claim constructive dismissal.105
However, an employee should be careful not to resign prematurely
where the employer has not finally decided to commit the
fundamental breach. The employer may still be willing to negotiate.
For example, an invitation to use the grievance procedure in
response to a proposed step will indicate that the employer has made
no final decision. Equally, an employer’s statement that, ‘I expect
you to co-operate in the manner asked of you’, is only a forceful
request, falling short of an actual breach of contract.
When to resign

6.41

Once the employee is sure that the employer has committed an actual
or anticipatory breach, s/he must resign fairly promptly, since any
delay may be taken by the ET as evidence that the employee has
really accepted the employer’s conduct. This is known as ‘affirming’
the contract or ‘waiving’ the breach.106 In theory, delay on its own is
not enough to amount to affirmation, but prolonged delay can suggest
implied affirmation, especially as there may easily be other
indicators. It is not the delay which may be fatal, but what happens
during the period of delay.107 For example, it may amount to
affirmation if the employee does anything to suggest that s/he still
wants to continue the contract, or if s/he asks the employer to take
actions under the contract. However, recognising the realities of the

6.42

6.43

6.44

employment situation, an employee can probably perform the
contract to a limited extent for a temporary period if s/he makes it
clear s/he does not accept the breach and wants it remedied.
How long an employee can afford to delay depends on the facts of
each case. A written objection or statement that the employee is
‘working under protest’ is not enough to keep his/her position open
indefinitely. An employee’s actions, by staying in the job, and even
changing his/her behaviour, speak louder than words. Delay is very
risky where the employer’s breach has immediate impact on the
employee, eg a pay cut, and particularly where the employee has to
behave differently to comply with the breach, eg new duties or
location. It may be legitimate to object in writing and request a short
trial period before resigning.108 There is less urgency where the
breach has no immediate impact, eg a change in retirement age or
sick pay entitlement, provided a written protest is made immediately.
An employee can probably delay long enough to establish the
nature of the breach and give the employer an opportunity to change
his/her mind, eg by negotiating or taking out a grievance. However,
the employee needs to be careful to object in writing from the outset,
not to be strung along for too long in pointless negotiations, and if
s/he gives an ultimatum, to stick to it.109 Equally, if the employee has
awaited the outcome of a lengthy grievance which is decided against
him/her, s/he needs to make up his/her mind very quickly afterwards.
It may be possible to avoid affirming while off sick and accepting
sick pay, but this depends on the general circumstances, eg the length
of the delay, how ill the employee is, whether the sickness was
caused by the employer’s behaviour, whether the employee is
repeating his/her rejection of the breach, whether s/he is carrying out
other parts of his/her contract, whether s/he is asking the employer to
carry out other parts of the contract etc.110
If an employee has affirmed an earlier breach of trust and
confidence, but the employer then carries out another objectionable
action, the employee can rely on the totality of the employer’s
behaviour when deciding to resign. This is known as the ‘last straw’
doctrine.111 The final act by the employer may be relatively

6.45

insignificant, though it cannot be completely trivial and must add
something, however slight, to the earlier incidents. It does not have
to be unreasonable or even blameworthy by the employer. It is an
objective test – a completely innocuous act by the employer cannot
be the last straw, even if the employee genuinely interprets it as
hurtful.
It usually works to follow through this checklist:112
1) What was the most recent action which triggered the employee’s resignation?
2) Has the employee affirmed the contract since that action?
3) If not, was the action sufficient to amount to a repudiatory breach in itself?
4) If not, was it nevertheless part of a series of actions which cumulatively amounted to a
repudiatory breach of trust and confidence? If so, it does not matter that there was a
previous affirmation.
5) Did the employee resign at least partly in response to that breach?

6.46

6.47

When the employee does resign, s/he should make it clear in writing
that it is in response to the employer’s fundamental breach and not
for any other reason. An employee is not prevented from bringing a
claim for constructive dismissal because no mention is made at the
time of resignation that it is a constructive dismissal, but it may be
harder to prove why s/he left.113
The breach of contract need not be the only reason for the
employee resigning, but it must be one of the reasons.114 For
example, if the employee resigns partly because s/he believes s/he
has been bullied and partly because of a failure to pay her sick pay,
s/he can still prove constructive dismissal if a tribunal decides there
was no bullying but that the failure to pay sick pay was a fundamental
breach of contract.115 An employee is often reluctant to resign before
s/he has found another job and this can cause problems, both because
during the delay s/he might affirm the contract, and because it might
suggest s/he eventually resigned for a completely different reason. If
an employee resigns as a consequence of securing another job, but
the seeking of alternative employment was driven by the fundamental
breach, s/he probably can still claim constructive dismissal.116
Nevertheless it is safest for the employee not to wait too long, as it

6.48

6.49

can then appear that s/he wanted to leave for reasons which are
nothing to do with the employer’s breach.
It is up to the employee whether to give notice or not, but it is
risky to give longer notice than the statutory minimum or that
required under his/her contract, even for financial reasons, since that
might be taken as evidence of affirmation.117
Once the employer has committed a fundamental breach of
contract, it remains a fundamental breach even if the employer later
tries to put it right.118 The employee can still resign at a later stage as
long as s/he has not affirmed by staying in the job after the original
breach.

Situations where there is no dismissal
6.50

6.51

Where an unforeseen event occurs which makes future performance
of the employment contract impossible or radically different, eg
terminal sickness or imprisonment, the contract is frustrated and the
employee cannot claim s/he has been unfairly dismissed. This is,
however, very rare. Employers sometimes try to claim frustration
inappropriately, eg in cases of ordinary long-term sickness. Given
the change in emphasis towards the treatment of lengthy sickness
arising from law prohibiting disability discrimination, frustration in
these circumstances should apply less readily. Further, where the
employee is disabled, the contract cannot be frustrated if the
employer is in breach of a duty to make reasonable adjustments.119
Termination by mutual agreement means the employee cannot
claim unfair dismissal or other rights dependent on a dismissal
having taken place. It is not always obvious whether a mutual
termination has taken place. Voluntary redundancy depends on the
facts; it may be a dismissal, although it is likely to be fair.120
Similarly, early retirement, unless involuntary, is usually a mutually
agreed termination. Employees need to be careful. A dismissal
accompanied by a settlement package, however small, may appear
later to an ET to indicate a mutually agreed termination. Another
situation where there may be no dismissal is where the employer

offers reinstatement after an internal appeal. For more detail on this,
see para 22.24.
An employer cannot deprive an employee of the right to claim
unfair dismissal by informing him/her in advance that the contract
will automatically terminate on the happening of a certain event, eg
the worker’s late return from holiday. This would effectively
circumvent the ET’s jurisdiction and is invalid.121

6.52

What makes a dismissal unfair?
The two stages
ERA 1996 s98 sets out how an ET should decide whether a
dismissal is unfair. There are two basic stages:

6.53

1) The employer must show what was the reason, or if more than one, the principal reason,
for the dismissal.122 The reason must be one of the four potentially fair reasons set out in
ERA 1996 s98(2) or some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify dismissal.
2) The ET must then decide in accordance with ERA 1996 s98(4) whether it was fair to
dismiss the employee for that reason.

The reason for the dismissal
The potentially fair reasons are the following:

6.54
•

a reason relating to the employee’s capability or qualification for performing work of the
kind s/he was employed to do;123

•

a reason relating to the conduct of the employee;124

•

the employee is redundant;125

•

the employee could not continue to work in the position s/he held without contravention of a
duty or restriction imposed by or under an enactment;126

•

for some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee
holding the position which the employee held.127

If the employer cannot show the reason for dismissal, the dismissal
will be unfair. If there are several reasons, the employer must
establish the principal reason. The dismissal will be unfair if the
reason shown is insignificant, trivial or unworthy.128

6.55

The reason for dismissal will be the set of facts known to the
employer at the time of dismissal or a genuine belief held on
reasonable grounds by the employer which led to the dismissal.129
This usually means that the reason is what is in the mind of the
dismissing manager or panel. However, in some circumstances it
may include a reason or fact in the mind of an investigating officer or
person in the hierarchy of responsibility above the worker, but
unknown to the dismissing officer.130 An employer is not prohibited
from giving one reason for dismissal at the time or immediately
afterwards and another once ET proceedings have started, although
the change may affect the employer’s credibility. It is the true reason
for the dismissal at the time of the dismissal which is relevant. The
ET will be reluctant to accept a change of reason if raised at the
hearing for the first time, particularly if it will cause prejudice to the
employee and the employee will not have had the fullest opportunity
to answer the allegations made.131

Was it fair to dismiss for that reason?
ERA 1996 s98(4)
6.56

ERA 1996 s98(4) sets out the statutory test of fairness:
… the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to
the reason shown by the employer)–
(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative
resources of the employer’s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or
unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and
(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.

The ET must take into account a number of considerations in
deciding the fairness of a dismissal under ERA 1996 s98(4). The
relevant factors vary according to the reason for the dismissal.132
There are also broad considerations which apply to all section 98(4)
dismissals. See also chapter 22 regarding fair disciplinary
procedures.

Employer’s size and administrative resources
6.57

In deciding whether a dismissal is fair, an ET must have in mind the
size and administrative resources of the employer. The larger the
employer, the greater the obligation to operate proper disciplinary,
grievance and consultative procedures. This does not mean small
employers can get away with poor employment practices, but they
may be able to take a more informal approach.
Equity and the substantial merits of the case

6.58

Equity requires that an employer treats employees consistently; an
arbitrary or capricious dismissal will be inequitable. If, on a
different occasion, the employer failed to dismiss another employee
for a similar offence, the dismissal may well be inequitable and
therefore unfair.133
Human rights

6.59

If the Human Rights Act 1998 applies because a right under the
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is involved in the
facts surrounding the dismissal, the ET must consider whether the
dismissal was fair having regard to that Convention right.134 This
applies whether the employee was employed in the private or public
sector.
The band of reasonable responses

6.60

The real question is not whether the ET would itself have chosen to
dismiss the employee in the circumstances, but whether the decision
to dismiss fell within ‘the band of reasonable responses’ open to a
reasonable employer. The ET must not substitute its own opinion for
that of the employer. The ET may think that the dismissal was harsh,
but nevertheless within the band of reasonable responses. Within
such a band, one employer might reasonably retain the employee
whereas another employer might reasonably dismiss him/her. If so,
then it is not unfair dismissal, even if the ET would not itself have
chosen to dismiss.135

6.61

6.62

6.63

This is a very important concept which results in many claims of
unfair dismissal being rejected. It is to be noted that ERA 1996
s98(4) gives no scope or support for this approach. It is a judicial
creation, but the case-law is very firmly established on the point and
legal challenges have failed.136 Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal
has repeatedly told the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) it must
not too readily interfere with ETs’ decisions as to whether a
dismissal falls inside or outside of the band of reasonable
responses.137 Employers have to be held accountable to some
standard and there is a band within which the employer must fall –
‘an employer cannot be the final arbiter of its own conduct in
dismissing an employee’.138
When deciding whether a dismissal was unfair, it is not for the
tribunal to find out the truth about the employee’s conduct or
capability. Instead, the tribunal has to ascertain what the employer
believed, and to decide whether the employer carried out a fair
investigation and had reasonable grounds for that belief. This
approach was established in a case concerning dishonesty,139 but it
tends to apply to many types of unfair dismissal case. The final
question is then whether the sanction was fair. The band of
reasonable responses test applies both to the way the investigation
was carried out and to the employer’s decision regarding the
sanction.
Confusingly, a tribunal may have to make a separate decision in
the same case as to the employee’s actual conduct for other purposes,
eg where a conduct dismissal is unfair, to decide whether the
employee in fact contributed to his/her dismissal by his/her
conduct,140 or if there is a notice claim and the employer asserts
dismissal was for gross misconduct.141
The ACAS Code

6.64

Although it is not against the law in itself to fail to follow any
relevant part of the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and
Grievance Procedures, the Code sets standards of sound industrial
practice and a tribunal must take it into account.142 The latest edition

of the Code (March 2015) is disappointingly short and basic, setting
out minimal standards of good practice. This may be because a
tribunal is now able to increase or reduce compensation by up to 25
per cent for any unreasonable failure by the employer or employee
respectively to follow the Code’s guidance.143 ACAS has also
produced a guidance booklet, Discipline and grievances at work:
the ACAS guide (July 2020), but this has no formal legal status, and
it is hard to know whether a tribunal will find it persuasive.144 For
more detail of the Code and guidance booklet, see chapter 22.
Procedural unfairness
6.65

6.66

The key case of Polkey v AE Dayton Services145 established that a
dismissal may be unfair purely because the employer failed to follow
fair procedures in carrying out the dismissal. This case overturned
the previous ‘no difference’ rule, so that it is now unfair to omit fair
procedures even if following them is unlikely to have altered the
decision to dismiss. However, compensation will often be reduced if
the dismissal was substantively fair, ie for a fair reason.146 The only
exception to Polkey is if the employer was reasonable to consider at
the time that carrying out such procedures would have been utterly
futile. It is very rare that consultation, for example, would be utterly
futile. The exception probably envisages circumstances such as
making unexpected redundancies following a sudden and unforeseen
financial crisis.147 However, even the appointment of a receiver is
something which has usually been foreseen and may not involve
closure, so would not usually excuse consultation.
The House of Lords in Polkey gave some guidance on what it
considered to be fair procedures. It would not normally be fair to
dismiss an employee for incapacity without giving him/her fair
warning and an opportunity to improve; in a conduct case, a
dismissal would not normally be fair unless the employer fully
investigated and listened to what the employee had to say; in a
redundancy case, it would not normally be fair unless the employer
warned and consulted any affected employees or their
representatives, adopted a fair basis for redundancy selection and

6.67

took reasonable steps to find redeployment.148 Not all procedural
failings will make a dismissal unfair – it is important to consider the
fairness of the whole process as a whole.
Failure to hear an appeal would almost always make a dismissal
unfair, as would procedural defects in the appeal, unless these were
very minor.149 On the other hand, a comprehensive appeal process
can cure procedural defects in the original dismissal. It is not
relevant whether the appeal is by way of rehearing or review, but
what is important is whether the disciplinary process as a whole is
fair.150

Automatically unfair dismissals and detriments
short of dismissal
Introduction
6.68

6.69

Certain dismissals are not subject to the reasonableness test and are
treated as automatically unfair. In most of these cases, there is no
minimum service requirement. It is also unlawful to subject an
employee to a detriment other than dismissal for most of the
automatically unfair reasons. The most common reasons are set out
below.
The list is constantly added to as employees or workers are given
new rights which they must be allowed to assert without fear of
dismissal or detriment. Several of the listed reasons apply to
workers generally as well as to employees. This is where the
substantive right is given to workers. In such cases, the worker can
claim for dismissal as well as action other than dismissal under the
general heading of ‘detriment’. The law of unfair dismissal does not
apply to non-employees, and this is why dismissal of a worker is
treated within the word ‘detriment’. Detrimental action after the
worker has left, eg by providing a poor reference, is probably also
unlawful.151

Pregnancy and maternity

It is automatically unfair to dismiss a female employee or select her
for redundancy for a reason connected with her pregnancy or
maternity.152 There is no minimum qualifying service.153 A woman
who is dismissed while pregnant but for non-related reasons can
claim ordinary unfair dismissal, but only if she has the usual
qualifying service. It is also unlawful to subject a female employee
to a detriment other than dismissal.154 The prohibited reasons are
those connected with any of the following:155

6.70

•

the employee’s pregnancy; or the fact that she has given birth, where the detrimental act
takes place during the ordinary or additional maternity leave period, or in the case of
dismissal, where it ends the ordinary or additional maternity leave period.156 Presumably
taking time off for antenatal care would be included within this category;

•

the fact that she took or sought to take the benefits (eg preserved terms and conditions) of
ordinary or additional maternity leave or shared parental leave (SPL), or the employer
thought she was going to take SPL.157 The protection in respect of SPL also applies to ‘P’
(the person sharing SPL with the mother);158

•

the fact that she failed to return after maternity leave when the employer had not notified
her of her return date (see para 11.25) or because she considered, undertook or refused to
work on the keeping-in-touch (KIT) or shared parental leave in touch (SPLIT) days (see
paras 11.66–11.67);159

•

a requirement or recommendation for a health and safety suspension (see para 11.83);160

•

if she is made redundant during the ordinary or additional maternity leave period or while
taking SPL or adoption leave and not offered any existing suitable alternative vacancy.161

6.71

6.72

It is not automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss for the above reasons
(except those related to SPL)162 where the employer proves it is not
reasonably practicable, for reasons other than redundancy, to allow
the woman to return to a suitable and appropriate alternative job, and
an associated employer offers such a job, which the woman accepts
or unreasonably refuses.163 The woman may be able to claim unfair
dismissal on ordinary principles, but she will need two years’
minimum service.
If a woman is dismissed while pregnant or at the end of her
maternity leave, she is entitled to written reasons for her dismissal,
whether or not she asks for them, and regardless of her length of

service.164 For more details of pregnancy and maternity rights, see
chapter 11.

Other family and domestic entitlements
It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee or subject him/her
to a detriment other than dismissal for any of the following reasons:

6.73

•

because s/he took, sought to take or made use of the benefits of adoption leave or paternity
leave, or because the employer believed s/he was likely to take adoption leave or paternity
leave or because s/he reasonably failed to return on time because the employer did not give
the proper notification of the return date or because s/he worked or refused to work on
KIT days;165 similar exceptions apply as for maternity leave;166

•

for reasons related to taking time off to accompany his/her partner to antenatal
appointments or for pre-adoption appointments;167

•

because s/he took or sought to take parental leave or time off for care of dependants under
ERA 1996 s57A;168

•

because s/he refused to sign a workforce agreement related to parental leave or because
s/he is a workforce representative or candidate;169

•

for a reason connected to the employee taking parental bereavement leave or its benefits
or because the employee was likely to take parental bereavement leave.170

There is no minimum service requirement to make these claims.171 It
is not automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss for the above reasons
(except in relation to parental bereavement leave)172 where the
employer proves it is not reasonably practicable, for reasons other
than redundancy, to allow the employee to return to a suitable and
appropriate alternative job, and an associated employer offers such a
job, which the employee accepts or unreasonably refuses.173

Flexible working
6.74

The right to request flexible working is set out at para 11.121
onwards. It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee
because s/he has applied for flexible working under the statutory
scheme, or brought an ET claim, or alleged the existence of any
circumstances which would constitute a ground for bringing such

proceedings.174 There is no minimum service requirement.175 It is
unlawful to subject an employee to a detriment other than dismissal
for the same reasons.176

Part-time working
6.75

Paragraph 11.113 onwards sets out workers’ rights under the Parttime Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment)
Regulations (PTW Regs) 2000.177 It is automatic unfair dismissal to
dismiss an employee because s/he has done anything in relation to
the PTW Regs 2000, including alleging that the employer has broken
the PTW Regs 2000 (unless a false allegation in bad faith), refusing
to forgo a right under the PTW Regs 2000, bringing a case or giving
evidence for a colleague, or requesting a written statement of reasons
why the employer has broken the PTW Regs 2000.178 It is also
automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee because the
employer believes or suspects s/he has done or intends to do any of
those things. There is no minimum service requirement.179 A worker
who is not an employee also must not be dismissed for those reasons.
It is unlawful to subject both employees and workers generally to a
detriment other than dismissal for those reasons.180

Fixed-term employees
6.76

The rights of fixed-term employees are set out at para 1.41 onwards.
It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee because s/he
has done anything in relation to the Fixed-term Employees
(Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations (FTE Regs)
2002181 including alleging that the employer has broken the FTE
Regs 2002 (unless a false allegation in bad faith), refusing to forgo a
right under the FTE Regs 2002, bringing a case or giving evidence
for a colleague, or requesting a written statement of reasons why s/he
has been treated contrary to the FTE Regs 2002.182 It is also
automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee because the
employer believes or suspects s/he has done or intends to do any of
those things. There is no minimum service requirement.183 It is also

unlawful to subject an employee to a detriment other than dismissal
for those reasons.184

Agency workers
6.77

It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an agency worker who is
an employee because s/he has brought proceedings under the Agency
Workers Regulations (AW Regs) 2010,185 given evidence or
information in connection with such proceedings, made a request for
a written statement under the AW Regs 2010, alleged that an agency
or a hirer has breached the AW Regs 2010, refused or proposed to
refuse to forgo a right conferred by the AW Regs 2010 or otherwise
done anything under the AW Regs 2010.186 This does not apply if the
allegation made by the agency worker was false and not made in
good faith. It is also unlawful to subject an agency worker (whether
or not an employee) to a detriment for these reasons. Employees
qualify for this protection regardless of their length of service.187

Dismissal for asserting a statutory right
6.78

6.79

6.80

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee or select him/her
for redundancy for alleging that the employer has infringed a
statutory right or for bringing proceedings to enforce such a right.188
Employees qualify for this protection regardless of their length of
service.189
The statutory rights covered include: minimum notice; any right
conferred by the ERA 1996 and various rights under the TULR(C)A
1992 which can be enforced in an ET, eg rights to antenatal care,
itemised payslips, statements of terms and conditions; the right not to
have unauthorised deductions from wages (which can include delays
in payment);190 the right to time off for trade union activities and the
right not to suffer action short of dismissal which prevents, deters,
penalises or compels union membership; rights conferred by the
Working Time Regulations (WTR) 1998191 and by TUPE Regs 2006.
As long as the employee’s allegation is made in good faith, it does
not matter whether s/he is correct in thinking s/he has the right or that

it has been infringed. It is also unnecessary for the employee to name
the right, as long as s/he has made it reasonably clear to the employer
what the right was.192 However, this protection only applies to
allegations that the employer has already infringed the statutory right
– not to allegations that the employer is likely in the future to infringe
such a right.193
This concept has some similarities to the law prohibiting
victimisation for taking up issues under the EqA 2010 and there are
likely to be similar difficulties of proving the link between a
dismissal and the assertion of a statutory right. It is therefore wise to
make any request, eg for payslips or clarification of terms and
conditions, in a reasonable manner and in writing.

6.81

Health and safety
Overview
It is unlawful to dismiss employees or subject them to detriments for
various kinds of health and safety reasons in ERA 1996, s100. There
is no minimum service requirement.194 There is also enhanced
compensation for successful cases.
Note that whistleblowing protection can also be invoked in some
circumstances where a worker is victimised for taking up health and
safety issues. Whistleblowing law protects workers (not just
employees) who raise concerns about health and safety through the
proper channels.195

6.82

6.83

Serious and imminent danger
It is automatically unfair to dismiss or select for redundancy an
employee because, in circumstances of danger which s/he reasonably
believes to be serious and imminent:

6.84

•

s/he refuses to work in the place of work, when s/he cannot reasonably be expected to
avert the danger;196 or

•

s/he takes appropriate steps for self-protection or to protect others and does not act
negligently in doing so.197 The reasonableness of the employee’s actions will be judged by

reference to all the circumstances, including the employee’s knowledge and the facilities
and advice available to him/her at the time;198
•

It is also unlawful to subject employees to a detriment for these reasons, eg by refusing to
pay them. Workers have had the same protection since 31 May 2021.199

6.85

6.86

6.87

6.88

There are two initial stages: 1) there must be ‘circumstances of
danger’, and 2) the worker must reasonably believe those
circumstances of danger are ‘serious and imminent’.200 It is
irrelevant whether the danger was in fact serious and imminent, or
whether the employer at the time believed that it was.201 All that
matters is that the worker reasonably believed this.
‘Danger’ has a wide meaning, and can include danger of violence
from a co-worker, or being put at risk by careless actions of a
colleague.202 The worker can take appropriate steps to ‘protect
others’ as well as him/herself from the danger. This includes
members of the public, eg in one case, a chef who was dismissed for
refusing to cook food which he considered unfit for human
consumption, could bring a claim.203
Historically, there have been few cases on the meaning and scope
of the protection. However, successful ET cases have included
dismissals for refusal to drive defective vehicles and a dismissal of
a young female employee who refused to take rubbish alone at night
to a deserted dump.
Recently, there has been far greater interest in this legal protection
because of issues arising in respect of the Covid-19 pandemic. In
theory, workers must not be penalised or dismissed if they refuse to
work or take other protective measures because they reasonably
believe there are serious and imminent danger of catching Covid-19
or passing it on to others. Whether their belief is reasonable may
depend on factors such as the level of the virus in the community at
the relevant time, whether they and others have been vaccinated,
whether they or others are particularly vulnerable, government
guidance at the relevant time, whether there has been a risk
assessment, what protective measures the employer has put in place,
and whether these are effectively enforced. Scientific and medical
evidence may be relevant. It is conceivable that a worker may hold

6.89

the necessary reasonable belief even if an employer has put all
recommended government measures in place.
It is untested whether the legislation covers danger in travelling
into work on public transport. In Edwards & others v The Secretary
of State for Justice, the EAT accepted it covered a situation where
employees were asked to travel on a road which the police or
highway authority had closed in snowy conditions.204 However, this
was a slightly different situation in that the refusal was to get on
board transport provided by the employer.
Health and safety representatives, and others raising harmful
working conditions

6.90

6.91

Employees designated with a specific health and safety duty under
statute or by agreement with the employer have the right not to be
dismissed or subjected to detrimental treatment because they carry
out or propose to carry out their health and safety duties.205 The way
in which the designated employee carries out his/her health and
safety activities is also protected, unless, possibly, if the
representative is acting completely unreasonably, maliciously or
irrelevantly to the task in hand.206 As with trade union dismissals, a
health and safety representative who has been dismissed may be
entitled to interim relief and enhanced compensation.
Where there is no health and safety representative at the
workplace or it is impracticable for the employee to raise the
particular issue through the representative, it is also automatically
unfair to dismiss an employee because s/he brings to the employer’s
attention by reasonable means conditions of work which s/he
reasonably believes are harmful or potentially harmful to health and
safety.207 It is also unlawful to subject the employee to any detriment
other than dismissal on any of these grounds.208

Trade unions and employee representatives
6.92

It is unlawful for an employer to subject a worker to a detriment
including dismissal in order to prevent, deter or penalise him/her for

joining or not joining a trade union, taking part in its activities, using
its services, or refusing to accept an inducement.209 Where the
worker is an employee, it is automatically unfair to dismiss him/her
or select him/her for redundancy for any of those reasons.210 An
employee can claim unfair dismissal for these reasons regardless of
his/her length of service.211 Employee representatives are also
protected.212

The right to be accompanied in disciplinaries and
grievances
6.93

The statutory right to be accompanied to disciplinaries and
grievances is set out at para 22.39 onwards. It is unlawful to subject
a worker to a detriment either because s/he has exercised the right to
be accompanied or because s/he has accompanied or sought to
accompany another worker.213 It is also automatic unfair dismissal to
dismiss an employee for those reasons. No minimum service
requirement applies.214

Not declaring spent convictions
6.94

The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974 gives certain
workers the right not to disclose previous convictions which are
‘spent’ as a result of the passage of a specified length of time. The
length of time depends on the nature of the conviction, and the
rehabilitation period ranges from six months to ten years. It is thought
to be automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for failing to
disclose a ‘spent’ conviction.215 There is still the need to satisfy the
qualifying requirements as with ordinary unfair dismissal claims. It
is to be noted that exception orders can be made to exclude the
protection of the ROA 1974.216

Jury service
6.95

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee or select him/her
for redundancy because of jury service unless the employer told

him/her that his/her absence was likely to cause substantial injury to
the employer’s undertaking and the employee unreasonably refused
to apply to be excused from the service.217 There is no minimum
service requirement.218 It is also unlawful to subject an employee to
a detriment other than dismissal for this reason.219

Minimum wage, working time and tax credits
Paragraph 4.71 onwards deals with the WTR 1998220 and para 4.33
onwards sets out the law on the minimum wage. It is automatic unfair
dismissal to dismiss an employee or select him/her for redundancy
for any of the following reasons, regardless of length of service.221 It
is also unlawful to dismiss a worker or subject a worker (including
an employee) to a detriment other than dismissal:

6.96

•

because s/he refused or proposed to refuse to comply with a requirement imposed by the
employer in contravention of the WTR 1998 or because s/he refused to forgo a right
conferred on him/her by the WTR 1998.222 There must be an explicit refusal. A refusal
cannot be implied from the worker’s conduct. For example, it is not enough in itself for a
worker who is dismissed for falling asleep while on duty to say s/he was dismissed for
taking a rest break under the WTR 1998;223

•

because s/he brought proceedings against the employer to enforce a right conferred by the
WTR 1998 or even just alleged that the employer had infringed such a right.224 The worker
does not need to prove s/he actually has the legal right or that the employer has in fact
infringed it, as long as s/he makes the allegation in good faith. The allegation need not
specifically mention the WTR 1998 but the worker must be clear what type of right s/he is
talking about, eg ‘You make me work all day without any breaks’ is probably sufficient;225

•

because s/he failed to sign a workforce agreement or vary any other agreement provided
for in the WTR 1998 or for being a workforce representative or candidate for the purposes
of the WTR 1998 Sch 1;226

•

because of qualifying for a minimum wage rate or seeking to enforce the minimum wage,
etc;227

•

because the worker took action to secure the benefit of a tax credit and certain related
reasons.228

Sunday trading

6.97

Shop workers229 and betting workers need not work Sundays if they
give their employer an opting-out notice. ‘Protected’ shop and
betting workers, ie those employed from the time the Sunday Trading
Act 1994 was passed, need not work Sundays unless they provide an
opting-in notice.230 An employee who is an opted-out or protected
shop worker or betting worker will be treated as automatically
unfairly dismissed if the reason, or where there is more than one
reason the principal reason, for dismissal is the refusal to do shop
work or betting work on a Sunday.231 No minimum service is
required.232 S/he also has the right not to be subjected to a
detriment.233 Apart from these rights, workers unable to work
sabbaths for religious reasons may bring a claim for indirect
religious discrimination under the EqA 2010.

Trustees of occupational pension schemes
6.98

The dismissal of an employee is treated as automatically unfair if the
reason relates to any function discharged as a trustee of an
occupational pension scheme.234 No minimum service qualification
is required.235 The employee also has the right not to be subjected to
a detriment other than dismissal.236

Dismissal because of the transfer of an undertaking
6.99

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee due to the transfer
of an undertaking unless the dismissal is for an economic, technical
or organisational (ETO) reason entailing changes in the workforce. It
is necessary to have at least two years’ qualifying service as for
ordinary unfair dismissal claims. As mentioned in para 6.79 above,
it is also automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for asserting
statutory rights conferred by the TUPE Regs 2006. No minimum
service is required for such a claim. For more details, see chapter 10
on the TUPE Regs 2006.

Zero hours contracts

6.100

It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee on a zero
hours contract if the reason or principal reason is that s/he has
breached an exclusivity clause or purported exclusivity clause.237
There is no minimum qualifying service.238 It is also unlawful to
subject an employee to a detriment for that reason or to subject a
worker to a detriment including dismissal. A zero hours contract is
one where there is no certainty that work will be made available. An
exclusivity clause is any provision in the contract which prevents the
worker from working for anyone else or under another arrangement,
or which requires the employer’s consent to do so.239 See para 1.40
for more detail on zero hours contracts.

Protection for whistleblowers
Overview
6.101

Public inquiries found that in many of the major disasters of the
1990s, workers were aware of the danger but were afraid to speak
out. Partially as a response to this, the Public Interest Disclosure Act
(PIDA) 1998 introduced a new Part IVA into the ERA 1996 to
provide public interest whistleblowers with protection against
victimisation. The provisions are complex and should be read
closely before taking any action. There is a short checklist in
appendix A at A26 which must be read together with this text if a
worker is considering blowing the whistle. In recent years, the
legislation has rather lost its way, becoming increasingly – and often
unsuccessfully – used by individuals seeking to complain about their
own work problems, rather than providing solid backing to workers
who want to speak out about serious public dangers. In 2013, the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government legislated
to try to get things back on track. On the one hand, disclosures would
in the future only be protected if they were in the public interest. On
the other hand, workers would get protected for making real public
interest disclosures even if they were motivated by personal
animosity to their employer. There is also a longer standing power
for tribunals to pass on information about whistleblowing claims to

6.102

6.103

6.104

the relevant regulators where claimants agree.240 The approved ET1
form asks the claimant at section 10 whether s/he would like this to
happen. The charity Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work)
provides expert advice and has a very practical website.241 There is
a Whistleblowing: guidance for employers and code of practice
(March 2015), which contains ideas on designing and, more
importantly, promoting a whistleblowing policy, and sets out good
practice on dealing with disclosures.242
The law covers workers (not just employees), contractors, agency
workers, home workers, NHS professionals (even if self-employed)
and trainees.243 There is an extended definition of a ‘worker’ for
individuals supplied by a third party who would not otherwise be
employed as a worker. For example, an agency worker who is
victimised for whistleblowing by the organisation where s/he is
placed could potentially be protected.244 It is automatic unfair
dismissal to dismiss an employee because s/he has made a
‘protected disclosure’ of information.245 No minimum service is
required.246 It is also unlawful to dismiss a worker for making a
protected disclosure. In addition, a worker (including an employee)
has a right not to be subjected to a detriment other than dismissal,247
eg disciplinary action, lack of promotion or a poor reference after
s/he has left.248 A threat could also amount to a detriment. Workers
are also protected against dismissal or detriments because of
disclosures made after their employment ended249 or in their
previous employment to their previous employer.250 In general,
whistleblowing law does not protect job applicants. However, an
exception is made where NHS employers discriminate against job
applicants because they have made protected disclosures in the
past.251
The disclosure need not necessarily concern wrongdoing by the
worker’s employer; it can include wrongdoing by a third party, eg
fraud or breach of health and safety obligations by a client of the
employer.252
Work colleagues can sometimes become upset about the
whistleblowing and turn on the whistleblower. It is possible to make

a claim in respect of any detrimental actions (including dismissal253)
carried out by work colleagues in the course of their employment or
by authorised agents of the employer. Further, employers will be
vicariously liable for such actions, even if they were done without
their knowledge or approval, unless they can show they took
reasonable steps to prevent such actions happening.254 This is
similar to the vicarious liability rules for discrimination by coworkers under the EqA 2010 although there are some differences.
Content of the disclosure
The worker must have disclosed information and not simply made an
allegation.255 This distinction can become a problem in a tribunal
case, but actually the two categories are closely intertwined and the
fact that the worker has made an allegation, does not necessarily
mean that s/he has not also disclosed information.256 The relevant
‘information’ can be about something that has not been done, eg ‘The
wards have not been cleaned for two weeks’.257 But a pure
allegation such as ‘You are not complying with health and safety
requirements’ would be too lacking in factual content to amount to
information.258 In some cases, although the disclosure on its own is
too vague, sufficient information is provided by its context, eg a
chain of correspondence or where the individual is when s/he makes
the disclosure.259 If the worker wants to rely on the context when
bringing a tribunal case, it is important to spell this out in the tribunal
claim form.
The information disclosed must fall within certain categories and
it must be disclosed to the correct person in the correct way.260 A
‘qualifying disclosure’ means any disclosure of information which,
in the reasonable belief of the worker, is made in the public interest
and which tends to show one or more of the following:261

6.105

6.106

•

that a criminal offence has been, is being or is likely to be committed, eg fraud or assault;

•

that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation. This
includes a legal obligation contained in the worker’s contract of employment and could also
include any statutory requirement or common law obligation, eg negligence, nuisance or

defamation.262 In theory, a complaint about an employer’s breach of contractual obligations
could cover many things, although – as already stated – it must disclose information and not
simply amount to an allegation. An even greater difficulty with this category of disclosure
might be the requirement that the worker reasonably believe disclosure is made ‘in the
public interest’ (see below). This requirement was introduced in June 2013 as an attempt to
stop the proliferation of tribunal claims brought by workers complaining that they had been
dismissed or subjected to a detriment because they had complained about the way their
employer was mistreating them personally;
•

that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur;

•

that the health and safety of any individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered,
eg risks to hospital patients, train passengers or consumers as well as to work colleagues
and the worker him/herself, although in the latter case, bear in mind the ‘public interest’
requirement;263

•

that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged;

•

that information tending to show any of the above has been, is being or is likely to be
concealed.

6.107

6.108

6.109

6.110

There does need to be sufficiently detailed and specific information
to be capable of tending to show any of the above matters.264 Simply
saying that behaviour is ‘inappropriate’ or ‘manipulative’ without
more facts is unlikely to be enough.
The worker only needs to believe that the information ‘tends’ to
show the relevant matter – s/he does not have to go as far as
believing that the information does actually show such a matter.265
Moreover, the worker’s allegations need not be factually correct, but
it must be reasonable for the worker to believe that the factual basis
of what is disclosed is true and that it tends to show one of the
above-listed matters.266
When making the disclosure, it is not necessary for the worker
explicitly to say that s/he believes the information tends to show a
particular matter, or even for it to be obvious. However, if the
worker does say so, it is easier to prove that is what s/he thought at
the time.267
It does not matter that the information is confidential, but the
worker must not commit an offence by making the disclosure, eg by
breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989.

The public interest
In Chestertons v Nurmohamed, the Court of Appeal gave no precise
definition of the meaning of ‘public interest’, but laid down these
guidelines:268

6.111

•

At the time s/he made the disclosure, the worker must have reasonably believed the
disclosure was in the public interest. The tribunal should consider separately (i) did the
worker believe this, and (ii) if so, was that belief reasonable?

•

The reason why the worker held that belief is not critical. Indeed, the tribunal might later
find the worker’s belief was reasonable but for different reasons.

•

The worker’s belief that disclosure was in the public interest need not be his/her
predominant motive for making the disclosure. Arguably, it need not form any part of the
worker’s motivation.

•

The relevant question is not whether disclosure actually was in the public interest but
whether the worker reasonably believed that it was. There might be more than one
reasonable view as to whether the disclosure was in the public interest, and the tribunal
must not substitute its own opinion.

•

Whether it was reasonable to believe disclosure was in the public interest is something for
tribunals to decide on the facts. It is possible for a disclosure to be made in the public
interest even if the worker also has his/her own interests in mind. The main idea is to debar
disclosures made exclusively in the worker’s personal interests. It is not essential for
outside interests to be involved – the ‘public’ can comprise other employees within the
organisation employing the worker. Relevant considerations could be, for example, the
nature of the interests affected and to what extent; whether the alleged wrongdoing was
deliberate or inadvertent; the profile and identity of the person or organisation alleged to
have done wrong; and the number of people affected. In the latter case, if those affected
were simply other employees with the same personal interests as the worker, it is just about
possible that large numbers could convert a private interest into a public one. Although
tribunals should be cautious if this last consideration is the only factor, it is likely that where
large numbers share similar private interests, other features of the situation will also engage
the public interest.

To whom the disclosure is made
6.112

ERA 1996 ss43C–43H set out to whom qualifying disclosures may
be made and in what circumstances. It is important to read these

6.113

carefully, but in general, internal disclosures269 are more readily
protected. For example, a worker who makes disclosure to someone
with managerial responsibility only needs a reasonable belief about
the malpractice. The same applies to disclosure made to someone
authorised by an employer under a procedure,270 eg an internal
whistleblowing procedure, which allows the matter to be raised with
a trade union or health and safety representative, an external auditor,
a retired director or the employer’s lawyers. There is no requirement
to have such an internal procedure, but employers may find that it
encourages internal disclosure first. During parliamentary debate, the
government and the sponsors of the bill consistently expressed the
view that trade unions would have a valuable role both in framing
such procedures and in being authorised to receive disclosures.
Disclosures can also be made in certain circumstances to the
worker’s MP or to a person prescribed by the secretary of state,271
eg as set out in the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons)
Order 2014 as periodically amended.272 It is useful to look at the
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) list on
the GOV.UK website for its clear layout and description of the type
of matter covered by each prescribed body. The bodies include (as
appropriate): the Charity Commissioners; the Care Quality
Commission; the NHS Trust Development Authority; the Health and
Care Professions Council; Healthcare Improvement Scotland; the
Nursing and Midwifery Council; HM Chief Inspector of Education,
Children’s Services and Skills; Commissioners for HMRC, Revenue
Scotland, the Information Commissioner and Scottish Information
Commissioner; the General Medical Council; the Food Standards
Agency, Food Standards Scotland, the Health and Safety Executive,
the Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection
Agency; the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (OFGEM); the
Water Services Regulation Authority; Audit Scotland; the National
Crime Agency; the Independent Office for Police Conduct; the Office
of Rail and Road; the Office for Nuclear Regulation; and Welsh
Ministers in relation to children’s social care.273

Disclosure can be made to these bodies even if the matter has not
been raised internally first, provided that the worker reasonably
believes that the relevant failure falls within a matter for which that
body is prescribed and that the information disclosed and any
allegation made is substantially true.
Good faith
6.114

6.115

In the past, there was a requirement that the disclosure was made ‘in
good faith’. Under whistleblowing law, a disclosure was not made in
good faith if the worker had an ulterior motive for whistleblowing,
eg personal antagonism towards his/her manager. The good faith
requirement greatly undermined whistleblowing protection because a
worker with ulterior motives would not be protected from
repercussions, even if s/he reasonably believed the disclosed
information was true.274 The position now is that a worker no longer
loses his/her case if the disclosure was not in good faith, but a
tribunal may reduce his/her compensation by up to 25 per cent if it
thinks it just and equitable to do so. It is for the employer to prove
that a disclosure is not in good faith, and this will require strong
evidence.275 It is common for workers to be fiercely cross-examined
on this aspect and, as people tend to have mixed motives, it is often
problematic.
Disclosures can be made in the course of obtaining legal advice276
and the previous position was that good faith was not required for
this anyway. However, if the lawyer is authorised to pass on the
disclosure, eg by communicating with the employer, then the good
faith rules apply in the usual way. Disclosures to trade union lawyers
would also be covered, but it is less certain whether disclosure to a
lay trade union official for the purpose of getting legal advice is
covered. Trade unions may be best advised to set up specific advice
lines to cover this situation. Disclosure to a trade union official for
other purposes must otherwise fit one of the other categories of
protected disclosure, eg as part of an authorised internal procedure
(see above).

Wider disclosures
6.116

6.117

6.118

Wider disclosures, eg to the media, MPs or police, are protected
only in more limited circumstances, including that they are not made
for personal gain.277 It must be reasonable in all the circumstances to
make the disclosure, taking account in particular of the identity of the
person to whom disclosure is made, and also the seriousness of the
matter, the likelihood of recurrence and the employer’s reaction if the
matter was previously raised internally.278 Except where the
disclosure relates to a failure of an exceptionally serious nature,279
the worker must already have made disclosure to his/her employer or
reasonably fear a detriment if s/he raises it with his/her employer or
a prescribed body, or if there is no prescribed body, s/he must
reasonably fear that the evidence will be concealed or destroyed by
the employer.280
Any term in an agreement or contract of employment which tries to
gag a worker by imposing confidentiality will be void, provided the
disclosure is otherwise within the ERA 1996.281
It is for the tribunal to judge whether the worker had made a
protected disclosure; it is not a defence for an employer to say s/he
felt s/he could safely dismiss the worker because s/he genuinely
believed the disclosure was not protected, eg because s/he thought
the disclosure was not made in the public interest.282
Bringing a case

6.119

When bringing a case, workers should be careful to address each
stage of the legal requirements in the tribunal claim and in the
evidence.283 Where the claim is for automatic unfair dismissal due to
whistleblowing, there are no complex rules about who has the
burden of proof. As with all unfair dismissal claims, the employer
must prove the reason for dismissal. If the employee is suggesting
that the employer dismissed him/her for whistleblowing, s/he has to
produce some positive evidence of that, but s/he does not have to
discharge any burden of proof. Having heard the evidence of both
sides and making inferences from the primary facts, the tribunal will

6.120

6.121

6.122

decide what the reason for dismissal was. If the employer is unable
to prove an alternative reason, this may indicate that whistleblowing
is the true reason, but not necessarily.284 However, if the employee
does not have sufficient length of service to claim ordinary unfair
dismissal, the burden of proof lies on the employee to prove s/he
was dismissed for whistleblowing reasons.285
Where the claim is for detriment, the burden of proof is closer to
that in discrimination claims, ie once less favourable treatment
amounting to a detriment following a protected disclosure has been
shown, the employer must prove under ERA 1996 s48(2) on what
ground s/he acted and that the protected disclosure was no more than
a trivial influence, if any, on the employer’s treatment of the
whistleblower.286 This is different from the position on an automatic
unfair dismissal claim, where because of different wording in the
legislation, it is unlawful only if the protected disclosure was a
larger factor, ie it must have been the reason or principal reason for
dismissal.
Remember that the worker needs to show that the employer has
subjected him/her to a detriment on the ground that s/he made the
initial disclosure. It is not enough to show that if the worker had not
made the disclosure, a train of events would not have followed.287
An employer has not subjected a worker to a detriment simply
because the worker becomes distressed when the employer fails to
do anything about the allegations, eg out of laziness or inefficiency,
as opposed to a deliberate decision to ignore or persecute the
worker precisely because s/he made the disclosure.
What happens if the person who makes the decision to dismiss
does not know about the protected disclosure or is not influenced by
it, but is influenced by someone else who does know about the
disclosure and is hostile towards the worker as a result? An
employee can still hold the employer responsible for automatic
unfair dismissal in these circumstances if the person manipulating the
evidence was the employee’s line manager or someone else in the
hierarchy of responsibility above the employee.288 A similar
problem arises in discrimination cases.289 Where this is a possible

6.123

6.124

scenario, it is a good idea also to claim that the input of the
manipulative manager is itself a whistleblowing detriment.
A worker may also be unprotected if the true reason s/he is
disciplined is not for making a disclosure, but for taking unauthorised
actions to prove the risk s/he is complaining about, eg hacking into a
computer to prove data protection may be inadequate.290
Remedies are similar to those for ordinary unfair dismissal except
that there is no ceiling on the compensatory award.291 In detriment
cases (though not those involving dismissal of a worker), awards can
be made for injury to feelings along the lines of discrimination
cases.292 Interim relief may also be claimed if the ET application is
lodged within seven days from the effective date of termination.293

Retirement
6.125

It used to be possible to force an employee to retire at the age of 65
or lower objectively justifiable normal retirement age if the
employer went through the correct procedures. If the procedures
were properly followed, a dismissal could not be challenged as
unfair. On the other hand, if an employee was forced to retire but the
employer got the procedure wrong, the dismissal would be
automatically unfair. These rules no longer apply and are not set out
in this edition of the book. See para 14.27 onwards for age
discrimination and retirement.

Dismissal during industrial action
6.126

6.127

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee within the protected
period – generally the first 12 weeks of industrial action (with some
extensions) because s/he took protected industrial action.294 This
includes later dismissals, where the employee had stopped taking
industrial action within the 12 weeks.295 No minimum service is
required.
After the first 12 weeks, the position is less straightforward. An
ET will have no jurisdiction to hear the employee’s unfair dismissal
claim if all those taking part in the action or affected by the lock-out

6.128

6.129

were also dismissed and none were re-engaged within three
months.296 This is designed to protect employees against selective or
targeted dismissals. The only exception is if the employee is
dismissed for specific reasons related to family, dependant leave,
health and safety, working time, employee representatives,
whistleblowing or other automatically unfair reasons.297
An employee dismissed while taking part in unofficial industrial
action cannot claim unfair dismissal.298 Broadly speaking, industrial
action is unofficial unless some or all of its participants are members
of a trade union which has authorised or endorsed the action.299
There are complicated rules on this. There are the same exceptions
as for dismissals on official action.300
The EAT has stated recently that under TULR(C)A 1998 s146,
workers must not be subjected to a detriment in order to prevent or
deter them from taking part in industrial action or to penalise them
for having done so (see para 2.8). It is not entirely clear how this fits
with the separate rules set out in the preceding two paragraphs.

Employee shareholders
6.130

6.131

Despite massive opposition from the House of Lords, the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government eventually
passed legislation creating the status of ‘employee shareholders’.
The law is contained in ERA 1996 s205A, with effect from 1
September 2013. There is little evidence that it has been taken up.
In summary, a worker who agrees to become an ‘employee
shareholder’ gives up certain employment rights in return for fully
paid-up shares in the employing company which must be worth at
least £2,000. The rights which an employee shareholder gives up
are: the right to claim unfair dismissal (except for automatic unfair
dismissal or a dismissal which would be discriminatory under the
EqA 2010); the right to statutory redundancy pay; the right to request
time for study or training; and the right to request flexible working
(except within 14 days of return from parental leave). It is not
possible to give up rights to claim discrimination under the EqA
2010.

Chapter 7: Key points
Capability or qualification dismissals
•
•

•

•

•

•

Capability dismissals cover sickness, injury and qualification
dismissals, as well as dismissals relating to ability to do a job.
Sickness and injury dismissals fall into two categories: longterm sickness/injury; and intermittent absence from work. The
employer has to satisfy different requirements depending on
the category.
With long-term sickness/injury dismissals, the employer should
obtain a medical report (to find out the nature and likely
duration of the illness/injury) and discuss this report with the
employee before dismissing. See also the adjustments
suggested under disability discrimination law.
How long the employer should wait depends on the difficulty of
covering the employee’s absence, and the prognosis. There
should be no rigid rule.
With a competence dismissal, the test is not whether the
employee was actually incompetent, but whether the employer
genuinely believed s/he was incompetent, on reasonable
grounds, having carried out a proper investigation.
Only in exceptional cases will a dismissal for a first act of
incompetence be fair. The exceptions concern employees who
are responsible for the safety of the public, eg as airline pilots
or bus drivers. Otherwise, employers should give an
opportunity to improve, and offer guidance and support if
appropriate.

General guide to useful evidence
•

With sickness dismissals, get a copy of all the medical reports.
If the employer did not rely on a medical report, get a report

•

•

•

from the employee’s GP for use at the employment tribunal
(ET) hearing.
If other employees have had more time off and there is any
suggestion of inequitable treatment or discrimination, get
details of their sickness records. This might be evidenced by
the statutory sick pay (SSP) records.
If the dismissal is due to incompetence, get information on the
nature and consequences of the incompetence; check past
appraisals.
Obtain any written sickness and capability procedures.

Conduct dismissals
•

•

•

•

It is usually only with acts of gross misconduct that an
employer can fairly dismiss for a first offence. Acts of gross
misconduct are normally set out in the disciplinary procedure.
The ET’s function is not to determine whether the employee
was guilty of the offence. The ET has to determine whether
the employer acted reasonably in dismissing the employee. If
the employee was not guilty, then it may well be an unfair
dismissal, but this is not always the case.
The test is whether the employer genuinely believed the
employee was guilty, on reasonable grounds, having carried
out a proper investigation. If so, was dismissal a fair sanction?
The ET cannot decide what investigation and decision it would
have conducted and reached itself. It can only measure what
the employer did by the objective standard of any reasonable
employer.

General guide to useful evidence
•
•

It is important to get a copy of the disciplinary procedure and
check whether the employer followed it.
Obtain notes of the disciplinary hearing and ask the worker for
his/her version. Decide whether it was fairly and properly
conducted. Had the decision already been made to dismiss?

•
•

Ascertain the evidence relied on by the employer in deciding to
dismiss. Obtain copies of earlier warnings.
Find out whether any other employees have committed similar
acts of misconduct and not been dismissed.

‘Some other substantial reason’ dismissals
•

•

•

The most common types of ‘some other substantial reason’
(SOSR) dismissal are where the dismissal arises out of a
reorganisation at the workplace or refusal to agree a variation
of contract terms.
It is necessary for the dismissal to be for a substantial reason.
Where the interests of the employer and the employee cannot
be reconciled, the tribunal will consider whether a reasonable
employer could have dismissed in the circumstances.
Dismissals due to incompatibility with other employees will be
for SOSR.

General guide to useful evidence
•
•

Any evidence to show that it was not prejudicial to the
employer to continue to employ the employee will be valuable.
Find out if any other employees in a similar situation were
dismissed.

Capability or qualification dismissals
Introduction
7.1

An employer may claim that a dismissal relates to the capability or
qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind s/he
was employed to do.1 The statutory definition of ‘capability’ is
‘capability assessed by reference to skill, aptitude, health or any
other physical or mental quality’.2 ‘Qualification’ means ‘any
degree, diploma or other academic, technical or professional
qualification relevant to the position which s/he held’.3

Incompetence dismissals
Overview
An incompetence dismissal is one that is due to the employee’s
inability to perform the job to the standard expected by the employer.
It includes situations where that standard is higher than the norm in
the industry.4

7.2

The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)
It is important to note that the employer need not prove in the
employment tribunal (ET) that the employee actually was
incompetent. The employer need show only that s/he genuinely and
reasonably believed that the employee was incompetent. The test is
as follows:

7.3

•

Did the employer honestly believe that the employee was incompetent or unsuitable for the
job?

•

If so, was such belief held on reasonable grounds?

•

In forming such a belief, did the employer carry out a proper and adequate investigation? In
most cases, this would include giving the employee an opportunity to answer the
criticisms.5

7.4

To show that the employer’s belief was reasonable, the ET may
accept evidence of the honest views of the employee’s managers.
Other evidence against the employee may include complaints by
customers or other staff, or a drop in sales figures. On the other hand,
the employee may be able to prove the employer’s belief was
unreasonable, eg by showing s/he had above-average sales figures or
s/he was understaffed or overworked, or that s/he recently had a
good appraisal or a merit pay rise. Remember that since the ET
cannot make its own judgment on the level of the employee’s
competence, the employer only needs enough evidence to show
his/her belief was reasonable.
Other factors are relevant to the fairness of the dismissal. The
employer should previously have made the employee aware of
his/her dissatisfaction, given reasonable time to improve and warned

7.5

7.6

of the consequences if s/he did not. The amount of time which should
be allowed for improvement depends on the facts including the type
of job, the level of incompetence, length of service and seniority. An
ET usually expects the employer to have taken steps to try to improve
the situation, eg by offering support and/or supervision, or retraining, setting targets and monitoring progress. The extent of
assistance that should have been offered depends on the employer’s
size and administrative resources.
It is rarely fair to dismiss an employee on the basis of one act of
incompetence. The exception is where the consequences are so
serious that to continue to employ the employee would be too risky
and dangerous, eg when a mistake is made by an airline pilot or a
coach driver.6 In this type of situation, dismissal without retraining
or being given the chance to improve would usually be fair.
The ET may also take into account whether the employer had any
alternative vacancy which could have been offered to the employee
prior to dismissal. An employer will not be expected to create a
vacancy or new job for the employee. The failure to offer alternative
employment is not an overriding factor in capability dismissals but it
is a relevant consideration, particularly where a large employer had
appropriate vacancies which were not offered to the employee.

Aptitude and mental quality dismissals
Overview
7.7

An ‘aptitude’ dismissal may be because an employee is inflexible at
work or is difficult or disruptive or not prepared to adapt.7 ‘Mental
quality’ would include an employee’s lack of drive or having a
personality which has a detrimental effect on colleagues’ work or on
customers.8 If an employee has not satisfied the necessary standards
required by the employer due to carelessness, negligence or idleness,
this is more appropriately dealt with as misconduct rather than
incapability.9
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.8

The employer must show that the employee’s inflexibility or other
mental quality was detrimental to the business. Prior to dismissal, the
employer should have given sufficient and adequate warnings
detailing the alleged shortcomings and the employee ought to have
been provided with a reasonable opportunity to improve. As usual,
the employer’s size and administrative resources will be relevant in
judging the adequacy of the procedures followed.

Sickness, injury and other health dismissals
Overview
7.9

An employer who dismisses an employee for ill-health or sickness
absences may be dismissing on grounds of capability or conduct.10 It
will be a dismissal for conduct if the employer believes that the
employee is not ill but is using sickness as an excuse not to work.
Since different considerations will be relevant to the fairness of
dismissing for conduct, it needs to be established what was the
principal reason for dismissal. This section deals with capability
dismissals. Note that in some circumstances, an employee may gain
protection from the Equality Act (EqA) 2010 in respect of disability
discrimination (see chapter 15).
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.10

There are two distinct forms of absence from work as a result of illhealth:
1) several intermittent absences, not necessarily for the same reason; and
2) a prolonged continuous absence due to a single medical condition.

The proper steps for an employer to take, prior to dismissing an
employee, depend on whether the ill-health was intermittent or
continuous. In respect of both situations, it is necessary for the
employer to have regard to the whole history of employment and take
into account a range of factors such as the nature of the illness, the
length of absences, the likelihood of the illness recurring, the need of

the employer to have the employee’s work done, and the impact on
others of the employee’s absence.
1)

Before dismissing, the employer must have made it clear to the
employee what level of attendance was expected. If the employer is
dissatisfied with the employee’s attendance record, s/he should
conduct a fair review of the record and give the employee an
opportunity to explain the reason for the various absences.11 Any
warning after the review should make it clear that the employee may
be dismissed if there is no improvement. If there is no satisfactory
improvement following a warning, dismissal will usually be fair.12
An employer also ought to take into account the following factors:

7.11

7.12

7.13

•

the length of absences and periods of good health;

•

the likelihood of future absences;

•

the nature of the employee’s job and the effect of absences;

•

the consistent application of the employer’s absenteeism policy.13

Employees should be gently warned that their absence may lead to
dismissal, but genuine illness should not be treated as a disciplinary
matter. The employer should handle each case individually in a
sympathetic, understanding and compassionate manner.14
If there is an underlying medical condition, the employer should
usually take medical advice and follow the steps appropriate in
cases of long-term sickness (see below).
2)

7.14

7.15

Intermittent absences

A single period of prolonged absence

The basic question is whether in all the circumstances the employer
could be expected to wait any longer and, if so, how much longer.15
Each case must be considered on its own facts and an employer
cannot hold rigidly to a predetermined period of sickness after which
any employee may be dismissed.
An ET would expect the employer to have found out the true
medical position and to have consulted with the employee before
making a decision. A medical report on the implications and likely

7.16

7.17
7.18

length of illness should generally be obtained from the employee’s
GP or a company doctor or independent consultant. Where the
employer gets a report from a company doctor, the employer should
also be willing to consider a report from the employee’s own GP or
specialist. Whereas the former may be more familiar with working
conditions, the latter may be better placed to judge the employee’s
health.
The Access to Medical Reports Act (AMRA) 1988 covers
workers’ access to reports prepared by a medical practitioner who
has responsibility for their clinical care.16 An employer must not
apply to a worker’s doctor for a report without first getting the
worker’s written consent, having notified the worker in writing of
his/her rights under the Act.17 Most employers have a standard
notification and consent form for this. The worker is entitled to see
the report before it is sent to the employer if s/he so requests and to
make amendments with the doctor’s agreement.18 The worker must
be told of these rights at the time s/he is asked for his/her consent to
the obtaining of the report. The employer is supposed to tell the
medical practitioner that the worker wants access to the report
before it is supplied, but it is advisable for the worker also to remind
the doctor of this. If the doctor does not consent to any requested
amendments, the worker has the right to attach a personal statement
to the report.19 The doctor must give the worker a copy of the report
if requested, except in certain excepted circumstances.20 A worker
may also have rights under the Data Protection Act 2018 or the
Access to Health Records Act 1990 to health records held on
him/her by the employer or any external doctor working for the
employer.
If an employee refuses to see a company doctor or allow any
medical report, s/he increases the risk of being fairly dismissed.
Once the employer has the report, a meeting should be arranged to
discuss its contents with the employee. In general, the employer must
take such steps as are sensible in the circumstances to discuss the
matter and become informed of the true medical position.21

Consultation will often throw new light on the problem, bringing up
facts and circumstances of which the employer was unaware.22
Unless the medical advice is obviously inaccurate, based on
inadequate information or lack of proper examination, the employer
is allowed to rely on what the doctor says, as long as the employee
gets a chance to comment. If the employee’s GP report is more
favourable than the employer’s own medical report (often from
occupational health practitioners), the employer can choose which
report to follow if s/he has a good reason for the choice. Obviously,
the GP knows the employee better, whereas an occupational health
doctor will be more familiar with the work environment. In some
cases, the difference could only reasonably be resolved by getting a
third opinion from a specialist.
The employer’s decision ought to be based on the following
factors:

7.19

7.20

•

the nature and likely duration of the illness;

•

the need for the employee to do the job for which s/he was employed and the difficulty of
covering his/her absence. The more skilful and specialist the employee, the more vulnerable
s/he is to being fairly dismissed after a relatively short absence;

•

the possibility of varying the employee’s contractual duties. An employer will not be
expected to create an alternative position that does not already exist nor to go to great
lengths to accommodate the employee.23 However, a large employer may be expected to
offer any available vacancy which would suit the employee. What is reasonable very much
depends on the facts;

•

whether or not contractual sick pay has run out is just one factor either way;24

•

the nature and length of the employee’s service may suggest the employee is the type of
person who is likely to return to work as soon as s/he can, but length of service would not
necessarily be relevant in any other way.

7.21

It is important for the employer to have discussions with the
employee and for the employee to know when his/her job might be at
risk. However, the word ‘warning’ should be avoided because it is
associated with misconduct. The issue relates to the employee’s
capability, not conduct, and the consequence of a warning may be
counterproductive.25 These days, this can be seen with the common

7.22

7.23

7.24

use of staged sickness absence procedures which almost inevitably
increase the employee’s stress and can set back recovery, especially
where the employee has mental ill-health. On the other hand,
employers are entitled to be kept informed of the situation and indeed
can be criticised if they do not keep in touch. They also need to
forewarn an employee if there is a risk of dismissal.
Sometimes the nature of the illness or injury is such that an
employee may never be able to perform his/her contractual duties
again or any performance would be radically different from what
s/he and the employer envisaged at the outset. If this happens, the
contract of employment may be ‘frustrated’ and just come to an end
(see para 6.50). Since the employer will not have actually dismissed
the employee, the employee will be unable to claim unfair dismissal
or notice.26 The courts and tribunals are extremely reluctant to say
that an employment contract has ended in this way because of the
dire consequences for the employee. Further, where the employee is
disabled, the contract cannot be frustrated if the employer is in
breach of a duty to make reasonable adjustments.27
An employee suffering from long-term ill-health may succeed in a
claim for disability discrimination under the EqA 2010, where s/he
would have failed in an unfair dismissal claim. The EqA 2010
places greater obligations on the employer, eg to modify the
employee’s duties or actively find alternative employment.
It is not necessarily unfair to dismiss an employee at a time when
s/he is still entitled to contractual sick pay. It is just one factor to be
taken into consideration. It is unlikely to be fair to dismiss an
employee purely because his/her sick pay has run out. Where the
employee is still receiving a benefit under a health insurance scheme,
the position is unusual. It is likely to be a breach of contract to
dismiss him/her while s/he is still receiving that benefit, unless the
dismissal is for gross misconduct or for proper and reasonable cause
(which cannot be the ill-health itself).28 It does not automatically
mean the employee will win an unfair dismissal claim or a claim for
discrimination arising from disability, but it will be a very relevant
factor.29 Some employees have a potential entitlement to an enhanced

pension for ill-health retirement. If the employer knows that an
employee has incapacity and is likely to be entitled to this, it may
well be an unfair dismissal not to take reasonable steps to explore
it.30 On the other hand, it may not be unfair dismissal if it was
reasonable for the employer to believe ill-health retirement was not
relevant, eg because the employee kept insisting s/he would
eventually be fit to return to work.
Ill-health or stress caused by the employer
7.25

7.26

If the employee is unable to do the job because of injury or ill-health
originally caused by the employer, this does not necessarily mean the
dismissal is unfair. The ET can take it into account when considering
whether it is reasonable to dismiss in the circumstances, but it is
unlikely to be a big factor.31
The employee may have claims against the employer in legal areas
outside the employment law field, eg for personal or industrial
injuries. For an introduction to employers’ duties to do risk
assessments and personal injuries claims for stress, see chapter 17.
See also para 17.5 regarding the NHS Injury Allowance.
Going on holiday while on sick leave

7.27

Employees may legitimately not be at home during sickness leave.
They may be out visiting the doctor or staying with relatives. As long
as they keep in touch in the way required by their contract or
sickness procedure, they need not be available to answer every
telephone call. Occasionally employees are dismissed for going on
holiday or attending college while off sick. This is not necessarily
contradictory, as the employee may be absent due to work-related
stress, and a holiday may in fact help.32 Nevertheless, it is advisable
for an employee ask his/her GP whether it is a good idea to go, and
then to check with the employer.

Dismissals due to other physical quality
Overview

7.28

An ‘other physical quality’ would include an injury or loss of faculty
which affected the employee’s ability to perform the job. Employees
may also gain protection from the disability discrimination law under
the EqA 2010.33 Although outside the scope of this book, note that an
injury sustained at work may give rise to a personal injury claim
against the employer, including compensation for loss of earnings.
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.29

The employer will usually be able to justify dismissal if the injury is
such that it is impossible or dangerous for the employee to perform
his/her job. Before dismissal, the employer should consult the
employee concerning the injury and its consequences for future
employment. It may be possible for the employee to retrain or use
aids to overcome the loss of faculty. An employer should offer any
suitable alternative vacancy.

Qualification dismissals
Overview
7.30

A qualification dismissal is one where an employee loses a
qualification or fails to obtain a qualification which was a condition
of his/her employment. A common example is disqualification from
driving when having a licence is a necessary requirement of the job.
This requirement need not be expressly stated in the contract where
the job clearly entails driving duties.34 An employer may also
require a qualification during the employee’s employment which the
employee does not possess and is unable or unlikely to acquire.
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.31

Where an employee loses a qualification which s/he is required to
have under his/her contract or which is necessary for the job, it may
be fair to dismiss. The employer would not usually be expected to
create an alternative job, but s/he should make an effort appropriate
to the size and administrative resources of the enterprise and the
availability of vacancies.

An employer may require new qualifications because of the
introduction of new technology or a different mode of operation. It
may be fair to dismiss an employee who fails to acquire the new
qualification if the employer can justify the need for it. The employer
must also act reasonably in the introduction of the requirement, eg by
offering retraining. Failure to give an employee a fair and proper
opportunity to satisfy the new requirement will make the dismissal
unfair.35 An employer’s insistence on certain qualifications may be
indirect race, sex or age discrimination contrary to the EqA 2010.36

7.32

Conduct dismissals
Introduction
Unlike with capability and qualification dismissals, there is no
statutory definition of conduct dismissals. Nevertheless, there are a
number of activities which are recognised as potential misconduct
and are usually listed in the disciplinary procedure if there is a
written contract of employment – for example:

7.33

•

theft or other dishonesty;

•

violence and fighting;

•

unauthorised absenteeism37 or lateness;

•

disobedience;

•

being under the influence of alcohol or drugs;38

•

threatening or abusive language;

•

misuse of telephone, email or internet;

•

behaviour undermining the implied term of fidelity and good faith.

Some acts of misconduct amount to ‘gross misconduct’. The main
relevance of this concept is that an employer dismissing for gross
misconduct need not give notice under the contract.39 Unfair
dismissal is a separate issue. It may be fair or unfair to dismiss an
employee for gross misconduct. However, as gross misconduct
involves more serious forms of misconduct, it is more likely to be
fair to dismiss for a single act, with no previous warnings.

7.34

Conduct outside working hours might lead to a fair dismissal in
some circumstances, where it has relevance for the work situation.
Whether a dismissal is fair will depend on a number of factors, such
as adverse publicity, implications for the workplace, relevance to the
job and whether the conduct outside work could be said to breach the
implied term of trust and confidence. A risk of reputational damage
from criminal charges, even if not yet proved in court, can be
sufficient justification for dismissal, though this should not be
assumed, and the type of charge will be relevant.40 Where relevant,
an ET should bear in mind the employee’s right to respect for his/her
private life under the European Convention on Human Rights
(ECHR), but this can be outweighed by the impact on the employer.41

Issues of fairness common to many conduct
dismissals
7.35

For general principles of fairness in any unfair dismissal case, see
paras 6.53–6.68 and chapter 22 regarding disciplinary procedures.
An employer should take account of the explanation given by the
employee; actions taken in previous similar cases; the employee’s
disciplinary and general record; and whether the intended
disciplinary action is reasonable under the circumstances. The
employee’s length and nature of service is relevant if it suggests the
misconduct was out of character and unlikely to recur. There has
been an increasing tendency in recent years for employers to say they
are dismissing an employee for ‘breach of trust and confidence’,
when the real reason amounts to misconduct or maybe capability.
Employers should not be allowed to avoid the usual stages
associated with a conduct dismissal, simply by giving it a vague
generic label of this kind.42 In misconduct cases, the tribunal should
first consider the three stages in the famous British Home Stores v
Burchell case,43 and then consider whether it was fair to dismiss for
that misconduct. The stages are:
1) whether the employer genuinely believed the employee committed the misconduct in
question;

2) whether the employer held that belief on reasonable grounds; and
3) whether the employer carried out a proper and reasonable investigation.

The band of reasonable responses test described at para 6.60 above
applies to the evidence relied on and the investigation carried out as
well as the decision to dismiss.44 In other words, it is not for the
tribunal to decide how it would itself have carried out the
investigation or what evidence it would have found satisfactory. The
tribunal must simply decide whether a reasonable employer could
have investigated that way and found that evidence sufficient. The
following issues frequently arise in conduct dismissals, although
some of the principles may be transferable to other types of
dismissal:
•

fair investigation;

•

inconsistency in the treatment of different employees;

•

taking account of previous warnings;

•

the importance of the disciplinary rules;

•

cross-examination of witnesses at the disciplinary hearing.

Fair investigation
7.36

It is very important that the employer follows a fair procedure and
investigates properly. The degree of appropriate investigation
depends on a number of factors including the complexity of the
case,45 the nature of the offence, the size and administrative
resources of the employer46 and whether the employee confessed to
the misconduct or was caught red-handed. Employers are not
expected to carry out investigations to the standard required in
criminal cases. However, where the consequences for an employee
are particularly serious, eg where the employee’s reputation or
ability to work in his/her chosen field is at risk, employers should be
particularly careful that they carry out a conscientious
investigation.47 Having said that, ECHR Article 8 (right to respect
for one’s private and family life) does not add any higher standard of
procedural fairness than the usual unfair dismissal test in such
cases.48

7.37

7.38

The employer’s disciplinary procedure should be followed in
conducting the investigation, or in the absence of a procedure,
whatever steps the ET deems fair in order to ensure justice.49 A
failure to follow a contractual disciplinary procedure will often, but
not necessarily, result in a finding of unfair dismissal.50 It’s the
overall fairness of the procedure followed which counts. Regard
will be had to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service
(ACAS) Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedure,
especially if there is no contractual procedure.51 Any contractual
procedure should state what acts of misconduct are considered by the
employer to be gross misconduct, the various stages of the procedure
itself, the right to be represented and the right of appeal against any
decision reached.
An investigatory officer may go on to hold the disciplinary hearing
as long as s/he has not become so involved that s/he cannot be
impartial.52 A person who has been a witness, should not normally
hold the disciplinary inquiry, but there are certain exceptions.53
Furthermore, it is a requirement of the rules of natural justice that an
employee knows the allegations made against him/her, that s/he has
an opportunity to answer those allegations fully and that the conduct
of the investigation and internal hearings is in good faith.54 The
allegations must be clearly put to the employee. It would be unfair,
for example, to tell the employee that s/he is facing an allegation of
breach of procedures, but to dismiss him/her for dishonesty. An
employee should only be found guilty of an offence of which s/he is
charged.55 If an investigating officer finds evidence or takes a
statement which is helpful for the employee, that evidence should be
shown to the employee even if the investigator does not want to rely
on it and does not intend to show it to the disciplinary panel.56 It is
also likely to be unfair if the investigating officer withholds relevant
facts from the dismissing officer/panel.57 Delay in the investigation
can in itself make a dismissal unfair if it is substantial and there is no
good reason for it. It is not essential for the employee to show that
s/he has been prejudiced by the delay, though it will be an extra

ground of unfairness if s/he has, eg if the result is inability to speak
to certain witnesses or faded memories.58
Inconsistency
7.39

The ACAS Code says employers should act consistently. This can
come up in two ways – either because two employees commit the
same offence at the same time, but only one is dismissed; or because
other employees have been treated more leniently for the same
offence in the past.59 Both situations are potentially unfair, but in
practice, inconsistency rarely makes a dismissal unfair in a
particular case. This is partly because any argument about
inconsistency only works if the comparable situations really are
similar. In reality, few cases are identical.60 Also, where an
employer consciously thinks about the two cases and makes a
distinction between them, the dismissal will only be unfair if there
was no rational (ie reasonable)61 basis for the distinction.62
Employers are allowed considerable flexibility and can choose to
become stricter than in the past, provided no one has been misled.
Inconsistency is most likely to make a dismissal unfair where
leniency in the past has led an employee to believe that a particular
offence will be overlooked, or at least that it will not lead to
dismissal.63 If an employer wants to clamp down on certain offences,
this should be made clear in advance to employees. In some
circumstances, inconsistency may also be an indication that there is
some other reason for the dismissal entirely.64 It could even be an
indication of discrimination because of a protected characteristic
under the EqA 2010. From an unfair dismissal viewpoint, it is not a
good reason for treating similar cases differently that different
managers dealt with the two incidents.65 An employee cannot
complain of inconsistency in failing to discipline a colleague, if the
employer was unaware of the other person’s misconduct. Lack of
consistency is often argued in front of tribunals, but rarely succeeds.
It is more important for the tribunal to consider the individual facts
of the particular case and to decide on the usual ERA 1996 s98(4)

test whether the dismissal fell within the band of reasonable
responses.66
Disciplinary rules
Many written disciplinary procedures contain a set of rules
specifying disciplinary offences as well as those which are regarded
as gross misconduct. The ACAS Code67 says that:

7.40

•

rules and procedures should be clear, specific and in writing;

•

employees and where appropriate, their representatives, should be involved in the
development of rules and procedures; and

•

it is important to help employees and managers understand what the rules and procedures
are, where they can be found and how they are to be used.

Unless an offence is very obviously gross misconduct, it will be
relevant (though not conclusive) to consider whether it is mentioned
in the rules. A written rule effectively operates as a warning. On the
other hand, it will be unfair for an employer automatically to dismiss
for any offence listed as dismissable within the rules, without
considering the circumstances of the individual case.
Taking account of previous warnings
7.41

The ACAS Code recommends that an employee is told how long a
warning will remain current. Previous live warnings can be taken
into account in a decision to dismiss, even if they concern different
offences, although this may affect how much significance should be
attributed to them.68 It is a question of overall fairness, taking
account of the number of previous warnings, the time periods
between them, and the nature of the offence each time.69 When an
employer relies on an existing final written warning in deciding that
further misconduct warrants dismissal, s/he does not need to
reinvestigate whether that warning was fairly given, provided it was
given in good faith and there were prima facie grounds for it – that
is, it was not issued for an oblique motive and was not manifestly
inappropriately issued.70 Nor should an ET reopen the matter except
in the same circumstances.71 If a warning is subject to an appeal at

7.42

the time of the later offence, an employer can rely on its existence
provided it is also taken into account that an appeal is pending.72 If
the appeal on the previous warning is due to be heard very soon,
arguably the employer should wait and deal with the appeal before
moving onto the subsequent offence. However, if the previous
warning was obviously inappropriate, then it cannot be relied on by
the employer even if the employee chose not to appeal against it.73
It is recognised good practice that warnings are disregarded for
disciplinary purposes after a specified period, eg six months for a
first written warning and 12 months for a final written warning.
Many disciplinary procedures also recommend that warnings are
disregarded or removed from the file after a period. If the employer
has chosen to state that the warning will lapse after a specified
period, it is usually unfair subsequently to rely overtly on the lapsed
warning in deciding to dismiss, especially where the final offence
would not otherwise justify dismissal on its own.74 However, there
are circumstances where the existence of previous warnings can help
to make the employer’s decision to dismiss reasonable, eg if an
employee has a history of re-offending shortly after many previous
expired warnings.75 Another example is where the final offence is in
itself worthy of dismissal, but the employer would be more lenient to
an employee who had never previously been disciplined. Airbus UK
Ltd v Webb76 provides a good example. In that case, the company
decided it would be reasonable to dismiss five employees for
watching TV while on night duty, but if there was a good reason not
to dismiss anyone, s/he would be given a lesser penalty. Four
employees with good disciplinary records were therefore given
warnings, but Mr Webb was dismissed because he had previously
been disciplined for doing other things when he should have been
working. In fact, he had a final written warning which had expired
only three weeks before this further offence. The Court of Appeal
said the fact that the employer took account of an expired warning in
this way did not mean the dismissal had to be unfair. It depends on
what is fair overall. Obviously the fact that a warning has expired is
a relevant factor.

Cross-examination at the disciplinary hearing
Some disciplinary procedures give employees the right to crossexamine witnesses against them at disciplinary hearings. Otherwise,
it all depends on the facts whether an employer can act reasonably
without allowing the employee to cross-examine witnesses against
him/her.77 It is always important that employees should know the
evidence against them but it may be enough if they have been shown
witness statements. If the employer is relying on information from an
informant who wishes to remain anonymous, it is important that:

7.43

•

a full statement is taken and shown to the employee;

•

the hearing officer interviews the informant and takes careful notes;

•

the employer considers whether the informant has any reason to fabricate information
against the employee.78

Theft and other dishonesty
Overview
7.44

An employee may be dismissed for an act of dishonesty, whether at
work or outside work,79 and whether against the employer, a fellow
employee or the public. Dishonesty dismissals often relate to
offences peculiar to the working environment such as borrowing
money without authorisation, fraudulent expense claims,80
unauthorised use of the employer’s property and clocking offences.81
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.45

It is imperative to understand the difference between the criminal
law and unfair dismissal law. Many employees feel that the ET is the
arena for them to clear their name. Unfortunately the real issue is not
whether the employee actually committed the offence but whether, in
the circumstances, it was reasonable for the employer to dismiss. An
ET may well find that an employee was fairly dismissed for
suspected theft, even though by the time of the ET hearing s/he has
been acquitted by a criminal court. The employer need not await the
outcome of any criminal trial. What counts is whether the employer,

at the time of dismissal and having carried out reasonable
investigations, genuinely and reasonably believed that the employee
committed the theft.82 Equally, it does not automatically justify a
dismissal that an employee has been charged with a criminal offence.
In order to dismiss fairly for dishonesty, the employer must:

7.46
•

genuinely believe that the employee was dishonest;

•

hold that belief on reasonable grounds; and

•

have carried out proper and adequate investigations.83

The final question is whether dismissal is a fair sanction and in
proportion to the offence. The ET cannot substitute itself for the
employer and decide whether it would itself have dismissed or
carried out a fuller investigation.84 It is irrelevant whether the
evidence against the employee is insufficient to satisfy an ET of
his/her guilt, if by the objective standards of a reasonable employer,
the investigation and conclusion was reasonable.85 What counts is
the evidence in front of the investigating and dismissing officers. It
does not help to put evidence of the employee’s innocence to the ET
if the employee chose not to produce that evidence to his/her
employer at the time (unless that was due to the employer’s failure
properly to investigate). For the same reason, it is irrelevant that
untruthful evidence from the employee’s manager influenced the
dismissing officer, if it was reasonable for the dismissing officer to
have believed the manager rather than the employee.86
If the employer is unable to ascertain which of a group of
employees was guilty of the dishonesty, the employer may fairly
dismiss all of them solely on reasonable suspicion, provided that:

7.47

•

after proper investigation, the employer tries and is unable to identify which employee is
guilty;

•

the employer genuinely believes, on reasonable grounds, that one or more of the group is
guilty; and

•

any member of the group was capable of having carried out the dishonest act.87

It will be inequitable and unfair to dismiss only some members of the
group to which the employer has narrowed things down. However,

7.48

7.49

the more ‘suspects’ the employer dismisses, the stronger business
reasons s/he will need for taking such drastic action.
It is a matter of fundamental fairness that if the employer dismisses
the employee for dishonesty, the charge of dishonesty is put to the
employee as opposed to a simple charge of breach of procedures, for
example.88 As to whether dismissal for dishonesty is a fair sanction,
the ET cannot substitute its own view. As always, the test is that of a
reasonable employer. Relevant factors which an employer should
take into account are the employee’s length of service and past
conduct.89 An employer may also consider the conduct of an
employee after an offence is discovered. For example, if the
employee persistently lies, that would influence the decision to
dismiss.90
Since dishonesty is gross misconduct, dismissal for a single act is
usually justified and warnings are not normally appropriate. It is
important to emphasise long service and, if relevant, the minor extent
of the dishonesty, on the employee’s behalf.

Violence or fighting dismissals
7.50

7.51

Violence or fighting usually constitutes gross misconduct even if the
employer’s disciplinary procedure does not explicitly describe it as
such.91 Nevertheless, this does not mean that a dismissal for violence
is always fair. An employer must carry out an investigation and take
into account all relevant matters,92 eg the nature and circumstances of
the violence, whether it was in public view, the proximity to
machinery or dangerous objects,93 the status of the employees, the
length of service94 and the nature of any provocation. If the fight is
between employees with different racial backgrounds, it is also
worth checking whether there was any racial harassment provoking
the fight.95
The employer should speak to the parties involved and any
witnesses. If the employer cannot ascertain who was responsible for
the violence, the employer may dismiss all concerned if it was

serious.96 It will not usually help an employee who participated in
fighting to say that another employee initiated it.

Dismissals for unauthorised absences or lateness
Overview
Dismissals for absenteeism may relate to capability and ill-health.97
Conduct absenteeism is where an employee is absent without
authority, and it is usually a form of bad timekeeping. There may also
be issues regarding not properly notifying absence under the
employer’s sickness procedure (see also para 7.27). A common form
of unauthorised absenteeism is where an employee returns late from
a holiday.

7.52

General absenteeism or lateness
An employer is rarely entitled to dismiss for a single occasion of
lateness or absenteeism. The usual situation is when an employee is
frequently late or absent from work. Some large employers set out in
the contract of employment an ‘expected level of attendance’ below
which an employee will be dismissed. However, it is not necessarily
fair to dismiss an employee who falls below this level. The
employer should fairly review the employee’s attendance record and
the reasons for the absences. Appropriate warnings should be given
after the employee has had the opportunity to explain. If there is no
improvement, the employee’s subsequent dismissal is likely to be
fair.98
As well as fairness in procedures, the ET will take into account:

7.53

7.54
•

the employee’s age, length of service and performance;

•

the likelihood of an improvement in attendance;

•

the effect of absences on the business;

•

the known circumstances of each absence, eg a temporary domestic problem.99

If lateness or absences are caused by a health condition, eg
depression or tiredness in the morning, this may be a matter requiring
reasonable adjustments under disability discrimination law.100

Late return from holiday
7.55

7.56

Where an employer has warned the employee in advance that failure
to return from holiday on the due date will be treated as gross
misconduct, it will be easier to justify a dismissal. Unless the
employee can put forward compelling reasons why s/he should not
be dismissed, dismissal will be fair.101 It may well be discriminatory
if the employer disregards medical certificates just because they are
from abroad. Usually the employer should wait until the employee
comes back to work or invite an explanation by post.
Sometimes an employer informs the employee that if s/he returns
late from holiday, s/he will be taken to have dismissed him/herself.
Legally this is not recognised as a resignation or mutual termination.
The employee cannot be deprived of the right to claim unfair
dismissal in this way.102

Disobedience
Overview
7.57

This type of dismissal usually arises when an employee refuses to
obey an order or instruction of the employer. The instruction may or
may not be one with which the employee is required to comply under
the contract of employment.
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.58
7.59

The two key considerations are: a) the nature of the employer’s
instruction; and b) the employee’s reason for refusal to comply.
An employee is entitled to refuse any unlawful,103 unreasonable or
dangerous instruction. Although the starting point is whether the
employee is obliged to comply with the instruction under the
employment contract, this does not necessarily determine whether a
refusal is reasonable.104 It may be unfair to dismiss an employee who
refuses to obey a contractual instruction, or fair to dismiss an
employee who refuses to obey a non-contractual order. An employee
who fails to co-operate with an employer’s request to do non-

7.60

7.61

7.62

contractual overtime,105 to adapt to new technology106 or otherwise
go along with a reorganisation107 will often be found to have acted
unreasonably and to be fairly dismissed.
Where an employee is required to comply with a contractual term
which has not previously been operated and which will cause
inconvenience or hardship, the employer must give reasonable
advance notice. If no notice is given, an employee may be entitled to
refuse to comply with the instruction in the short term108 on this
ground alone.
The ET must consider also the employee’s reason for refusing to
obey the instruction, and it should weigh up the competing interests
and take into consideration the nature of the contractual relationship
between the employer and employee generally. There may be good
reason for the employee’s refusal, eg a pregnant woman refusing to
work close to a VDU screen, a risk to the employee’s safety in
handling money or a risk of civil liability.109
It can be automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee
because s/he refuses to work in a situation of serious and imminent
danger.110

Dependency on drugs or alcohol or possession of
drugs
Overview
7.63

Taking or possessing drugs at work, and sometimes out of work,
tends to be treated as gross misconduct. Drinking at work may be
treated as misconduct depending on the circumstances and what the
contract says. Dependency on drugs or alcohol is now more likely to
be treated by an enlightened employer as a medical condition111 and
will not be referred to as an act of misconduct in the disciplinary
procedure. The advantage of treating this as a health issue is that the
requirements relating to capability dismissals apply. These are more
conducive to helping the employee, as medical reports will be
obtained and appropriate treatment will be encouraged.

Dependency on alcohol or drugs
The employer must have a genuine and reasonable belief, based on
proper and adequate investigation, that the employee is dependent.
The employee should be given the chance to answer the allegations
and to obtain a medical or specialist report ifs/he wishes,
particularly if the employer treats it as a sickness issue.
In deciding whether to dismiss, the following factors will be
relevant:

7.64

7.65

•

whether the contract of employment or disciplinary procedure treats alcohol/drug
dependency as a matter of conduct or capability;

•

whether the employee is responsible for the safety of others, eg a coach driver or operator
of dangerous machinery. If so, the employee should not be permitted to continue on the job.
The employer may dismiss or transfer the employee to safer duties;

•

whether the employee works in an environment which is potentially dangerous to others or
him/herself, eg an electrician. Similar considerations apply; and

•

whether there is a risk of adverse publicity or harm to customer relations (which would be
a dismissal for ‘some other substantial reason’).

Taking or possessing drugs in or out of work
7.66

7.67

Most employers are uninformed about the different types of drugs
and their effects, so summary dismissal is common for using or
possessing drugs, particularly when at work. Many ETs take a hard
line on any drug-related dismissal.
It will usually be fair to dismiss an employee for using or
possessing drugs in or out of work, when there is a risk of adverse
publicity, harm to customer relations or other harm to the employer’s
business interests.112 However, if the possession or use of drugs is
outside the work environment, not a matter of public knowledge and
could not harm the business, the employee may be able to show that
dismissal is unfair.113
Drinking at work

7.68

This may not be a matter of alcohol dependency at all, and it will not
necessarily be misconduct to drink at work. This will depend on

whether the contract or disciplinary procedure expressly lists
drinking as misconduct or, if not, whether the employee and
employer clearly contemplated that it would be misconduct. In
certain jobs there is a zero-tolerance policy. This depends on the
nature of the job, factors such as proximity to dangerous equipment
and custom and practice.

Misuse of telephone, email, internet or social
networking sites
7.69

This is increasingly becoming a reason for dismissal. An employee
is entitled to be informed clearly in advance as to what his/her
employer’s policy is on private use of the telephone, email, internet
and social networking sites.114 There is an issue both as to use of
working time and of inappropriate content. If the policy allows
‘reasonable’ personal use, it should be clear what amounts to
‘reasonable’ and it should be applied consistently by different
managers. An employer could reasonably dismiss for gross
misconduct a lead personnel officer who downloaded pornography
from the internet on his computer.115 Downloading, and certainly
circulating, pornography may also lead to sexual harassment
claims.116 If an employee uses an unauthorised password to enter a
computer known to contain information to which s/he is not entitled,
it is gross misconduct regardless of whether s/he has some
illegitimate purpose or simply idle curiosity. Having said that, the
employer should have clearly notified employees of the rules
regarding unauthorised access.117 Employers who base disciplinary
action on material they have only discovered by unauthorised
monitoring may be in breach of the right to privacy under ECHR
Article 8, although this will not necessarily mean the dismissal is
unfair.118 With regard to social networking sites, it is important first
to identify what aspect of the employee’s social media use caused the
employer to dismiss. The reasonableness of the dismissal will be
assessed against that reason. It could, for example, be reasonable to
discipline or dismiss employees for making comments which are
defamatory, which constitute harassment of other employees who

read the tweets or messages, which breach confidentiality, or which
bring the business into disrepute. Relevant considerations are likely
to be the impact or potential impact on other employees, customers,
or the public; whether the employer can be identified; whether the
connection with the employee posting the messages is clear; and
whether the employer had any relevant policies on the matter.
Difficulties most often arise where employees imagine they are using
social media in a non-work capacity, but they do not adopt privacy
settings and/or are followed by co-workers. The right to freedom of
expression under ECHR Article 10 needs to be taken into account,
and it is strongly arguable that employees should be allowed to make
negative comments as long as they are not damaging. ACAS has
issued guidance on social media, disciplinaries and grievances,119
which acknowledges employees’ confusion over what is permissible
and recommends that employers make it clear in advance what kind
of online behaviour is not acceptable. It is worth reading the first
reported Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) case regarding unfair
dismissal because of Twitter use, even though it gives no general
guidelines: Game Retail Ltd v Laws.120 Although not an unfair
dismissal or discrimination case, Smith v Trafford Housing Trust121
is also a useful guide to how such cases may be analysed by
tribunals.

Redundancy dismissals
7.70

See chapter 8 for all aspects of redundancy including unfair
redundancy dismissals.

Statutory restriction dismissals
7.71

There are very few cases where the employer relies on a statutory
restriction as the reason for dismissal. A common example is the loss
of a necessary qualification for a job, eg a van driver losing his/her
driving licence. The employer must show that the statutory restriction
affected the work that the person was employed to perform and that
no alternative employment was available. The larger the employer,

7.72

the greater the duty to try to find an alternative to dismissal. Statutory
restriction dismissals can also occur where the worker is not
allowed to work because of his/her immigration status.122 The
employer must be right that there would be a breach of a statutory
duty or restriction if the employee was allowed to continue to work
in the job. It is not enough that the employer genuinely and
reasonably, but wrongly, believes that to be the case.123
Consultation on the consequences of the statutory restriction and
possible alternatives is very important.124 Where a restriction does
not prevent the employee from doing his/her job but makes it
difficult, eg a salesperson losing a driving licence, the employer
should consult on what assistance may be possible. Even where
continued employment of the employee would be unlawful, eg where
a GP has been struck off the medical register, the employer should
still consult on the likelihood of the decision being reversed.

Dismissals for some other substantial reason
(SOSR)
Introduction
7.73

A dismissal which is not for one of the four potentially fair reasons
may still be fair if it is for ‘some other substantial reason of a kind
such as to justify the dismissal’.125 The most common SOSR
dismissals are for reorganisation including variation of the contract
of employment, in order to protect the employer’s business interests
or as a consequence of the transfer of a business. Other situations
where a dismissal might be deemed to be for SOSR are where the
interests of the business might suffer as a result of friction at work
between two colleagues, or an employee is incompatible and does
not fit in, or due to adverse publicity on any matter, eg relating to an
employee taking drugs or having a criminal conviction. Note that a
‘substantial’ reason is one which is not trivial or unworthy but one
which would justify the dismissal.126

Dismissals due to reorganisation or variation of
contract
Overview
7.74

7.75

It is sometimes hard to differentiate between a reorganisation and a
redundancy situation. An employer may try to claim that the
dismissal is because of reorganisation, in order to avoid making a
redundancy payment.
An employee may be dismissed because s/he cannot or will not
accept a change in terms and conditions resulting from the
reorganisation. The employer first needs to prove that the
reorganisation or the employee’s refusal or inability to fit in with it
was a substantial reason such as could justify dismissal, otherwise
the dismissal will be unfair.127 In practice, it is fairly easy for the
employer to meet this initial requirement. An employer is entitled to
reorganise the workforce and terms and conditions of employment to
improve efficiency and to dismiss an employee who does not cooperate with the changes.128 It is sufficient to amount to a potentially
fair reason for dismissal for the employer to show that the
reorganisation is for sound business reasons requiring a change in the
employee’s terms and conditions.129 The reorganisation need not be
essential. It is very hard for an employee at the ET to challenge the
employer’s reasons as not being sound and good. The employer
needs only to demonstrate the benefits to the business of the
reorganisation, perceived at the time of dismissal. If the employer
cannot demonstrate these benefits existed and their importance at the
time of dismissal, the dismissal will be unfair as the employer will
not have established a ‘substantial’ reason for dismissal.130
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.76

Although the ET should consider a number of factors when deciding
whether it was fair to dismiss, it primarily looks at the situation from
the employer’s point of view, ie whether a reasonable employer
would make those changes to the employee’s terms of
employment.131 The ET considers the competing advantages and

7.77

disadvantages to the employer and the employee, but the main
emphasis in reorganisation or variation of terms dismissals is on the
employer’s interests which are paramount. Nevertheless, there have
been some ET decisions, endorsed by the EAT, indicating that an
employer does not have a completely free hand.132 It is unlikely that
an ET would think it fair to cut pay or reduce terms and conditions
merely to increase profitability of an already successful business.
However, it goes too far to say that significant changes can be made
only if the survival of the business is at stake.133 Whether or not the
majority of the workforce have agreed to changes to their terms and
conditions will be a factor.134 It will also be relevant upon whom in
the workforce the cuts fall and whether, for example, management
have exempted themselves from the cuts.135 A change in terms and
conditions may also lead to a successful discrimination claim under
the EqA 2010, eg for indirect sex discrimination on an introduction
of flexi-shifts.
Consultation plays an important part in all types of dismissal
including reorganisation. For options when an employer tries to vary
terms and conditions, see paras 1.20–1.23. The practice of
dismissing employees and offering new contracts on reduced terms
has become increasingly common in recent years and worsened due
to the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to parliamentary concerns, the
government asked ACAS to carry out a fact-finding exercise to
inform its thinking on possible action.136

Dismissals to protect employers’ business interests
Overview
7.78

7.79

There is an implied term of fidelity and good faith in every
employment contract which lasts as long as the employee is
employed. Some employees also agree to express terms which
restrict their future employment in the same industry for a given
period. These terms are known as ‘restrictive covenants’.
An employee dismissed for breaking the implied term of good
faith and fidelity will be dismissed for SOSR and perhaps also

misconduct. In addition, there may be a substantial reason potentially
justifying dismissal if:
•

an employee refuses to sign a restrictive covenant and the employer is genuinely seeking to
protect the business interests;137 or

•

there is a genuine risk arising from an employee’s relationship with a competitor.138

The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)
7.80

Where dismissal is for refusing to sign a restrictive covenant, the ET
will take into account the necessity of applying it, whether the
industry usually requires employers to take this precaution and
whether the employee’s job was of sufficient importance. The ET
will also consider the manner and method of the introduction of the
clause and whether it was consistently introduced among other
employees.

Other SOSR dismissals
7.81

Where dismissal is due to a personal relationship with a competitor,
the ET should take into account the nature of the relationship and its
bearing on the work situation. The manner of the employee’s
dismissal and the degree of notice or warning of impending
dismissal are also relevant.139 If dismissal is due to a personality
clash with colleagues, the employer should do all that is reasonable
to try to remedy the problem, which might involve transferring the
employee.140 If dismissal is at the behest of a third party, the
employer must do its best to avoid or mitigate any injustice to the
employee. For example, where employees work for a company
providing a service to a local authority or other contracting authority,
the authority often reserves the right to veto the continued
employment of any of the contractor’s staff. If the veto causes
injustice to the employee who has not done anything serious enough
to warrant dismissal, the contractor should do its best to change the
authority’ mind or to find alternative employment.141

Dismissals on transfer of an undertaking

Overview
7.82

7.83

Depending on the facts, a dismissal of an employee on or after the
transfer of an undertaking for an economic, technical or
organisational (ETO) reason entailing changes in the workforce of
either the transferor or transferee is treated either as a redundancy
dismissal or as dismissal for a substantial reason of a kind that can
justify dismissal.142
Dismissals at the time of a transfer usually arise out of the desire
of the buyer or seller or both to reduce the workforce or their terms
and conditions so as to make the business a more valuable asset.
The reasonableness test: ERA 1996 s98(4)

7.84

Dismissals connected with a transfer are automatically unfair unless
for an ETO reason entailing a change in the workforce. If they are for
such a reason, they may be fair or unfair, depending on the facts in
the usual way. For more detail, see chapter 10.

Redundant employees have a right to reasonable time off to
look for work during the notice period.
An employee who is dismissed for redundancy may be entitled
to statutory redundancy pay.
An employee who is put on short-time working or laid off
without pay may resign and claim statutory redundancy pay if
s/he follows the correct procedure.
Even where there is a genuine redundancy situation, the
employee may have been unfairly dismissed.
A redundancy dismissal may be unfair if there has been
inadequate consultation by the employer or unfair selection for
dismissal. Larger employers will be expected to have more
sophisticated selection criteria than small ones. Criteria should
be possible to measure objectively.
Length of service used to be a common selection criterion, but
can be discriminatory.
The employer is expected to offer any available alternative
employment which the employee is capable of doing.
Where old jobs are replaced by newly designed jobs,
particularly at a higher level, the selection process can be
more forward-looking and assess whether the employee can
do the new job.
Watch out for direct and indirect discrimination against black
and minority ethnic workers, women and pregnant women, or
discrimination related to any of the other protected
characteristics under the Equality Act 2010, eg disability,
sexual orientation, religion or age.
See interview checklist in appendix A at A4.

General guide to useful evidence

•
•

•

•

Get copies of all minutes, notes and memoranda of meetings
at which the redundancy dismissal was discussed.
Get a list of all workers who could have been selected for
redundancy; ascertain who was retained. In a discrimination
claim, try to discover when they started their employment, why
they have been kept on, and how they met the selection
criteria.
Find out all vacancies available shortly before and after the
dismissal (including the whole of the notice period) to see
whether the worker could have done any of them.
Find out from those workers who are still employed, what
happened to the worker’s job after the dismissal. Was the
worker simply replaced? If so, find out who the new worker is,
and get a copy of the job advert and the letter of appointment.

Introduction
8.1

An employee who is made redundant may claim statutory redundancy
pay. Some employees have a greater contractual entitlement, and
much of the public sector has its own schemes. An employee may be
able to get additional compensation if s/he has a claim for unfair
dismissal and/or discrimination because of one of the nine protected
characteristics under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010, ie: age;
disability; gender reassignment; marital or civil partnership status;
pregnancy or maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; or sexual
orientation. An adviser must be careful because the time limits are
different for each of these claims. The time limit to claim redundancy
pay from the employment tribunal (ET) is fairly relaxed. Within six
months of the termination date, the employee must either claim the
pay in the ET or make a written claim to the employer or lodge an
unfair dismissal claim.1 However, if the employee wants to claim
unfair dismissal or discrimination at the same time, s/he must meet
the three-month time limit for these latter claims. The Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) early conciliation
(EC) procedure (see para 20.16) applies to all these claims. See

appendix A at A4 for an interview checklist applicable to a
redundant employee.

The definition of ‘redundancy’
Overview
8.2

In broad terms, there are three main redundancy situations:
1) closure of the business as a whole;
2) closure of the particular workplace where the employee was employed; and
3) reduction in the size of the workforce.

The statutory definitions are a little more complex.2

Closure of the business
8.3

Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s139(1) states:
… an employee who is dismissed shall be taken to be dismissed by reason of redundancy if
the dismissal is wholly or mainly attributable to–
(a) the fact that his employer has ceased or intends to cease–
(i)

to carry on the business for the purposes of which the employee was
employed …

The closure may be permanent or temporary,3 eg, closure of a
restaurant for refurbishment.

Closure of the workplace
8.4

A dismissal is deemed to be for redundancy if it is attributable
wholly or mainly to the fact that the employer ‘has ceased or intends
to cease … to carry on that business in the place where the employee
was so employed’.4 The employee is dismissed for redundancy if
dismissed when his/her own workplace closes, even if under the
contract s/he could be required to work elsewhere.5 For example, an
employee working in one branch of a restaurant or retail chain is
dismissed when his/her branch closes, even though there is a
mobility clause in his/her contract.

8.5

The employee needs to be careful if, instead of being made
redundant, s/he is instructed to work at a different location or branch.
If the employee refuses, s/he may lose his/her redundancy pay
because s/he has refused an offer of suitable alternative employment
(below). Also, if the employee refuses a move when there is a
mobility clause, s/he may be dismissed for misconduct rather than
redundancy. There is nothing to stop an employer invoking a mobility
clause to avoid redundancy payments.6 A mobility clause is one
which means the worker can be contractually required to move
workplace, eg: ‘Your place of work is at (address). However, you
may also be required to work at any other company premises within
reasonable travelling distance of your home.’

Reduction of the workforce
8.6

It is a dismissal for redundancy where it is:
… wholly or mainly attributable to …
(b) the fact that the requirements of that business–
(i)

for employees to carry out work of a particular kind, or

(ii) … to carry out work of a particular kind in the place where the employee was
employed by the employer,
have ceased or diminished or are expected to cease or diminish.7

8.7

This is where, for whatever reason, the employer wants fewer
employees doing a particular kind of work. There need not
necessarily be less work to be done.8 The employer may just have
decided to cut costs by reducing staff and making those remaining do
more work. As long as the employee is dismissed as a result of the
employer’s diminished requirements, s/he is dismissed for
redundancy, regardless of what kind of work s/he actually did or
could be required to do under his/her contract.9
It is obviously a redundancy situation where the employer wants
fewer employees overall. It is less clear where the employer retains
the same number of employees, but on different work from before. It
is redundancy if a particular type of job has disappeared altogether,
but if it has simply been altered or modernised, eg, by technology,

this may not be the case. The test is whether the changed job requires
different aptitudes, skill or knowledge.10 It can also be a redundancy
dismissal if the employer dismisses an employee because there is
less work to do and the employee won’t accept a cut in his/her hours
– for example if a full-time worker is dismissed and replaced by a
part-time worker because there is only half as much work to do.11
Finally, an employer may offer a redundant employee another
employee’s job. The other employee is then treated as dismissed for
redundancy.12 This process is known as ‘bumping’ and usually
occurs in recognition of long service, though it occurs only rarely
now.13

8.8

Redundancy payments
Introduction
An employee dismissed on the ground of redundancy is entitled to
statutory redundancy pay if s/he meets the necessary eligibility
requirements, ie:

8.9

•

s/he is an employee;

•

s/he has at least two years’ continuous service; and

•

s/he has been dismissed for redundancy.

It may not be clear whether the employee has actually been
dismissed. Notifying an employee that his/her post will be deleted is
not necessarily the same as terminating his/her contract of
employment.14 The dismissal then needs to be for redundancy
reasons. This is presumed, unless disproved, if the employee makes
a tribunal claim for a statutory redundancy payment.15 The employee
risks losing his/her redundancy pay if s/he is given notice and leaves
before the notice period expires. In such a case, s/he may need to
follow the special procedure set out in ERA 1996 s136(3)–(4). The
calculation of statutory redundancy pay is set out at para 18.22.
There is also a lesser known right whereby a tribunal can order an
employer to pay an employee an appropriate amount as
compensation if the employee suffers any financial loss as a result of

non-payment of his/her redundancy entitlement.16 Workers who have
the status of employee shareholders are unable to claim statutory
redundancy pay.17 The government plans at some stage to bring in
regulations to impose an upper limit on the amount public sector
employees can be paid in exit payments including redundancy pay,
notice pay and ex gratia payments.18 A cap was briefly introduced in
November 2020 and then revoked with retrospective effect in March
2021.19

Suitable alternative employment
Overview
8.10

The employee will lose his/her statutory redundancy pay if s/he
unreasonably refused an offer of suitable alternative employment.20
What constitutes a valid offer?

8.11

8.12

The offer of alternative employment must be made before the
previous employment ends and the new job must start immediately or
within four weeks of the end of that employment. The offer need not
be in writing, but it will be for the employer to prove that a suitable
offer was made.21 If the employee says s/he is not interested in
receiving any alternative offer and the employer therefore does not
make one, the employee will not be taken to have unreasonably
refused a suitable offer and will be entitled to a redundancy
payment.22 The offer must set out the main terms of the new job in
enough detail to show how it differs from the old one23 and the
starting date should be clear.
If the employee accepts the offer, s/he is treated for redundancy
purposes as never having been dismissed.24 However, s/he can still
claim unfair dismissal from the original job.25 S/he may want to do
this if, eg, his/her pay in the new job is lower.
The statutory trial period

8.13

Where the employee is offered an alternative job as above, s/he can
try out the new job, where it differs from the old one, for a trial
period of up to four weeks.26 If s/he leaves or gives notice to leave
within this period, the original redundancy dismissal stands and s/he
can still claim redundancy pay.27 The trial period starts on the date
the employee begins the new job and ends four calendar weeks later,
by which time the employee must have decided whether to accept the
new job permanently. If the employee works beyond the four-week
period, s/he will lose the right to claim redundancy pay. It is
irrelevant whether the employee is unable to work the four weeks,
eg, because s/he is off sick or the workplace is closed for
Christmas.28 However, an offer of a different alternative job will
attract another four-week trial period. The four-week trial period is
a strict time limit and can be extended only by agreement for the
purpose of retraining the employee; such agreement must be in
writing and specify a new date when the trial period will end.29
Unreasonable refusal of a suitable offer

8.14

The employer must prove both that the offer was suitable and that the
employee’s refusal was unreasonable. ‘Suitability’ tends to mean
objective job-related factors such as pay, status, hours and location.
The reasonableness of a refusal depends more on the employee’s
individual circumstances, eg, domestic factors and health. A very
common form of alternative offer is of the same job but in a different
location. Whether this is a suitable offer which the employee cannot
reasonably refuse depends on a combination of factors such as extra
travelling time and expense, childcare responsibilities, health and
status of the job (the higher the status, the more an ET would expect
an employee to travel). If an employee is going to refuse a job
because of travel difficulties, it is important that s/he knows
precisely what the travel would entail. It may also be helpful at least
to try it out. It is not for the tribunal to impose its own view on
whether the refusal of the offer was reasonable. Nor is the test
whether a reasonable employee would have accepted the offer. It
must be looked at from the viewpoint of the particular employee

concerned. Did s/he have good reasons for refusing the offer given
his/her particular circumstances, even if his/her view might not be
shared by others.30 Moreover, an employee’s desire to take
advantage of his/her redundancy rights does not necessarily defeat a
claim if s/he has given proper consideration to the job on offer.

Lay-off and short-time
8.15

Normally an employee can claim statutory redundancy pay only if
s/he is dismissed for redundancy. This includes constructive
dismissal – for example, if s/he resigns due to a fundamental breach
of contract, such as being sent home without pay, when under his/her
contract this is not permitted. However, there is a problem if an
employee has a contract which allows him/her to be temporarily laid
off without pay or put on short-time working (ie fewer hours), with a
consequent cut in pay. This situation could carry on indefinitely,
without the employee being able to sue for his/her lost wages or
resign and claim redundancy pay. There are therefore special
statutory rules which cover this situation once the employee has been
laid off or put on short-time for at least four consecutive weeks or
six weeks in a 13-week period. There is a specified procedure
involving notices and counter-notices which enables the employee to
resign and claim redundancy pay.31 If the employer has no money to
pay the redundancy pay, this can be recovered from the Insolvency
Service.32

Guarantee pay
8.16

Where an employee is not provided with work on any day when s/he
would normally be required to work under his/her contract because
of lesser requirements of the employer’s business for the employee’s
type of work, s/he may be entitled to a small guarantee payment from
his/her employer. The rules are set out in ERA 1996 ss28–35. This
sum is a minimum and is set off against any contractual wages to
which the employee is entitled.33 The maximum amount of guarantee

pay in the year starting 6 April 2021 is £30 per day for five days in
any three-month period.34

Unfair redundancy dismissal
Overview
8.17

A dismissal for redundancy may be automatically unfair on one of the
specified grounds, eg selecting a woman for redundancy because she
is pregnant.35 Alternatively, it may be unfair on general principles for
one or more of the following reasons:
a)

there was no genuine redundancy situation;

b)

the employer failed to consult;

c)

the employee was unfairly selected; or

d)

the employer failed to offer alternative employment.

The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in Williams v Compair
Maxam Ltd36 set out guidelines for the fair handling of redundancy
dismissals. It is not necessarily unfair to fail to follow the guidelines
in every case, but they do provide a useful standard. For general
principles on unfair dismissal, including unfair dismissal on grounds
of redundancy, see chapter 6.

No genuine redundancy situation
8.18

An employee cannot challenge whether the employer acted
reasonably in creating the redundancy situation. The ET cannot
investigate the commercial and economic reasons which prompted a
closure or look into the rights and wrongs of the employer’s
decision.37 However, an ET is entitled to investigate whether the
redundancy situation is in fact genuine.

Failure to consult
8.19

The employer should give as much warning as possible of impending
redundancies to enable the union and affected employees to consider

8.20

8.21

8.22

possible alternative solutions and if necessary, find alternative
employment.38
The statutory right to collective consultation for redundancies of
20 or more is set out at para 8.43 below. This section is concerned
with the right not to be unfairly dismissed and is referring to the
significance of consultation in the context of an individual unfair
dismissal claim. Consultation is very important in redundancy
situations and can take many forms. At one end of the spectrum, it
involves collective discussions and meetings with the union; at the
other end, it will entail discussions with individual employees who
are likely to be made redundant. Failure to consult individually may
well make a dismissal unfair, although compensation may be limited
if consultation would not have made any difference to the outcome.39
Consultation requires the employer to consider options which
would not involve making the employee redundant, including early
retirement, seeking volunteers, alternative employment, lay-off and
short-time working. The employees and their representatives should
be involved in this process. Consultation means more than
communicating a decision already made. The Industrial Relations
Code of Practice,40 which has been repealed, provided a good
definition of consultation. It defined consultation as jointly examining
and discussing problems of concern to both management and
employees. It involves seeking mutually acceptable solutions through
a genuine exchange of views and information.41 Furthermore, the
courts have held that fair consultation involves consultation when the
proposals are still at a formative stage, there is adequate information
on which to respond, adequate time in which to respond, and
conscientious consideration by an authority of the response to
consultation.42
Although failure to follow the statutory rules on collective
consultation will not in itself make the dismissal of an individual
employee unfair, the failure to consult collectively is one factor
which can be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of
the dismissal.43 On the other hand, even if there has been union
consultation, it is normally important that the employer has also

consulted the individual employees. Collective consultation tends to
concentrate on matters such as choice of selection criteria and how
the process will take effect, whereas individuals want the
opportunity to make representations on their own position,44 eg how
they should be assessed against the criteria and suggestions for
alternative employment. An employee does not necessarily have to
be given his/her particular scores, but it depends on the
circumstances. What is important is that s/he is given sufficient
information to challenge, correct and supplement the information
which the employer may have wrongly taken into account or not
known about when making the assessment.45 Where there is no union
or collective consultation, individuals should also get the chance to
comment on the process and choice of selection criteria.

Unfair selection
8.23

8.24

As a first stage, the employer must choose a fair pool from which to
select the redundant employees. Employers have a lot of flexibility in
deciding on a pool, provided they apply their mind to it and act from
genuine motives.46 However, it could be unreasonable to restrict the
pool artificially, eg, by not including all those doing similar work. It
should not be automatically assumed that if a particular post is
deleted, the post-holder is the one to go,47 but in some situations that
is the only obvious candidate. Whether a subordinate employee
whose post is to be retained should be included in the pool will
depend on factors such as: whether the post-holder is willing to
accept the more junior role at a reduced salary; the difference in
salary between the two posts; the difference in the jobs; the relative
length of service of the two employees; and the qualifications of the
employee in danger of redundancy.48
Once a reasonable pool is chosen, the employer can choose any
reasonable selection criteria, provided these can be objectively
measured and are not discriminatory. Ideally the employer should try
to agree the criteria with the union, if there is one.49 It is common
these days to use multiple selection criteria, which often include
length of service,50 productivity (if it can be objectively assessed),

8.25

timekeeping, the employee’s adaptability and the employer’s future
needs. Length of service is less popular nowadays, especially if it
has discriminatory effect. If attendance is one of the criteria, it
should be judged over a substantial period, particularly for longstanding employees. It may in some circumstances be unreasonable
not to look at the reasons behind each employee’s absence,51 but this
would be unusual. Vague criteria such as ‘attitude to work’ could be
unreasonable.52 Certain criteria may also be discriminatory.53
Having chosen fair selection criteria, the employer must apply
these fairly and objectively. A reasonable criterion such as ‘merit’
can be challenged if it is not judged in an objective manner.
Unfortunately, it is hard to challenge the employer’s assessment of
the employees against the various criteria. An ET is not going to
embark on its own exercise of re-marking all the candidates. Rather
than checking whether marks were valid, an ET will be looking at
the process and how marks were arrived at, ie whether there was a
structured scoring process, carried out with an open mind and
assessment done by informed managers who relied on solid
evidence, eg appraisals, statistics or views of other managers. To
challenge an assessment score, the claimant needs strong evidence
that it does not make sense, eg giving an extremely low mark for
product knowledge to a long-standing salesperson when there has
been little change in the design of goods sold.54 The ET will not
order disclosure of the assessment forms of all employees in the
selection pool unless it is clear from the tribunal claim why these are
relevant and why the redundancy is unfair.55 Nevertheless, the ET
does not simply have to accept the employer’s assertion that it has
applied its selection criteria fairly.56 An ET does need to know how
the claimant’s markings compare with those of the retained
employees in deciding whether the employer acted reasonably.
Disclosure or additional information regarding all the employees in
the redundancy selection pool can therefore be relevant.57 In
discrimination cases, an employee may well be entitled to more
detailed comparable information.

8.26

8.27

The lengths to which the ET expects an employer to go in drawing
up and applying criteria will depend on the employer’s size and
administrative resources.58 Usually the ET expects a medium or
large employer to have adopted a methodical approach, awarding
each potentially redundant employee with points against various
criteria and dismissing those who score least.59 This selection
process, provided it is consistent and measured objectively, will in
most cases justify the dismissal. However, even small employers
must show that they used a fair selection method. Although a more
forward-looking recruitment-style process may be appropriate where
new jobs have been created on a reorganisation,60 this is unlikely to
be appropriate in a traditional redundancy selection process for
existing jobs where emphasis is more on assessment of past
performance.61
In some circumstances, a tribunal may expect an employer to
consider dismissing an employee who works in a non-redundant post
to make way for an employee of greater suitability who works in a
redundant post.62 This is called ‘bumping’. Whether it is unfair to
fail even to consider bumping very much depends on the facts,63 and
the claimant would have to show, not only that there were powerful
reasons to prefer him/her over the bumped employee, but that s/he
could easily slot in and undertake the bumped employee’s work. See
para 8.23 where a senior post is deleted and a more junior employee
might be dismissed to make way for the senior post-holder. Bumping
may be expected if it has happened regularly in the past.64 Moreover,
the bumped employee may be able to claim that s/he has him/herself
been unfairly dismissed, again depending on the facts.65

Failure to offer alternative employment
8.28

Employers must take reasonable steps to avoid or minimise
redundancy by redeployment within their own organisation.66 They
must therefore look for alternative employment and should offer any
suitable available vacancies. Employees at risk of redundancy
should usually be given priority over external candidates for suitable

8.29

8.30

8.31

vacancies.67 An employer’s duty is not limited to offering similar
positions or positions in the same workplace and s/he should
consider the availability of any vacancies with associated
employers.68 However, failing to put a redundant employee on a bank
of non-employees who have no employment rights is unlikely to
make a dismissal unfair, even if the employer uses the bank quite
frequently.69
When offering alternative employment, the employer must give
sufficient detail of the vacancy and, unless the job functions are
obvious, allow a trial period. Failure to do so is likely to make the
dismissal unfair.70 It is up to the employee whether to accept the
alternative employment, which might even involve demotion or a
reduction in pay.71 Employers should consult about possibilities and
not make assumptions about what jobs an employee would find
acceptable.
Employees who unreasonably refuse a suitable alternative offer
will reduce their chances of winning an unfair dismissal case or
receiving full compensation if they do win. They will also lose their
entitlement to statutory redundancy pay (see above).
One of the main purposes of consultation is to consider other
employment, eg, transfer to another workplace, as an alternative to
dismissal. The ET will look at vacancies existing during the
consultation period (regardless of whether there was actual
consultation) and during the employee’s notice period as well as at
the time of dismissal itself. For relevant evidence in an unfair
redundancy dismissal, see para 9.16.

Reorganisation and new jobs
8.32

Where the employer reorganises so that the old roles disappear and
are replaced by new jobs, the approach can be different. Whereas
traditional redundancy selection involves consultation and
assessment of past performance to some degree, appointment to new
roles is more forward-looking and can legitimately rely on something
like an interview process to assess employees’ ability to perform in
the new roles.72 This is especially so if the new job is at a high level

and involves promotion. Even if there are sufficient vacancies to
match the number of potentially redundant employees, it may well be
fair for an employer to make an employee redundant if s/he is unable
to meet the standard required for the new job. The tribunal will still
look to see whether a fair process was followed and whether there
was any indication of bias. A dismissal could be unfair if the new
job is very similar to the disappearing job, or if the employer does
not abide by a collective agreement to slot in displaced staff without
competition.73 It is also arguable that, even if the employer is entitled
to test the redundant employee’s capability to carry out the new job,
the employee should be assessed before the post is opened up to
external applications.74 Although this different kind of redundancy
process is common nowadays where there are public sector
reorganisations, the tribunal will still consider whether all aspects of
the dismissal (consultation, right of appeal etc) were within the band
of reasonable responses.75

Redundancy and discrimination
Pregnancy/maternity dismissals
8.33

Selection for redundancy dismissal due to pregnancy, maternity or a
related reason is automatically unfair and no minimum qualifying
service is required to make a claim. Where a woman is made
redundant while pregnant or on maternity leave, but not due to that
fact, the normal test of fairness applies. However, a woman made
redundant on maternity leave must be offered any suitable available
vacancy, however inconvenient for the employer.76 Failure to do this
is automatically unfair dismissal. The same applies to employees on
adoption leave or shared parental leave. Redundancy selection due
to pregnancy or maternity may also be sex discrimination under the
EqA 2010. See para 11.1 onwards regarding pregnancy dismissals.

Race discrimination – direct
8.34

In any case where a black, Asian or other minority ethnic worker, or
someone born abroad, has been selected for redundancy, it is worth

checking that there has been no direct discrimination. Indications
may be the racial composition of those made redundant as compared
with those retained. It is essential to ascertain why the employer says
the worker has been selected. A common indicator of direct race
discrimination is where retained white workers score equally badly
or worse on the selection criteria. Direct discrimination may also
occur because of other protected characteristics, eg religion, age, sex
or sexual orientation. For evidence to prove direct discrimination,
see chapter 16.

Indirectly discriminatory selection criteria
Criteria for selecting which workers are made redundant are
frequently indirectly discriminatory.77 Criteria such as hours worked,
flexibility, mobility or attendance records could adversely affect
women. Black workers may suffer from criteria based on conduct
records, internal appraisals or customer complaints, if they have
been subjected to direct discrimination in those areas. Unjustifiable
selection of a part-time worker would be a breach of the Part-time
Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations
2000.78 The selection first of workers on temporary or short fixedterm contracts may be unjustifiable indirect race or sex
discrimination under the EqA 2010.79

8.35

Last in, first out (LIFO)
Length of service is still sometimes applied as a means of
redundancy selection. Although in many workplaces this requirement
clearly disadvantages women, young people and black and other
minority ethnic workers, it is a traditional selection method which
has often been found justifiable in the past. Where LIFO has an
obvious adverse impact, the following approach should be taken to
challenge its justifiability:

8.36

•

The higher the proportion of black and women workers made redundant due to the
application of this criterion, the stronger the necessary justification from the employer.80

•

The employer must show that the use of LIFO serves a real business need. Nowadays
employers’ main concern is to retain a balanced and flexible workforce.81 This need is
unlikely to be served by overemphasis on length of service.

•

Current working practices show that workers are employed increasingly on short-term and
temporary contracts and little premium is placed on long service by employers.

•

The mere fact that a particular requirement has been widely used in the past does not
make it justifiable now. Nor should it be an objective justification that LIFO is or was
preferred by certain trade union negotiators.

Use of the criterion may be hard to challenge as indirect age
discrimination if it is simply one of several selection criteria,
especially as redundancy selection criteria may be considered a
‘benefit’ in age discrimination law under the EqA 2010, which
requires a lower level of justification by the employer.82

Redundancy and disability
8.37

8.38

A disabled worker may be selected for redundancy because of
failure to make reasonable adjustments to allow for his/her
disability. For example, s/he may not score well on selection criteria
such as hours worked, flexibility, mobility or sickness record. S/he
may be unable to fulfil new flexible working practices or multiple
duties. The employer needs to make appropriate reasonable
adjustments by modifying selection criteria, eg by being careful not
to hold it against a disabled worker that s/he has refused to work
overtime in the past.
The employer may be expected to take a more active role in
seeking appropriate alternative employment than may be required of
an employer under ordinary unfair dismissal law. The duty to make
reasonable adjustments applies to any suitable vacancies, eg
modifications to equipment or provision of training. Chapter 15
deals with disability discrimination generally.

Preventing discriminatory dismissals
8.39

In rare cases, it may be possible to prevent a public employer
embarking on a discriminatory redundancy selection policy by means

of an application for judicial review in the High Court; it will be
necessary clearly to establish that the policy definitely has
discriminatory effect and on a fairly widespread basis.83 With public
authorities, it is arguable that they should carry out an ‘equality
impact assessment’ before deciding what criteria to choose.84

Time off to look for work
8.40

8.41

An employee who is being made redundant, and who has been
continuously employed for at least two years, has the right to
reasonable time off during the notice period to look for a new job or
make training arrangements for future employment.85 It is irrelevant
whether the employee has turned down an offer of suitable
alternative employment.86 It is not necessary to have concrete job
interviews; the time can be used going into job centres, for example.
There is no statutory requirement to give the employer proof of
where s/he has been, though this may be relevant to whether the time
was ‘reasonable’.
There is no set amount of time which the employee can have off. It
is a question of what is reasonable, balancing the employer’s needs
against the employee’s. However, the employee is only entitled to be
paid for a maximum of two-fifths of a week’s pay for time off taken
during the whole notice period. The employer must give the time off
during working hours and cannot ask the employee to rearrange
his/her hours or make up the time.87

Collective consultation
8.42

There are special rules under Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992 ss188–198, whereby an employer must
inform and consult with the appropriate representatives of any
employees who may be affected by proposed redundancy dismissals
or by measures taken in connection with those dismissals. The duty
arises when an employer is proposing to dismiss as redundant 20 or
more employees at one establishment within a period of 90 days or
less. If the employer fails to inform or consult, the trade union or

employee representative (as applicable) can bring a claim for
compensation on behalf of the employees. This is known as a
‘protective award’. Individual employees can only bring a claim for
failure to inform or consult if there is no union or elected employee
representative. As with all claims, it is important when writing the
tribunal claim form to be clear if a claim for failure to inform and
consult is being made under the 1992 Act, as distinct from other
claims which may also be itemised on the form, eg unfair dismissal.
For more detail, see chapter 2.

Redundancy and the Covid-19 pandemic
8.43

8.44

8.45

Unfortunately, the economic effect of the Covid-19 pandemic is
likely to lead to a wave of redundancies. Employers will still need
to follow fair and non-discriminatory selection procedures. Broadly
speaking, redundancy and notice pay should be calculated on the
basis of normal pay and not any reduction in pay during periods of
furlough.
In relation to discrimination, the Equality and Human Rights
Commission (EHRC) has advised that certain redundancy selection
criteria could indirectly discriminate against groups who have taken
disproportionate time off due to coronavirus, eg women who have
disproportionately taken on caring responsibilities or disabled
employees who have had to shield. Problematic criteria might be
sick leave taken during the pandemic; unpaid leave; productivity
during the pandemic; working part-time; previously having been
furloughed.88
In terms of unfair dismissal, one uncertainty is to what extent it can
be argued that employers should have put employees on furlough
(while it was available) rather than making them redundant. As
always, the test is whether a reasonable employer could have
decided to dismiss. Relevant considerations are likely to be whether
the employer might be able to survive an interim shortfall of work or
was on the point of collapse anyway; whether there was any longerterm prospect of the employee being able to be offered work;
whether the employee was willing to agree furlough and a reduction

of pay to the level of the 80 per cent grant; and what was happening
with other employees. In one early case,89 a tribunal found a
dismissal unfair because the employer did not even consider placing
the employee, a care worker, on furlough. She was made redundant
because the amount of live-in work had reduced significantly due to
Covid-19 and the company had no immediate work for her to do. The
tribunal said this was exactly the type of situation that the furlough
scheme had envisaged, and the employer had not explained why
furlough was not considered suitable or even considered.

In an unfair dismissal claim, if dismissal is disputed, it is the
employee who must prove it had taken place.
The employer must then prove the reason why s/he dismissed
the employee.
An employee’s secret recordings are not always helpful, but
the employment tribunal (ET) does have power to listen to
them if relevant. If producing a recording, the employee must
prepare a transcript of the relevant sections and ask the
employer to agree it is accurate in advance of the hearing.
It may not breach an employee’s human rights for an employer
to gain evidence by covert surveillance; nor will it necessarily
make a dismissal unfair.
Verbal or written negotiations aimed at settling potential or
actual litigation cannot usually be referred to at a tribunal
hearing, though it is safer to use the words ‘without prejudice’
to make sure this is the case.
Negotiations through the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS), whether during the early conciliation (EC)
process or during case preparation, cannot be referred to at a
tribunal hearing.
‘Legal advice privilege’ keeps confidential communications
between a client and professional legal adviser, even if
litigation is not envisaged. This does not apply to employment
consultants or other non-lawyers.
‘Litigation privilege’ keeps confidential communications
between a client, his/her adviser and third parties, eg
witnesses or medical experts, which come into existence for
the purpose of actual or contemplated litigation.
Parties can inadvertently or deliberately lose (‘waive’) their
own right to insist on such confidentiality by referring to
something which was said ‘without prejudice’ or during

•

•

•

privileged communications. The other side can insist on
maintaining confidentiality.
The statutory rules on ‘protected conversations’ keep
confidential from ordinary unfair dismissal hearings (though not
automatic unfair dismissal or discrimination hearings) offers
made and discussions held between an employer and
employee before the termination of employment with a view to
termination on agreed terms. This can cover conversations
which would not otherwise fall into ‘without prejudice’ or
privileged categories.
Confidentiality on ‘protected conversations’ will not apply to
anything improper which is said or if improper pressure is
applied.
Unlike other types of privilege, confidentiality cannot be waived
on ‘protected conversations’, even if both sides agree.

Burden of proof
9.1

If dismissal is disputed, the burden is on the employee to prove that
it occurred. Once dismissal is proved, the employer must show the
reason (or if there is more than one reason, the principal reason) for
the dismissal and that it was one of the potentially fair reasons set
out in Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s98. In cases where the
employee claims automatic unfair dismissal, s/he will need to
provide evidence which helps prove that the dismissal was for the
automatically unfair reason.1

What kind of evidence is helpful?
Proving a disputed dismissal
9.2

If the employee seeks advice shortly after dismissal, it is essential to
see any letter of dismissal. In any event, the employer should be
asked under ERA 1996 s92 for confirmation of the dismissal and the
written reasons for it.2 Where dismissal is during pregnancy, the

9.3

9.4

employers should automatically supply such a statement, whether
requested or not, but it is worth asking if they do not.3
If there is a dispute whether the employee was actually dismissed,
supporting documents and witnesses will be needed. As early as
possible, try to obtain a signed statement plus the name and address
of any witnesses to the dismissal. If the employer decided to dismiss
before the employee knew about it, any documentary proof will be
helpful, eg a copy of job advertisements which had already appeared
for the employee’s job.
If advising on a potential constructive dismissal claim, where the
employee must show a fundamental breach of contract, all
contractual documents must be obtained. These may comprise a letter
of appointment, statement of main terms and conditions under ERA
1996 s1, notices of variation of contract4 and staff handbook. Also
obtain the employee’s resignation letter. If s/he resigned without
putting anything in writing, it is important to write a letter as soon as
possible, setting out what happened, unless it is now so long since
the resignation that it would look very odd.

Conduct and capability dismissals
Overview
9.5

In the vast majority of conduct cases and many capability cases, the
tribunal will start by considering whether the employer has
adequately followed the three stages of the Burchell test, and will
then consider whether dismissal was a fair sanction.5 Fair
procedures will be part of the consideration on fairness. It is
therefore useful to consider what evidence is necessary by reference
to these stages. In relation to Burchell, try to find out a) from the
documents, b) from what the employee knows him/herself, c) from
what is written in the employer’s ET3, and ultimately d) from
questioning the employer’s witnesses at the tribunal hearing, what
steps the employer took to investigate the alleged offence. You
should also try to establish from the same sources what evidence the
employer relied on in reaching the decision to dismiss. In general,

9.6

what is important is what the employer knew or ought to have known,
had s/he properly investigated at the time of dismissal. Therefore
establish what the employee told the employer, or would have told
the employer if s/he had had the chance. Evidence which only
emerged after the dismissal or which is brought up for the first time
at the tribunal hearing is not relevant to whether the dismissal was
unfair unless, for example, the employee was prevented from putting
such evidence forward at the time because s/he was not given the
chance to answer the allegations.
There are often disputes about whether the minutes of the
disciplinary or appeal hearing are accurate. It is important to keep
sight of whether any inaccuracies are important in relation to what a
tribunal has to decide. The tribunal will not want to get bogged down
in disputes over minor details. On the other hand, the minutes of the
disciplinary hearing may provide evidence as to important matters
such as what charges were put to the employee, what explanation the
employee gave at the time, what other witnesses said on key points
and any procedural request, eg for an adjournment. Usually the
formal minutes have been taken by the employer and you should
obtain a copy. If the employer provides typed minutes, ask for the
original hand-written notes too. The employee or his/her witness
may also have written their own minutes. Check whether the
employer asked the employee at the time to agree the accuracy of the
minutes and if so, how long after the disciplinary hearing this
happened and whether the employee noted any disagreement. If the
employee has not yet seen the minutes, get these as soon as possible,
while his/her memory is still fresh and s/he can check their accuracy.
Also take a statement from the employee immediately as to the key
aspects of the disciplinary and appeal hearings. If there is no serious
dispute between the parties as to what was said at the disciplinary
and appeal, it is unnecessary to ask the tribunal to read the full
minutes. The key points can just be summarised in the witness
statements. If there is an important dispute, identify the key sections
of the minutes which the tribunal should be asked to read and, if
handwritten, make sure they are legible. If not, ask the notetaker to

type up the minutes prior to the tribunal hearing. Do not ask the
tribunal to read the full minutes, which often consist of pages and
pages of repetition, irrelevant side-issues, incoherence and
unnecessary detail. See para 9.17 regarding tape recordings of the
hearing.
Regarding fair procedures, the employee should be asked:

9.7
•

what investigative and disciplinary hearings took place;

•

who was present;

•

whether s/he was advised s/he could bring a representative;

•

how much warning s/he was given of the hearing;

•

whether s/he knew what it would be about in advance;

•

whether she was shown the key evidence against him/her before the meeting; and

•

whether s/he was warned that dismissal was a possible outcome.

Obtain:
•

the letters inviting the employee to the disciplinary and appeal hearings;

•

any grievance investigation reports; and

•

copies of any evidence, eg statements which s/he was given in advance or during the
hearing.

9.8

Ask the employee at what point in the meeting s/he was told that s/he
was dismissed. If the employer said something at the start of the
hearing to indicate that the decision to dismiss had already been
taken, this would be unfair. It is surprising how often the letter of
dismissal has been typed prior to the disciplinary meeting, which is a
strong indication that the hearing was a sham. The relevant
provisions of the contract of employment or staff handbook should
also be examined, in particular check the notice provisions, the
disciplinary procedure and, if relevant, which offences are listed as
disciplinary matters and what amounts to gross misconduct.
Ascertain whether the contractual procedures were in fact followed.
Check the reasons for dismissal and for rejecting any appeal.
These are usually set out in the letter of dismissal and the appeal
outcome letter. The tribunal will read the letters, listen to the
evidence and consider what were the true reasons. It is then a matter

9.9

of whether a reasonable employer, relying on the evidence which
was before this particular employer, could reasonably have
dismissed for those reasons. In connection with the appeal, establish
the employee’s grounds of appeal from any letter of appeal written
by him/her or as put forward verbally in the appeal meeting as
recorded in the minutes. Consider whether the appeals officer
properly considered the grounds of appeal, as evidenced by his/her
areas of questioning at the appeal (again, check the minutes) and the
reasons for refusing the appeal, which will probably be set out in a
letter.
One of the considerations relevant to whether dismissal was a fair
sanction, may be whether the employee had a clean disciplinary
record. Find out whether the employee has received any written or
verbal warnings in the past, particularly concerning the matter for
which s/he was dismissed. Copies of the written warnings should be
obtained. With verbal warnings, check when they were given, by
whom and roughly what was said. Under some procedures, verbal
warnings are recorded in writing. For dismissals for poor
performance, seek documents and information to establish the nature
of the criticisms by the employer, whether and when these were taken
up with the employee, and obtain relevant letters of complaint or
criticism and appraisals. Find out about any training and support
offered. Also obtain any evidence proving the employee did carry
out good work, eg performance-related bonuses or thank you letters
from customers. With sickness, injury, incapability or qualification
dismissals, find out what other jobs the employer had available at the
relevant time.
Absenteeism and lateness

9.10

Ascertain to what extent the employee was made aware of the
employer’s dissatisfaction with his/her attendance and whether it
was made clear that dismissal would follow a failure to improve. If
there was only a general verbal warning, given to a group of
employees, clarify from another of those employees what was said
and whether it was clear that dismissal might ensue. Get copies of

9.11

any written individual or collective warnings which the employee
mentions.
Check whether the employer properly reviewed the employee’s
attendance record prior to giving any warning or dismissal. The
employer should have consulted the employee as to the reasons for
the absences or lateness. In general, consider whether the employer
approached the dismissal of the employee with sympathy and
understanding.
Prolonged sickness absence

9.12

9.13

If the employer obtained a medical opinion on the employee’s state
of health, obtain a copy of the report. It is often important also to get
a copy of the employer’s letter instructing the doctors. Was the
employee consulted in respect of the employer’s medical report? If
so, copies of notes taken of the meeting and a statement from the
employee on what was said should be obtained. Ask the employee
whether s/he was offered the opportunity of getting his/her own
medical report. Get copies of any correspondence with the employee
about this.
Consider the importance of the employee’s job and whether the
employer could be expected to hold it open any longer. What
arrangements were made during the employee’s absence? What other
short-term solutions were possible?6 How soon after the dismissal
was the vacancy filled?
Injury

9.14

Clarify whether the injury was such as to make the performance of
the job impossible. Could the employee, through retraining or the use
of aids, have continued to do the job?7 Was there any consultation
with the employee on the medical prognosis and what s/he could do?
Was the employee warned s/he may be dismissed? Get copies of any
correspondence. If the employee seeks advice while still employed,
the employer may have a beneficial sickness retirement scheme or
medical insurance covering sick pay from which the employee can
claim. Also consider whether the employee should take advice in

respect of a personal/industrial injury claim if the injury occurred at
work.
Qualifications
9.15

Establish whether the qualification was a term of the contract or
otherwise a genuine requirement of the job. If not, the employer will
find it hard to justify dismissal. If the employer has changed the
requirement, why was the change necessary? Are there any other
employees doing the same job who do not have the qualifications,
and are new employees expected to be qualified? Also, find out
whether other jobs were available which the employee was qualified
to do at the time of dismissal. Get copies of all correspondence.
Finally, consider whether the requirement had a discriminatory effect
on the employee (see para 13.27 regarding indirect discrimination).

Redundancy dismissals
9.16

To check whether it was a genuine redundancy, find out whether a
new employee has simply replaced the employee in the same job. If
relevant, find out what selection criteria were adopted by the
employer and how the employee was measured and scored. Were
there other employees in similar jobs who were not made redundant?
It is important to obtain all internal and external advertisements and
vacancy lists relating to suitable vacancies at the time of dismissal
and for a short period before and after. These are relevant both to the
genuineness of the redundancy (advertisements for the same job) and
to the availability of alternative jobs which should have been
offered. The employee should be asked what other jobs s/he could
and would have done for the employer and whether s/he was
consulted about vacancies or doing any other work. Get copies of all
correspondence related to the redundancy. See also para 8.27
regarding documents and information relevant to other employees in
the selection pool where the employee is claiming unfair selection.

Recorded evidence and covert surveillance

9.17

Sometimes employees secretly record conversations, meetings or
disciplinary hearings with their employer. This is a risky strategy as,
if they are found out, it may be a ground for dismissal. There is no
public policy reason why a secret recording of a disciplinary hearing
should not be heard by a tribunal, since the employer has usually
intended that there is a public record of such a meeting in the form of
minutes.8 On the other hand, recordings of the disciplinary panel’s
private deliberations would not usually be allowed as evidence,
except perhaps where they contained the only, or incontrovertible,
proof of discrimination.9 Nevertheless, in one case a tribunal
allowed in secret recordings of comments made by members of a
grievance panel during a break in the grievance hearing.10 Ultimately
the tribunal has to weigh up the relevance of the evidence against the
public policy in allowing deliberations of disciplinary and grievance
panels to be kept confidential. Covert recordings by the employee
may in rare cases breach the employer’s privacy contrary to Article
8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (right to
respect for private and family life, home and correspondence),11 but
the tribunal will probably allow in the evidence if it is necessary for
a fair hearing.12 In practical terms, employees need to decide
whether it is worth using any secret recordings they have obtained.
Usually the tribunal will disapprove of the fact that the employee
acted in an underhand manner and the value of the content needs to
outweigh the bad impression it makes. There is also a risk that the
tribunal will reduce compensation if it thinks the recording was
intended to entrap the employer, although these days, it is so easy just
to press ‘record’ on a mobile phone, that it may just be that the
employee feels flustered or vulnerable, rather than having any
intention to entrap.13 In the context of a disciplinary hearing, where
the employee’s main concern is that minutes will not be accurate, it
is better openly to ask the employer to make a recording, which can
be available to both sides. Bear in mind that recordings can be long,
boring and inconclusive. Moreover, the employee does not always
perform well in a disciplinary hearing. If a recording is to be used,
the employee should prepare a transcript well in advance of the

tribunal hearing and ask the employer to agree that it is accurate. If
the recordings are very long, the employee should be ready to
identify which passages are important, eg because they prove some
crucial evidence was given or allegation made, or because they
reveal the employer’s true state of mind.14 Evidence to prove
misconduct which is obtained by an employer from covert
surveillance, in or outside the workplace, also potentially breaches
Article 8, but not if the employer acted proportionately. Moreover,
even if the tribunal disapproves, it will not make the dismissal unfair
if it was fair to dismiss applying the usual test for misconduct
dismissals.15

Without prejudice, privilege and protected
conversations
Without prejudice
9.18

9.19

Statements and offers made during negotiations, whether in writing
or verbally, are not generally admissible as evidence in tribunals or
courts if they were genuinely aimed at settling a dispute. If an adviser
or employee wants to ensure the content of settlement discussions
cannot be referred to in the tribunal, s/he should write the phrase
‘without prejudice’ at the top of any settlement letter or say it at the
start of any settlement conversation. Even if s/he fails to use the
actual words, it is possible that without prejudice privilege may still
apply. On the other hand, writing the phrase ‘without prejudice’ at
the top of a letter which is not conducting a negotiation will not have
the effect of keeping it off the record.16 Settlement negotiations
through the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS),
whether through the early conciliation (EC) process or during case
preparation, are also kept private from the tribunal.
The reason for the without prejudice rule is public policy in
encouraging settlement negotiations without parties being inhibited in
case the negotiations fall through and they are quoted in the tribunal.
It therefore only applies if there is a genuine dispute. There is
obviously a dispute if a tribunal case has started, but the mere fact

that a worker has brought a grievance may not amount to a dispute
because it could in theory be upheld by the employer.17 Without
prejudice privilege can apply before litigation has started provided
the parties have contemplated – or might reasonably have
contemplated – that litigation will occur if they cannot agree.18 In
rare circumstances, the without prejudice protection will not apply,
eg because it would hide an unambiguous impropriety (see para
16.34 for an example) or because both parties have waived
privilege. The case-law regarding these exceptions can be
complicated and is beyond the scope of this book. The problem with
the without prejudice rule is that employees may need to refer to
something said to them in without prejudice discussions in order to
prove their tribunal case. For example, employees need to be careful
about resigning because of something said during without prejudice
discussions, because they may find they are unable to refer to this in
their constructive dismissal claim.19
Privilege
9.20

The law of privilege is important because it keeps certain
communications private. It can get very complicated, but here are a
few key points. ‘Legal advice privilege’ protects confidential
communications between a client and his/her professional adviser
made for the purpose of giving or seeking legal advice, regardless of
whether litigation is envisaged. For example, it covers conversations
between employers and their solicitors during a disciplinary
process. It applies to the advice of solicitors, barristers or other
lawyers acting in that capacity and not, for example, to advice given
as a friend. It does not apply to advice from non-qualified
employment consultants or other non-lawyers.20 ‘Litigation
privilege’ is different, though both types of privilege can apply in
some situations. It protects confidential communications between a
client, his/her legal adviser (whether or not a qualified lawyer) and a
third party, eg a medical expert or witness, where such
communication comes into existence for the dominant purpose of use
in connection with actual or contemplated litigation. It is not enough

that it is created for another purpose, eg resolving a grievance,
where litigation is only vaguely in mind.21 A party can lose privilege
by ‘waiving’ it, eg by selectively quoting parts of a confidential
document or advice to support his/her case.22 Again, the rules around
this are complex and it is best to be careful.
Protected conversations
9.21

9.22

The law on ‘protected conversations’ was introduced in 2013 to
keep certain discussions off the record which would not otherwise
be caught by the rules on ‘without prejudice’ negotiations and legal
advice or litigation privilege. Under ERA 1996 s111A, evidence of
pre-termination negotiations cannot be referred to in unfair dismissal
claims. This covers any offer made or discussions held, before the
termination of the employment in question, with a view to the
employment being terminated on terms agreed between the employer
and the employee. In some cases, a tribunal may have to be told what
was said in the allegedly pre-termination negotiations in order to
decide as a preliminary issue when termination took place.
However, once the termination date is decided, the tribunal cannot
take into account evidence of any negotiations before the termination
date in deciding the rest of the unfair dismissal claim including
whether there was a dismissal or constructive dismissal and whether
the dismissal was fair.23 The fact as well as the content of the
discussions must be kept off the record. Where there is a gap in open
correspondence, employment tribunals (ETs) should proceed on the
assumption that there were no communications relevant to their
decision on the unfair dismissal claim.24
If the tribunal believes anything said or done in the pre-termination
negotiations was improper, or connected with improper behaviour,
evidence of the protected conversation can be excluded only to the
extent that the tribunal thinks just.25 ACAS has produced a Code of
Practice on Settlement Agreements which sets out good practice.26 It
recommends face-to-face negotiations and that an employee is
allowed to bring a work colleague or trade union representative. The
Code gives guidance as to what might be considered improper, eg:

•

bullying and intimidation;

•

discrimination;

•

putting undue pressure on the other party, such as the employer not giving a reasonable
amount of time for consideration of an offer (normally ten calendar days) or telling the
employee that s/he will be dismissed if s/he refuses the offer, or the employee threatening
to damage the employer’s reputation (except where that would be legitimate
whistleblowing).

9.23

9.24

9.25

An example of a protected conversation would be where an
employer approaches an employee to say that things are not working
out and offers him/her six months’ pay if s/he agrees to leave. The
employee may turn down this offer, but if s/he is later dismissed and
brings an unfair dismissal claim, s/he cannot refer to the fact that this
offer had been made at an earlier stage. Nor, for that matter, can the
employer refer to it. It would also seem that the employee cannot
resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal on the basis that the
offer amounted to a breach of trust and confidence, unless there was
something ‘improper’ about the discussion.
Privilege on the ‘protected conversation’ cannot be waived and
the parties cannot agree that the conversation is put before the
tribunal.27
The ‘protected conversations’ rule only applies to ordinary unfair
dismissal claims and not to other claims such as for automatic unfair
dismissal or discrimination. Where an employee claims both unfair
dismissal and discrimination, it is therefore possible for the
protected conversation to be inadmissible for the unfair dismissal
claim but admissible for the discrimination claim.28

The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations (TUPE Regs) 2006 replaced the TUPE Regs
1981. Further amendments were made in January 2014.
The TUPE Regs protect employees on transfer of the business
in which they are employed.
Many situations are covered by the TUPE Regs 2006, and a
purposive approach should be adopted. The mechanism of the
transfer does not matter, provided there is a change of legal
person responsible for running the undertaking who acts as
employer.
The TUPE Regs 2006 have two different definitions of
transfer: 1) business transfers; and 2) service provision
changes. The latter category was explicitly added to the
regulations in 2006.
A ‘business transfer’ is a transfer of an economic entity (an
organised grouping of resources) which retains its identity
after transfer.
A ‘service provision change’ covers contracting out of services;
services reverting in-house; and the transfer of the service
between two successive contractors.
Protected employees are those who are employed
immediately before the transfer or who are dismissed in
advance because of the transfer, unless their dismissal was
for an economic, technical or organisational (ETO) reason
entailing changes in the workforce.
Where part of an undertaking is transferred, an employee
must have been assigned to that part, even if s/he has carried
out some duties for non-transferred parts.
It is automatically unfair to dismiss (or constructively dismiss)
an employee because of the transfer. It is not automatically
unfair if the dismissal is for an ETO reason entailing changes in

•

•

•

•
•
•

•

the workforce, in which case the ordinary test of fairness will
apply. The normal eligibility rules for claiming unfair dismissal
apply to both situations.
Where an employee is covered, rights, liabilities and
contractual terms transfer, eg wages owed, liability for
previous discriminatory acts and continuous service, but the
pension situation is complex. Where a term is linked to a
collective agreement, the incorporation of the collective
agreement for that term does not transfer if the new employer
is not a party to the collective bargaining process.
An agreement to change an employee’s terms and conditions
is void if it is because of the transfer. There are several
exceptions including variations for an ETO reason and changes
to collectively agreed terms taking effect more than one year
after the transfer if overall the terms are no less favourable.
There used to be special requirements and guidance for parts
of the public sector under the Cabinet Office Statement of
Practice and various Codes of Practice. These included
safeguards against development of a two-tier workforce. The
Statement of Practice has now been revised and the codes for
England and Wales have been abolished. However, the Welsh
Government has introduced a revised code.
For collective consultation on transfers, see paras 2.31–2.39.
It is arguable, but not tested in the higher courts, that workers
who are not employees have certain rights on transfer.
Discrimination law (with no minimum service requirement)
applies if the new employer refuses to take on workers or
treats them less favourably because of a protected
characteristic, eg race or disability.
Contracting out plays havoc with equal pay protection, since
contracted-out employees cannot usually compare their pay
with employees retained in-house (see para 5.20).

The Transfer of Undertakings Regulations
10.1

10.2

The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations (TUPE Regs) 20061 protect employees’ rights on
transfer of the business in which they are employed. Where there is a
transfer to which the TUPE Regs 2006 apply, the new employer
effectively stands in the shoes of the old employer, and employees
maintain continuous service for the purpose of all statutory rights.
The TUPE Regs 2006 also transfer the existing contractual terms and
conditions, as well as any outstanding liabilities and rights.2 An
employee, regardless of his/her length of service, can claim
automatic unfair dismissal if s/he is dismissed for asserting his/her
statutory rights under TUPE.3 In practice, however, the most
important protection is against unfair dismissal because of the
transfer, but employees must have at least two years’ service to make
such a claim.4 The TUPE Regs 2006 potentially apply to a transfer
from the UK to a business which is based outside the UK and even
outside the European Union (EU).5
The TUPE Regs were originally brought in to implement the
European Acquired Rights Directive, also known as the Business
Transfers Directive.6 This means they should be interpreted as far as
possible in line with decisions of the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) under the directive.7 The law is difficult
and constantly developing through decisions of the courts. The 2006
TUPE Regs made some changes from the earlier 1981 TUPE Regs
which they replaced, and in limited respects gave additional rights to
those in the directive. Further changes were made in January 2014.

There is a guide to the 2006 Regs produced by the then Department
for Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS). The guide, which is aimed
at employees, employers and representatives, was issued in 2006
and revised in 2014.8 It is helpful, but it has no legal status.
An employment tribunal (ET) has said that workers, and not just
employees, are also covered by the legislation as a result of the EU
directive.9 This is untested in the appeal courts. It raises difficult
questions as to which rights would be protected, as presumably
workers could not be given rights which ordinarily (aside from
TUPE) only employees have.

10.3

What is the method of transfer?
Much of the case-law has concerned when the TUPE Regs apply.
This means looking at what form of transfer, as well as what kind of
undertaking, is covered. A transfer may occur in many different
ways, although the most common means is by a straightforward sale
of a business, eg a restaurant chain under a brand name is sold by
one company to another with little visible change. It may also take
place by some other form of disposition such as granting a lease,
franchise, contract or gift, even if ownership of physical property has
not been transferred. Note that a share take-over is not in itself a
transfer, since ownership remains in the same legal person, ie the
company.10 However, a share sale could be accompanied or
followed by a transfer.11
A transfer may take place as a result of a series of transactions12
provided the business retains its identity, for example:

10.4

10.5

•

A factory is transferred back from a lessee to the owner, who then sells it on to another
company.13

•

An NHS Trust cleaning contract can transfer between two successive contractors (the
first contractor hands back the cleaning services at the end of its contract, which are
immediately transferred on to the second contractor).

There will be a particular date at which the transfer is considered to
take place and the employees’ contract rights transfer.14

What is a relevant transfer?
10.6

There are two forms of transfer under the TUPE Regs 2006:
1) The first type follows the original definition and case-law under the TUPE Regs 1981 and
derives from the EU directive. It is set out from para 10.7 below. Since 2006, this has
become known as a ‘business transfer’.
2) The second type of transfer, introduced in the TUPE Regs 2006, is referred to as a
‘service provision change’, and is set out from para 10.13 below.

The ‘business transfer’ definition can still be used for contracting out
by public authorities, as indeed it was prior to 2006, but the ‘service
provision change’ definition more naturally applies to that situation
and should have fewer legal problems in doing so.

Business transfers
Overview
10.7

Under TUPE Regs 2006 reg 3(1)(a), a transfer of an undertaking or
business occurs when there is a transfer of an economic entity which
retains its identity. An ‘economic entity’ means an organised
grouping of resources which has the objective of pursuing an
economic activity, whether that activity is central or ancillary.15 This
definition was re-worded in the TUPE Regs 2006 to reflect the caselaw which had already developed under the TUPE Regs 1981. There
are two stages which must be proved:16
1) that the undertaking was a stable economic entity prior to transfer; and
2) that the entity was transferred in a recognisable form.

The following are broad guidelines taken from the case-law as to
when TUPE will apply, but the particular facts of every case will be
important. It should also be remembered that most of the case-law on
the business transfers definition developed before the TUPE Regs
2006 came into force.
Stage 1: stable economic entity

10.8

10.9

The undertaking transferred must be a stable economic entity, but it
need not own any tangible assets. For example, it could be a labouronly contract such as the provision of cleaning services or
management of a shopping centre. It is not necessary for property to
be transferred by the transferee to the transferor.17 An organised
grouping of wage-earners who are specifically and permanently
assigned to a common task may amount to an economic entity.18
Relevant factors to consider are the entity’s workforce, management
staff, the way work is organised, its operating methods and where
appropriate, the operational resources available to it.19 A single
employee such as a cleaner can amount to an entity depending on the
facts, eg if the task to be performed is complex and sophisticated and
requires careful planning, specification and costings.20
Either the whole undertaking or a severable part of it must be
transferred, eg the transfer of one shop in a chain or contracting out a
cleaning or catering service. Non-commercial ventures are
covered,21 eg non-profit enterprises, voluntary organisations, free
advice centres, charities, NHS trusts22 and local education
services.23 It can include transfers between subsidiary companies
within a corporate group.24 An administrative reorganisation or
transfer of administrative functions between public administrative
authorities is not covered.25 The scope of this exclusion is not
entirely clear, but certain intra-governmental transfers may not be
covered by TUPE. The rights of public sector employees in these
instances are intended to be covered by other means, ie certain casespecific specialist legislation and various public sector Codes.
Stage 2: transferred in a recognisable form

10.10

The undertaking must be transferred in a recognisable form from one
employer to another. The overall test is whether the business in
question retains its identity, this being indicated in particular by the
continuation or resumption of its operation by the new employer.26
The greater the similarity between the business run before and after
the transfer, the more likely it is to satisfy this test. So, for example, a
chocolate factory which is sold to be converted into a nightclub,

would be a mere sale of assets and not of an undertaking. However,
the business need not be identical before and afterwards in the way
that it is run.
Case-law has suggested certain guidelines in deciding whether a
business has retained enough of its identity on transfer to be covered
by the ‘business transfers’ definition, although no single factor needs
to be present in every case and an overall assessment must be made.
In weighting factors, the type of undertaking must also be taken into
account.27 Employment tribunals must take a purposive approach, ie
remember that the purpose of the TUPE Regs 2006 and the directive
is to protect employees. Relevant factors28 will be:

10.11

•

the type of business or undertaking concerned; its size is irrelevant;

•

whether the business’s tangible assets, such as buildings and equipment, are transferred.
For example, catering is an activity essentially based on equipment; it is therefore important
whether the equipment is transferred.29 It is not essential that ownership (as opposed to
use) of assets is transferred.30 For example, if a hospital provides a kitchen and equipment
for its contract caterers, it is enough if both transferor and transferee use that same
equipment.31 If the business solely comprises services, transfer of assets will be
particularly unimportant;

•

the value of the intangible assets, eg goodwill, at the time of transfer and whether they are
transferred;

•

in a labour-intensive undertaking, whether or not the majority of employees are taken over
by the new employer;32 in an undertaking based significantly on tangible assets, whether
these have transferred;33 however, these are just factors – the fact that no assets are
transferred in an ‘asset-reliant’ undertaking, does not necessarily mean there is no TUPE
transfer.34 Indeed, it is not always possible or necessary to characterise a business
exclusively as ‘labour-intensive’ or ‘asset-reliant’;35

•

whether customers are transferred;

•

the degree of similarity between the activities carried on before and after the transfer;

•

the period, if any, during which those activities are suspended.

It does not matter if the new employer intends to integrate the
transferred undertaking into his/her own business, provided that
immediately after transfer the entity carries on the same activities as
before and so retains its identity.36 To say otherwise would make the

10.12

TUPE Regs 2006 largely ineffective as every business is likely to
wish to integrate any new business it has acquired. However, the
ECJ has stated, rather unintelligibly, that if there are organisational
changes post transfer, there must still be a ‘functional link of
interdependence and complementarity between the various elements
of production transferred’.37 It is also possible that an identifiable
economic entity is divided into two parts, both of which are
transferred. For example, a service providing refuse collection to a
whole borough may be divided geographically into the north and
south of the borough on transfer to two new contractors. Depending
on the facts, this does not necessarily prevent there being a transfer.38
Applying these guidelines tends to be difficult. For example, in
one case39 there was found to be a transfer of an undertaking to
provide medical services, although the method of provision would
change. The object of the undertaking remained the same, even
though the method of achieving that object changed as medical
science developed. By contrast, there was no transfer where an NHS
Trust hospital shop selling newspapers, magazines, confectionery
and flowers was changed on transfer to a major chain convenience
store with a much wider range of goods, longer opening hours and a
more commercial outlook. The ET considered that the identity of the
original shop had been replaced by an entirely new and different
concept.40 These examples are simply illustrative. It is essential to
give detailed examination to all the facts.

Contracting out – service provision changes
Applying the business transfers definition
10.13

The principle that the TUPE Regs can cover the contracting out of
services, often as a result of a compulsory competitive tendering
exercise in the public sector, was well-established prior to the 2006
amendments.41 Contracting out situations can therefore still be
covered under the original ‘business transfers’ definition. However,
the wording of the EU directive and the definition of business

transfers is not always adequate to cover the situations which arise.
Many problems arose under the 1981 TUPE Regs.
Applying the business transfers definition, the ECJ in Süzen said
that an ‘entity’ cannot be reduced to the activity it is carrying out. An
entity’s identity also emerges from other factors, eg workforce,
management structure, operating methods and resources. Therefore,
in a labour-intensive sector, where there is no transfer of significant
tangible or intangible assets, there may be no transfer unless the new
employer takes over a major part of the employees (in terms of
numbers and skills).42 However, following this decision, the Court of
Appeal said repeatedly that the importance of Süzen has been
overstated. It is still necessary to consider all the facts characterising
the transaction in question. The failure to appoint any of the former
employees does not point conclusively against a transfer. It is
relevant to consider why the employees were not taken on, eg
whether it was a deliberate attempt to avoid the TUPE Regs.43 The
intention of the parties and the fact that the transferee tendered on the
basis that TUPE applied would also be helpful.44
Under this definition, the undertaking must be a stable economic
entity and not one where the contracted service is itself of limited
duration, whoever is running it. For example, in one case the transfer
of part of a building contract for the construction of a canteen was
not covered by the TUPE Regs.45 It is different where complete
works projects are transferred.46
Examples where the original TUPE Regs applied include:

10.14

10.15

10.16
•

the contracting out of cleaning services by a bank which had previously employed one
cleaner to do the work;47

•

the transfer of hospital cleaning services from one contractor at the end of its contract to
another;48

•

a college’s termination of a catering contract in order to provide its own catering service;49

•

the contracting out to a college of prison education previously provided by the local
education authority;50

•

the transfer of a subsidy or grant by a public body, eg a local authority, from one advice
agency to another with similar aims.51

Service provision changes – the 2006 definition
Subject to specified exceptions, the former Labour government
wanted the TUPE Regs to apply to all contracting out situations,
without the legal complications and uncertainties set out above. In
2006, it therefore introduced an additional definition of a transfer.
Under TUPE Regs 2006 reg 3(1)(b), service provision changes are
explicitly covered.
Service provision changes cover any stage of the contracting out
or outsourcing process, ie the original grant of a contract,
reassignment of the contract to a different contractor, and taking the
service back in-house. The definition refers to a situation where
‘activities cease to be carried out’ by one person (whether the
original contracting body or a contractor) and ‘are carried out
instead’ by another person, eg a new contractor or reverting back to
the contracting body. It must also be the case that:

10.17

10.18

i)

immediately before the change, there is an organised grouping of employees, which has as
its principal purpose the carrying out of the activities concerned on behalf of the client (the
contracting body); and

ii)

the client intends that, following the service provision change, the activities will be carried
out by the transferee.52

10.19

The client must remain the same for the definition to apply.53 It is
possible for a sub-contractor to have the contracting body as its
client even though there is no contractual relationship between them
and the sub-contractor has only contracted with the contractor.54 The
important question will be whether the sub-contractor was carrying
out the activities for the client.
The advantage of the service provision change wording is that it
focuses on whether the activities remain the same, as opposed to
whether employees or assets transfer. Minor changes in the way
activities will be carried out by the transferee are within the
definition.55 Nor does it matter if the transferee carries out the
activities in a new or innovative way, eg by computerisation.56 The
test is ‘whether the activities carried on by the alleged transferee are
fundamentally or essentially the same as those carried out by the

10.20

10.21

alleged transferor’.57 For example, in one case where the activity
was the provision of accommodation for asylum-seekers, a
difference in location and the provision of a few extra ancillary
services was not enough to make it a different activity.58 However, in
another case, the provision of a hot cooked canteen service was not
the same ‘activity’ as selling sandwiches at a kiosk.59 Borderline
situations arise when public authorities transfer care from residential
homes to the community. It does not matter if the service is split in
two after the transfer, but if the service becomes completely
fragmented, there may be no service provision change. Depending on
the facts, this might apply for example where a service is split
amongst a large number of transferees and where the service users
are also split and randomly allocated amongst the transferees.
An ‘organised grouping of employees’ can comprise one
employee.60 However, the definition does not apply if there is no
identifiable employee or group of employees in the first place, eg the
client grants a contract for courier services, but prior to this, courier
services were carried out by various different couriers on an ad hoc
basis, as opposed to a permanent dedicated team. The employees
must have been deliberately organised for the purpose of carrying out
the activities for the particular client. TUPE may not apply if, for
example, call centre workers provide IT support services to callers
from a number of different schools without differentiating, but just
one of those schools decides to get its support services from a
different organisation. It is not enough that coincidentally a particular
group of employees happens to work on tasks benefiting a particular
client, eg because shifts coincide.61 Difficulties may also arise
where a group of employees spend part of their time carrying out the
relevant activities, but spend the rest of their time on other
activities.62
Contracts which the client genuinely intends to be for single
specific events or short-term tasks are excluded, eg organising a
conference or transporting schoolchildren to a temporary school
location while the usual school building is repaired. What amounts to
‘short-term’ depends on the overall context, eg a council usually

grants school bus driving contracts for five years but on this
occasion, a contract is granted for only one year. If there is a change
of contractor in the middle of a contract, the question is how long the
remainder of the contract is intended to last, not the overall time
taken for the project.63 Remember that the question is how long the
client intends the task to last at the time of granting the contract, not
how long it turns out to last in practice.64 Useful evidence of the
client’s intentions might be any time estimate contained in the
contract or complaints about delays during the performance of the
contract. It is not enough for the client to hope the task will be shortterm if it has no control over how long the task will take, eg a
council seeking a contractor to look after a person with learning
difficulties until the Court of Protection agrees to allow the
individual to be moved to a different town.65 The exclusion applies
either in the case of a single specific event or in the case of a task of
short-term duration. It is not necessary for both to apply.66 Contracts
wholly or mainly for the supply of goods as opposed to services are
also excluded,67 eg supplying sandwiches to a staff canteen to sell
on, as opposed to running the canteen, or providing computer
equipment as opposed to a trouble-shooting support service.

Public sector transfers
10.22

10.23

The Labour government in the early 2000s issued a number of codes
and similar documents to encourage fair treatment of transferred
workers in England and Wales. The codes were subsequently
withdrawn by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition
except in residual cases where they were incorporated in the terms
of existing contracts with external providers., Instead of the codes,
the Cabinet Office issued some voluntary good practice principles:
Principles of good employment practice: a statement of principles
that reflect good employment practice for government, contracting
authorities and suppliers.68
The Cabinet Office Statement of practice on staff transfers in the
public sector was revised in December 2013 together with its
important annex (revised October 2013): A fair deal for staff

10.24

10.25

10.26

pensions: staff transfer from central government.69 The guidance
applies directly to central government departments, agencies, the
NHS, maintained schools (except where they are covered for other
arrangements for local government) and any other parts of the public
sector under the control of government ministers where staff are
eligible to be members of a public service pension scheme.
On 2 July 2015, the Welsh Government introduced its own
Revised code of practice on workforce matters aimed at various
public bodies in Wales including councils, fire and rescue
authorities, NHS Trusts and the governing bodies of maintained
schools.70 Known informally as the ‘Two-tier Workforce Code’, this
is also aimed at preventing a two-tier workforce. In Scotland, the
Scottish Executive and Scottish TUC (Trades Union Congress)
agreed a Protocol in 2002 which was similar to the former codes.71
It is unclear whether this is still in usage.
The rest of this chapter sets out the general law under the TUPE
Regs 2006 and, if relevant, indicates what the remaining codes say
on the matter.
From time to time, legislation affecting transfers of employees
between different public sector bodies sets out statutory rules which
mirror those of TUPE. For example, in the past when local health
authority staff transferred to NHS Trusts. This is important where
TUPE might not otherwise apply eg because what has occurred is an
administrative reorganisation in the public sector (see para 10.9).

Which workers are protected?
10.27

The TUPE Regs 2006 protect employees who are employed by the
transferor and assigned to the organised grouping of resources or
employees immediately before,72 ie at the moment of,73 the transfer.
It is irrelevant if the employee is off work at the time of the transfer
due to sickness, holidays, maternity leave, etc.74 The employee will
usually transfer if s/he would have been required to work on the
transferring activities if s/he had not been absent. Some situations
may depend on the facts, eg absence due to a disciplinary suspension
where it is unclear if the worker will be returned to the same post; a

10.28

10.29

10.30

long-term sickness where the employee is unlikely to return at all; a
temporary lay-off because of no work or a gap between contracts.75
Employees dismissed because of the transfer and in advance of it,
are deemed to be employed immediately before the transfer, unless
the dismissal was for an economic, technical or organisational
(ETO) reason entailing changes in the workforce.76
An employee who is dismissed before the transfer, but not because
of the transfer, is not employed at the moment of transfer and has no
right to transfer, even if an appeal is pending – for example, an
employee is dismissed for theft. Nor is there any obligation on the
transferee to hear the appeal. The only exception would be in the
unusual situation where the employee’s contract states that his/her
employment is reinstated until the appeal is completed. However, if
the appeal is heard at a later stage and is successful, the original
dismissal effectively ‘disappears’, which means the employee was
employed after all immediately before the transfer and s/he has
TUPE rights against the transferee. Unless the contract says
otherwise, a successful appeal has this effect automatically and it is
not necessary for there to be an additional express decision to
reinstate.77
Where part of an undertaking is transferred, the TUPE Regs 2006
protect only those employees ‘assigned’ to that part.78 An employee
may be assigned to the transferred part even though s/he carried out
duties for other parts of the transferor’s business.79 An ET must look
at all the facts, such as time spent in each part, value given, and
allocation of costs and contractual terms. Although time is a big
factor, the whole picture is important. For example, an employee
who moves around as a trouble-shooter is not necessarily assigned to
the transferring part just because s/he happens to have spent the last
few months working there. Similarly, an employee who is employed
generally to manage contracts is not necessarily assigned to a
particular contract because that happens to be the most timeconsuming.80 Employers may try to shift employees around
immediately before a transfer so as to get rid of unpopular staff.
However, the ET will look at the reality of the situation, and if the

10.31

10.32

10.33

employee was assigned only temporarily to the part transferred, s/he
will not be part of the transfer.81
Where an employee apparently works in the whole of an
undertaking, which is subsequently split and transferred to two or
more different transferees, it can be difficult to identify to which part
(if any) s/he was assigned. If the employee worked in both parts,
his/her contractual rights and obligations will be split in proportion
amongst the transferees, but only if this does not worsen the
employee’s working conditions or damage his/her TUPE rights. It
also needs to be practically possible to separate the work. There is
no reason in theory why an employee cannot have two employers at
the same time, provided the work to be done for each is clearly
identifiable, for example there is a geographical split. If this does not
work, then the transferees will be responsible for any resulting
termination of the employment relationship, even if it is because the
employee refuses to transfer.82
It is hard to see how this principle will operate in practice.
Tribunals have to assess the practical implications of dividing an
employee’s contract amongst two or more employers. What seems
practical initially, may not be as time goes by. A full-time employee
may suddenly become a part-time employee in several different jobs.
How secure will part-time arrangements be in the longer term? What
happens if one employer changes hours of working so that the two
jobs can no longer be carried out at the same time? Equally unclear
is what type of claim an employee will have if a tribunal decides that
a split is not practical. Will it be a claim for automatic unfair
dismissal because the dismissal is because of the transfer, or will it
be an ordinary unfair dismissal claim?
Another difficulty arises with employees who did not directly
work on the transferring activities, but were in support operations
such as training, contract compliance and submitting tenders. Such
employees, even in an organisation which exclusively worked for the
one contracting authority, may not transfer if a tribunal believes that
technically they were not carrying out the activities which
transferred. This will usually come down to the definition of the

‘activities’ which are to be transferred and the work done by the
employee.83

Dismissal due to the transfer

It is automatically unfair for the transferor or transferee to dismiss an
employee if the sole or principal reason is the transfer.84 For
transfers and dismissals before 31 January 2014, it was also
automatic unfair dismissal if the reason was ‘connected with’ the
transfer. The difference between the reason being ‘the transfer’ itself,
and being ‘connected with’ the transfer, has not been clearly
explored by the case-law. It is still difficult to know how much
difference removing ‘connected with’ dismissals makes. The cases
referred to below were largely before this change to TUPE and
should be considered with that in mind.
Dismissals due to redundancy or reorganisation take place with
alarming regularity these days, and it can be hard to tell whether the
reason is a recent, current or pending transfer. It is important to
remember that it is the reason in the employer’s mind which counts:
the test is not simply whether the dismissal would have occurred had
there been no transfer.
It is possible for a dismissal for a personal reason also to be
because of the transfer,85 eg the transferee feels a particular
individual will be difficult to manage.
Dismissals at the time of the transfer are more likely to be because
of the transfer, but not necessarily. A dismissal for, say, stealing
money from the till, is unlikely to be because of the transfer (unless it
is a sham), even if it happens at roughly the same time. On the other
hand, the transfer can still be the reason even if the dismissal takes
place some time afterwards. There is no fixed time-period
afterwards within which a dismissal will be deemed because of the
transfer, and it can be years later if the evidence still suggests the
reason was the transfer.86
Similarly, a dismissal can be because of the transfer even if it is
carried out by the transferor well in advance. The old case-law on
‘connected with’ the transfer dismissals said this could include

10.39

dismissals at a very early stage where a transfer is contemplated but
no particular transfer or transferee is yet identified.87 For example,
where a public authority dismisses employees in order to make a
service more appealing to contractors, but before any bidding
process has started; or where administrators dismiss employees to
make a business more saleable, but before they advertise the
business as for sale, or before they have identified a prospective
purchaser.88 Having said that, a transfer would probably have to be
clearly envisaged and more than a remote possibility. There is the
extra uncertainty since 2014 as to whether such dismissals will be
covered under the more restricted wording.
It is not automatic unfair dismissal if the sole or principal reason
for dismissal is an ETO entailing changes in the workforce.89 This
should be considered in two stages:
1) First, is the reason economic, technical or organisational?
2) Second, does that reason entail changes in the workforce?

10.40

There is no statutory definition of the elements of ‘ETO’ but
economic reasons could relate to the profitability or market
performance of the business; technical reasons could relate to
equipment or production processes; and organisational reasons could
relate to management or organisational structure.
Any ‘economic’ reason must relate to the conduct of the business
itself and not just be to secure an enhanced sale price.90 A
contracting out situation can create ambiguities and it will depend on
the facts of the case. For example, where it is a condition of the
contract that a new contractor reduces the contract price by reducing
staff, what is the reason for the dismissals of the redundant staff? Is it
a cost-saving relating to the conduct of the business which would
have happened whether or not there was a transfer, or is it just a way
to reduce the cost of the contract to prospective bidders?91 Another
ambiguous situation is where a company is in severe financial
difficulties and administrators dismiss employees. It is important to
examine the facts carefully to see whether the ultimate objective of
the dismissals is to enable the business to continue, even if there is to

10.41

10.42

be a sale, as opposed to dismissing the employees merely to make
the business more attractive to purchasers.92
The main restriction on the ETO exception is that it must entail
‘changes in the workforce’. It is easy to forget this extra requirement
because of the common usage of the phrase ‘ETO’ to cover the entire
exception. However, it is very important – it means that the employer
cannot simply alter an employee’s contractual terms, eg to harmonise
with the existing workforce. The dismissal must be in order to
change the overall numbers of the workforce or change job
functions93 or change the place where employees are employed.94
For example, if an employee is dismissed for redundancy in order to
reduce the overall number of employees so as to save costs, that
would be dismissal for an economic reason which entails a ‘change
in the workforce’. If the change is to job function, it is not necessary
that the job functions of the whole workforce are changed; it is
enough if the dismissal is because of a change in the claimant’s
role.95 Such a change must be the objective of the employer’s plan,
not just a possible consequence. Nor is it enough that there is a
parallel change in workforce numbers or job functions at the same
time as the employee’s dismissal for, say, not agreeing a pay cut. The
employee must be dismissed for a reason which entails that change,96
eg the employee must be dismissed for redundancy or because
his/her own job function is changing.97 A change in job function must
be more than a minor change.98 If the dismissal is by the transferor,
the ETO reason must relate to the future conduct of the transferor’s
business, as opposed to changes in the transferee’s workforce.99
If the ETO exception does apply, it does not mean the dismissal is
fair. The ordinary principles to decide unfair dismissal claims will
apply, as the reason for dismissal is treated as a dismissal for
redundancy or some other substantial reason.100 To claim ordinary or
automatic unfair dismissal, the worker must be an employee with at
least two years’ service101 and have been dismissed in law. This
includes constructive dismissal, dismissal under reg 4(9) (see
below) and failure to renew a fixed-term contract.102

10.43

An employee may resign and claim constructive dismissal in the
usual way if his/her employer is in fundamental breach of contract.103
Even where the employer has not broken the contract, the employee
may claim s/he has been ‘dismissed’ if the transfer involves, or
would involve, a substantial change in working conditions to his/her
material detriment.104 This could include changes in terms and
conditions as well as physical working conditions; a change in
location allowed by the contract, but leading to a longer and more
stressful journey or childcare difficulties;105 a reduction in the
employee’s skills and responsibilities or a substantial reduction in
his/her bonus.106 Whether a change is a ‘substantial change’ depends
on the nature and degree of the change. An ET should consider the
impact from the employee’s point of view and decide whether the
employee’s position was a reasonable one to adopt.107 Even if the
employee can prove s/he has been ‘dismissed’ in these situations, the
dismissal will not necessarily be unfair, as explained above. Note
that notice pay cannot be claimed in respect of a ‘material detriment’
resignation.108

The effect of a transfer
Overview
10.44

Where the TUPE Regs 2006 apply, the new employer stands in the
shoes of the old employer for most purposes. The contractual terms
and conditions are transferred,109 as are all the transferor’s rights,
powers, duties and liabilities under or in connection with the
contract.110 This would include wages owed, keeping wages records
for the purposes of the national minimum wage,111 liability for
discrimination by the former employer112 and tortious liability,113 eg
for negligence leading to personal injury. If the transferor had an
employers’ liability insurance policy, the transferor’s right to an
indemnity under the policy for any such liability would also
transfer.114 It may also include liability for higher pay arising from an
equal pay comparison, even though the employee’s comparator has
not transferred and no equal pay case was brought prior to the

transfer.115 Alarmingly, where there is a contractual right to have pay
rates or other terms set by reference to a collective agreement, and
the transferee is not a participant in the collective bargaining process
for the relevant term, the contractual incorporation of the collective
agreement for that term does not transfer.116 For example, an
employee would continue to be entitled to his/her pay rate at the time
of the transfer, but not to any subsequent rises negotiated under the
collective agreement. The TUPE Regs 2006 probably also transfer
acquired continuous service for statutory employment rights.117
It is impossible to transfer an employee’s entitlement to participate
in the original employer’s profit-share scheme, so what transfers is
an entitlement to participate in a scheme of substantial
equivalence.118 On the other hand, if the employee had an express
mobility clause with the transferor, eg ‘The employee can be
transferred to work anywhere within the Trust’, this still covers the
geographical boundaries of the original Trust after the employee has
transferred to a new employer; it is not necessary to operate any
concept of ‘substantial equivalence’ even though the transferor’s
other locations are different from those of the new employer, which
makes the clause irrelevant.119
To ensure the transferee is well placed to honour obligations
towards the employees, the transferor must give the transferee
written ‘employee liability information’ at least 28 days before the
transfer.120 This comprises, in respect of each employee subject to
the transfer:

10.45

10.46

•

the employee’s identity and age;

•

the particulars required under ERA 1996 s1;121

•

information regarding any disciplinary action or grievance taken within the previous two
years in circumstances where the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
Code on Disciplinary and Grievance procedures applies;122

•

information regarding any court or tribunal case brought by the employee within the
previous two years or which is likely to be brought; and

•

applicable collective agreements.

10.47

10.48

The transferor and transferee must make sure they comply with data
protection law. It is permitted to disclose the employee liability
information under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Article 6(1)(c) because it is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation to which the controller is subject. However, data
protection principles must still be complied with, and only necessary
information disclosed. For a general overview of data protection
legislation, see chapter 1.
The precise legal position regarding transfer of pensions is
beyond the scope of this book. The law is complex and
developments in legislation and case-law should be watched. The
following is only a broad guide and further research is
recommended. Occupational pension schemes are excluded from the
TUPE Regs 2006 in so far as they cover old age, invalidity or
survivors’ benefits.123 Early retirement benefits paid on dismissal to
employees who have reached a certain age do not fall within this
category and should transfer.124 However, benefits payable after
normal retirement age, even if the pension first paid benefits before
normal retirement age, are considered old age benefits.125 Accrued
pension rights should be preserved,126 but there is probably no
entitlement to continued membership or contributions.127 Although,
with these exceptions, occupational pension schemes do not transfer,
the Pensions Act 2004 and the Transfer of Employment (Pension
Protection) Regulations 2005128 have introduced a minimum
occupational pension entitlement to transferred employees who had
such an entitlement with their employers before the transfer.
Unfortunately, there is no requirement that the post-transfer pension
is equivalent to the original scheme. Under the revised New Deal
agreement for transfers out of central government (see para 10.22),
those compulsorily transferred from public service to independent
providers will retain membership of their previous employer’s
pension scheme.129 This replaces the original New Deal approach
that the transferee must provide a broadly comparable private
pension scheme.

10.49

10.51

If the TUPE Regs 2006 apply to a particular employee, s/he
should usually claim for any transferred rights or unfair dismissal
against the transferee, even if s/he never started work for the new
employer and was dismissed in advance of the transfer, provided that
the dismissal was because of the transfer.130 However, if the
transferor’s reason for dismissal was not the transfer or if it was for
an ETO reason, the employee may have to sue the transferor. If in
doubt as to who to sue – eg due to uncertainty whether the TUPE
Regs 2006 apply or the transferor’s reason for dismissal or any other
complication – it is probably safest to claim in the alternative against
the old employer and the apparent transferee.
There are special rules where the transferor is subject to
insolvency proceedings. If the proceedings were instituted with a
view to the liquidation of the transferor’s assets and are under the
supervision of an insolvency practitioner, TUPE Regs 2006 regs 4
and 7 will not apply.131 This means that debts owed to employees
will not transfer to the transferee, nor will there be protection against
automatic unfair dismissal in respect of dismissal due to the transfer.
There has been ongoing uncertainty regarding what kind of
insolvency proceedings fit within this exclusion, but broadly
speaking it seems that it would include compulsory liquidation or
creditors’ voluntary liquidation, but not administration. This is
because an administrator by definition is not appointed with a view
to liquidating assets, even if that is what s/he ends up doing.132 In
situations where insolvency proceedings were opened not with a
view to liquidating the transferor’s assets (eg administration), the
National Insurance Fund will pay the transferor’s debts up to the
limits set under the statutory schemes and only the balance will be
due from the transferee.133 The idea is to help rescue failing
businesses. Note that rules regarding different kinds of insolvency
are a specialist area and this book can only give a loose guide based
on what appears to be the latest case-law.
An employee’s contract of employment and all the rights, powers,
duties and liabilities in connection with it, will not transfer if the
employee tells the transferor or the transferee that s/he objects to

10.52

10.53

becoming employed by the transferee. His/her employment will
simply terminate on the transfer, but s/he will not be treated as
having been dismissed and s/he will not be able to claim unfair
dismissal or redundancy pay.134 If the transferor allows the employee
to stay on, the employee may have to negotiate new terms and
conditions, as his/her old contract of employment will probably no
longer apply.135
An employee, who is employed in the undertaking to be
transferred, cannot be forced to stay with the transferor because the
TUPE Regs 2006 will automatically apply. For example, the
transferor cannot prevent employees against their will from
transferring by insisting they remain with the transferor and
redeploying them at the moment of transfer under contractual
mobility clauses.136 It sometimes happens that employees employed
in the business to be transferred choose to remain with their original
employer, but to work for the transferee on secondment. In such
situations, despite what everyone agrees and believes, it is very
likely that the employee’s employment will have automatically
transferred to the transferee at the date of transfer of the business.137
If the employee then returns to work for the transferor at the end of
the secondment period, this will probably be deemed a new contract
of employment between the employee and the transferor, which
means the employee will lose his/her continuous service (unless that
is preserved by ‘custom or arrangement’ – see para 6.22).
A difficulty can arise regarding the transfer of migrant workers
who require sponsorship under the points-based immigration system.
An employer needs to be licensed to sponsor migrant workers. If the
transferor was licensed but the transferee is not, presumably the
latter must apply for a licence and, if it chooses not to, its employees
who are sponsored migrants will have a limited amount of time to
find a new sponsor. Quite apart from this, transferees must check the
documents of all their employees within 60 days of the transfer to
check no illegal workers have transferred contrary to the rules in the
Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (see paras 14.83–
14.84).138 Immigration rules frequently change, and it is advisable to

check the latest position. These are some pointers, but immigration
rules are not within the scope of this book.

Changing the terms and conditions
Generally
10.54

10.55

The TUPE Regs 2006 preserve contractual terms and conditions and
prohibit changes due to the transfer. An employer’s attempt to impose
new terms and conditions, even if s/he has secured the employee’s
agreement (expressly or by affirmation) will be ineffective if the sole
or principal reason for the change is the transfer.139 So, for example,
an employee retained by the new employer, ostensibly on changed
terms and conditions, can subsequently insist on his/her pre-transfer
terms still applying.140 The position has become less clear-cut where
it is the new employer (the transferee) who later wants to back out of
an agreement it has made with the transferring employee. It is
probable that, unlike an employee, the transferee cannot later rely on
the TUPE Regs 2006 to contend that a variation agreed on a transfer
is void. If this is right, there is nothing to stop an employee agreeing
additional rights with the transferee and later choosing whether to
rely on his/her old term or the agreed new term141
A variation to the contract can be agreed if the reason is not the
transfer. It depends on the facts whether the reason for changing
terms and conditions is the transfer. It is more likely to be the reason
if the purpose of the change is to bring terms and conditions into line
with those of existing staff of the transferor, or if the change occurs at
the time of the transfer as opposed to much later.142 On the other
hand, if the business was already in financial trouble and the
transferor was trying to save money by cutting pay prior to the
transfer, the fact that the transferee cuts salaries for the same reason
suggests the contract change is not because of the transfer.143 The
issues are similar to those arising for automatic unfair dismissals
(see above) and there is the same change in wording from January
2014 so that changes for reasons ‘connected with’ the transfer are no
longer explicitly made void. The test of whether the reason for the

10.56

change in terms and conditions is the transfer, is not simply whether
it would have happened if there had been no transfer. The proper test
is to look at the reason the transferor acted as it did.144
Even if the agreed variation to terms and conditions is because of
the transfer, there are some exceptions where it is permitted, for
example if the contract allows such a variation.145 An agreed
variation is also allowed if it is for an ETO reason entailing changes
in the workforce.146 The ETO exception is the same as that for
transfer-related automatic unfair dismissal (see above). A change in
the workforce can be a change in numbers, job function or
location.147 It is also possible to agree a variation to a term
incorporated from a collective agreement, provided the variation
takes place more than one year after the transfer and the rights and
obligations in the employee’s contract are overall no less favourable
than before.148 Finally, there is an exception for insolvency
situations, where the business is transferred as a going concern. The
transferor, transferee or insolvency practitioner is permitted to make
a written agreement with trade union or employee representatives to
change terms and conditions, even if the reason for the variation is
the transfer and not an ETO reason, provided the variation is
designed to safeguard employment opportunities by ensuring the
survival of the undertaking.149
New employees

10.57

One practical problem is that new employees get taken on with less
favourable terms and conditions than those of transferred staff,
making the latter less desirable to retain in the long term. UNISON
and other unions lobbied hard for legislation to help prevent such a
two-tier system after contracting out of the public sector. As a result,
where the Code of Practice on workforce matters in public sector
service contracts (‘Two-tier Workforce Code’) applies in Wales or
(if still in existence) the Scottish Protocol applies,150 it requires the
service provider to consult representatives of the recognised trade
union on the terms and conditions to be offered to new recruits. If
there is no recognised trade union, consultation will be with elected

10.58

representatives. The consultation should involve a genuine dialogue.
The intention is that contractors and trade unions should be able to
agree on a particular package of terms and conditions to be offered
to new joiners, in keeping with the terms of the Protocol. In the
Welsh Code, ‘new joiners’ are defined as including existing
employees of the transferee as well as newly taken on staff.
The Protocol and Code say that new employees must be employed
on fair and reasonable terms and conditions which are no less
favourable overall (apart from pensions) than those of transferred
employees. Unfortunately, this does mean that they can have different
terms and conditions, some being more favourable and some being
less favourable. New joiners must also be offered the same or
broadly comparable pension arrangements as transferred employees.
Details are at paras 9.5–9.6 of the Protocol. In England, similar
principles used to be covered by Local Authority and Public Sector
‘Two-tier Workforce’ Codes, but as explained above, these have
now been withdrawn.

Collective consultation
10.59

10.60

There are special rules under TUPE Regs 2006 regs 13–16 whereby
the employer of any affected employees must inform and consult
about the transfer with either the trade union or, if there is none, with
correctly elected employee representatives. If the employer fails to
do so, the trade union or employee representative (as applicable) can
bring a claim for compensation on behalf of the employees. A
maximum of 13 weeks’ compensation for each employee can be
awarded. The transferor and transferee are jointly and severally
liable for any compensation due to failure collectively to consult the
trade union or employee representatives about the transfer.151
Individual employees can only bring a claim for failure to inform
or consult if there is no union or elected employee representative. As
with all claims, it is important when writing the tribunal claim form
to be clear if a claim for failure to inform and consult under regs 13
and 15 is being made, as distinct from other claims which may also

be itemised on the form, eg unfair dismissal because of the transfer.

Chapter 11: Key points
Pregnancy-related dismissals and discrimination
•

•

•

•

Dismissals for reasons connected with pregnancy or maternity
leave are automatically unfair. Other detrimental treatment is
also unlawful. There is no minimum qualifying service.
Dismissal or other discrimination due to pregnancy and related
reasons such as pregnancy-related sickness is unlawful
pregnancy discrimination if it occurs during pregnancy or
maternity leave.
In limited circumstances, eg pregnancy-related sickness
occurring after maternity leave, a comparison with a man in
equivalent circumstances may be necessary to prove sex
discrimination.
A woman cannot claim full pay while on maternity leave purely
because her absence is pregnancy-related.

General guide to useful evidence
•

•

Evidence proving that the detriment or dismissal was for
pregnancy or a related reason as opposed to the reason put
forward by the employer.
If comparison with a man is necessary, evidence showing how
a man would have been treated in comparable circumstances,
eg if he required sick leave.

Maternity rights and family related leave
•

Pregnant women are entitled to risk assessments and paid
time off if specified risks exist. They are also entitled to
reasonable time off for antenatal care. Their partner is entitled
to unpaid time off on two occasions to accompany them.

•

•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•
•

•

•

•

Employees adopting children are allowed equivalent time off
for meetings in advance of the adoption.
Every woman who is an employee is entitled to 26 weeks’
ordinary maternity leave (OML) followed by 26 weeks’
additional maternity leave (AML).
There are two weeks’ compulsory maternity leave (CML)
following childbirth.
The correct notifications must be given before starting leave
and if wanting to come back early.
Maternity leave is automatically triggered by any pregnancyrelated absence in the last four weeks before the expected
week of childbirth (EWC).
There are similar rights for adoption leave and new rights for
parental order parents in surrogacy arrangements.
During statutory maternity leave (SML), women are entitled to
their normal terms and conditions other than pay.
There is a right to two weeks’ ordinary paternity leave (OPL).
The mother and her partner or the father can choose to share
maternity leave and pay after the first two weeks’ compulsory
leave for the mother. This is called ‘shared parental leave’
(SPL).
There is a new right to two weeks’ parental bereavement
leave.
Statutory maternity, paternity, adoption, shared parental, and
parental bereavement leave pay are available for those who
qualify.
Employees with one year’s service are entitled to a total of 18
weeks’ unpaid parental leave to take care of children up to 18.
This is not the same thing as ‘shared parental leave’ (above).
Employees are entitled to reasonable unpaid time off as
dependant leave to make arrangements when certain
emergencies arise with children or other dependants.
It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee and
unlawful to subject him/her to a detriment for reasons

connected with maternity, parental, dependant or parental
bereavement leave (see paras 6.70–6.73). It is also automatic
unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee for asserting a
statutory right, eg the right to time off for antenatal care.

Part-time and flexible working
•

•

•
•
•

•

Employees with 26 weeks’ continuous service can formally
request flexible working under the Flexible Working
Regulations 2014, ie a change in their hours or to work from
home. Employers can refuse to give permission. As long as
the correct procedure is followed, refusal can be challenged
only by using other legal rights eg discrimination law if it
applies.
Refusal to permit a woman to work part-time or arrive or leave
at certain hours may be unlawful indirect sex discrimination
under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010.
The main issue on part-time working will usually be whether
the employer can justify insisting on full-time working.
It may also be indirect sex discrimination unjustifiably to treat
part-time workers less well than full-timers.
Where part-timers are given less favourable contractual terms
and conditions, including pay rates, EqA 2010 Part 5 Chapter
3 (‘equality of terms’) applies.
Under the Part-time Workers Regulations 2000, a part-timer
(male or female) should not be treated less favourably than a
comparable full-timer because she is a part-timer (on a pro
rata basis), unless an employer can justify doing so.

General guide to useful evidence
•
•

Find out the employer’s justification.
Evidence to show why part-time working in the job will be
satisfactory or even beneficial.
To claim sex discrimination:

•

•

Evidence generally and within the appropriate pool showing
that women are at a particular disadvantage compared with
men in respect of the particular hours or flexibility requirement.
Evidence showing that the particular worker has difficulty
working full-time or the particular hours or shifts required.
To claim under the Part-time Workers Regulations 2000:

•

Evidence regarding the chosen comparator.

Pregnancy-related dismissals and discrimination
11.1

In September 2003, the former Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC) launched a formal investigation into pregnancy
discrimination, including discrimination while on maternity leave
and on return to work. In June 2005, it published its final report:
Greater expectations: Final report of the EOC’s investigation into
discrimination against new and expectant mothers in the
workplace. The report said the data it had collected showed that the
level of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was ‘appalling’.
The EOC was stunned at the number of women who said they had
been dismissed, demoted, denied training or promotion, or bullied
into quitting, just because of their pregnancy. It estimated that each
year, almost half of the 440,000 pregnant women in Great Britain
experienced some form of disadvantage at work as a result, and
30,000 were forced out of their jobs. In March 2016, the Equality
and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and the then Department for
Business, Innovation & Skills (BIS) published Pregnancy and
maternity-related discrimination and disadvantage: experience of
employers and Pregnancy and maternity-related discrimination
and disadvantage: experience of mothers.1 One in five mothers
surveyed said they had experienced harassment or negative
comments related to pregnancy or flexible working from their
employer and/or colleagues; ten per cent of mothers said their
employer discouraged them from attending antenatal appointments;
and 11 per cent of mothers believed they had been dismissed, made

11.2

11.3

11.4

11.5

redundant or forced to leave because of pregnancy.2 Following this,
the House of Commons Women and Equalities Select Committee
published a report into pregnancy and maternity discrimination at
work.3 It expressed concern that inaction would lead to the same
problems in five to ten years’ time, and made a number of
recommendations. For evidence to prove pregnancy discrimination,
see para 16.37.
Under Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s99 and Maternity and
Parental Leave etc Regulations (MPL Regs) 19994 reg 20, it is
automatically unfair to dismiss a female employee for a number of
reasons connected with her pregnancy, maternity or maternity leave
(see paras 6.70–6.72). There is no minimum service requirement to
claim unfair dismissal for these reasons. A woman is entitled to
written reasons if she is dismissed while pregnant or on maternity
leave, again regardless of her length of service.5
Women may also claim that dismissal in such circumstances is
unlawful pregnancy or maternity discrimination contrary to the
Equality Act (EqA) 2010.6 Where possible, women should usually
claim under both statutes, since a successful discrimination claim
would lead to additional compensation. Discrimination in pay and
contract terms would be covered by EqA 2010 Part 5 Chapter 3.
Unfavourable treatment of a woman due to pregnancy or maternity
is also prohibited by European Union (EU) law. It is covered by the
general provisions of Article 157 (formerly 141) and the Recast
Directive7 as well as the Pregnant Workers Directive.8 For the
continued applicability of EU law post-Brexit, see chapter 3.
Under EqA 2010 s18, it is unlawful to treat a woman unfavourably
because of her pregnancy or because of an illness suffered by her as
a result of her pregnancy. This applies where the unfavourable
treatment, or the decision to carry out the unfavourable treatment, is
made in the woman’s ‘protected period’. The protected period
begins with her pregnancy and ends at the end of her statutory
maternity leave (SML) period. Where a woman has the right to
ordinary maternity leave (OML) and additional maternity leave
(AML), this means at the end of the AML period or when she returns

11.6

11.7

to work if sooner. If she does not have the right to OML and AML,
the protected period is two weeks from the end of pregnancy, ie the
compulsory maternity leave (CML) period. It is well-established in
the case-law that no comparison is required either with how a man
would be treated in an equivalent situation or with how a nonpregnant woman would be treated. It need only be shown that the
discrimination is because of the woman’s pregnancy. Although in
many situations – for instance, a failed promotion – it is useful as a
matter of evidence to compare the way a pregnant woman is treated
with the treatment of a non-pregnant comparator, such a comparison
does not always work.
There is no justifiability defence available to the employer for
pregnancy-related discrimination. The Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU) has consistently taken a very firm line on
this principle, even when the results seem unfair to the employer. In
the leading case of Webb,9 Mrs Webb was taken on for a permanent
job, but initially to cover another worker’s maternity leave. She was
dismissed when the employer discovered she could not cover the
leave, due to her own maternity leave. Nevertheless, this was
unlawful discrimination. In another case,10 a temporary nurse in a
heart clinic applied for a permanent post which was to start
immediately. She was eight weeks pregnant at the time. Under
German law, pregnant women could not work in an operating theatre
for health and safety reasons. Her application was therefore rejected.
The CJEU said this was unlawful sex discrimination.
It is the same if the woman was only employed on a short fixedterm contract,11 although this may mean she does not get much
compensation. Mrs Brandt-Nielsen was employed for a six-month
fixed-term contract starting 1 July 1995. In August 1995 she told her
employer that she was pregnant with a due date of early November.
She was dismissed on the grounds that she had not said she was
pregnant when she was recruited. The CJEU said that dismissal of a
worker on account of pregnancy was direct sex discrimination
whatever the nature and extent of the economic loss incurred by her
employer as a result of her pregnancy. This was so even though she

11.8

11.9

11.10

had knowingly failed to inform her employer of her pregnancy on
recruitment and even though she was unable to work a substantial
part of the term of a fixed-term contract.12 As an employee’s
pregnancy is not a factor which an employer can lawfully be
influenced by, the woman is not obliged to tell her employer that she
is pregnant.13
It is pregnancy discrimination for a sick pay scheme to exclude
pregnancy-related illness.14 A woman absent due to a pregnancyrelated illness must be paid the same sick pay as anyone else, but she
is not entitled to full pay just because she is pregnant, if there is no
such entitlement under her contract.15
As stated above, it is pregnancy discrimination (without needing a
male comparison) to treat a woman unfavourably due to her
pregnancy at any time through her protected period, or to make a
decision during the period, which is carried out afterwards.
However, where the unfavourable treatment is decided upon and
occurs after the end of her maternity leave, the claim is for sex
discrimination and a comparison with a man in a similar position is
still necessary, eg where a woman is dismissed due to a pregnancyrelated illness occurring after her maternity leave period.16 This
applies even if the illness, eg post-natal depression, first arose
during maternity leave.17 Where a woman is absent through sickness
after her maternity leave, she is entitled to be treated no worse than a
man would be treated if sick for a similar period disregarding the
earlier period of absence during pregnancy and maternity leave.18 If
the woman is suffering from post-natal depression, depending on its
severity and how long it lasts, she could alternatively consider a
disability discrimination claim.19
It is also unlawful to treat a woman unfavourably because she is
on SML or is seeking to take up her rights to SML or has done so.20
For more detail regarding discrimination during maternity leave, see
paras 11.63–11.65. A woman who is dismissed because her
maternity locum is more efficient may claim pregnancy
discrimination because, had she not been absent, the unfavourable
comparison would not have arisen.21

11.11

11.12

Dismissal of a female worker because she is undergoing an
advanced stage of IVF treatment, ie between the follicular puncture
and the immediate transfer of the fertilised ova into the uterus,
constituted direct sex discrimination under the former Equal
Treatment Directive (now consolidated into the Recast Directive)
and presumably also under the EqA 2010, without needing to make
any comparisons with how a man would be treated. It will not be
‘pregnancy discrimination’ until after the transfer of the egg, but
either way, the woman will be legally protected.22 Dismissal of a
woman at very early stages of IVF treatment, before she is
considered pregnant, is potentially sex discrimination (as opposed to
pregnancy discrimination). The difficulty then is that a comparison is
required with how a man would be treated in an ‘equivalent’
situation, eg a man needing an equivalent amount of time off.23
Note that men cannot claim sex discrimination if an employer
chooses to give special treatment to women in connection with
pregnancy or childbirth.24 However, this only applies if the special
treatment goes no further than is reasonably necessary to compensate
the woman for any disadvantage occasioned by her being pregnant or
on maternity leave.25 It was not possible under the Sex
Discrimination Act (SDA) 1975 for a man to claim pregnancy
discrimination if he was treated less favourably because of his
partner’s pregnancy.26 It is untested whether such a claim would be
possible under the EqA 2010, if not as pregnancy discrimination
under section 18, perhaps as associative sex or pregnancy
discrimination under section 13.

Maternity leave
Introduction
11.13

The rules regarding maternity leave have always been complex. The
law is set out in the ERA 1996 and the MPL Regs 1999.27 Although
the rules are now simpler than in the past, the law is still complex
and uncertain in some areas. The following is therefore only a
general introduction.

11.14

11.15

Historically, a woman risked losing all her rights if she failed to
take the correct steps before and after maternity leave. Although
there are more safeguards now, even under the current law, there are
important rules to comply with. If a woman is refused maternity
leave or not allowed to return for a reason related to pregnancy or
maternity leave,28 she may be able to claim unlawful detriment or
unfair dismissal under the ERA 1996 as well as sex or pregnancy or
maternity discrimination under the EqA 2010.29 If the woman is
dismissed for an unconnected reason, she can claim ordinary unfair
dismissal, provided she has at least two years’ service. There are
advantages in claiming jointly under the ERA 1996 and the EqA
2010, since the EqA 2010 can attract additional compensation. There
are other possible claims which may apply, eg it would be automatic
unfair dismissal to dismiss the woman for asserting a statutory right
such as the right to maternity leave or to time off for antenatal care.30
Whereas EqA 2010 s18 covers pregnancy discrimination against
women who are not employees, the position is unclear on
discrimination in connection with maternity leave. This is because
the prohibition on maternity leave discrimination is linked to being
on SML, which is itself only available to employees. Arguably there
is protection for the first two weeks after birth, but even if this is
correct, it is inadequate. Female workers (but not employees)
discriminated against because of maternity leave can claim sex
discrimination under EqA 2010 s13 and argue that, by virtue of EU
law, no comparison with a man should be required. Whether this will
succeed remains to be tested.
All women who are employees, regardless of length of service,
are entitled to 12 months’ SML, comprising 26 weeks’ OML and a
further 26 weeks’ AML. The entitlement depends on having made the
correct notifications. There is also a short period of two weeks’
CML.

Ordinary maternity leave
Overview

The first 26 weeks of SML are OML.31 There is a compulsory leave
(CML) period of two weeks after childbirth (and any period where
there is a relevant statutory prohibition on the woman working).32
OML starts on a date notified by the woman, which she can
subsequently vary. It can start earlier, eg if childbirth occurs, or on
the first day after the start of the fourth week before the expected
week of childbirth (EWC) when she is absent from work wholly or
partly because of pregnancy.33 This means that maternity leave could
start automatically, even though the woman does not want it to, just
because she is off work through pregnancy-related sickness for an
isolated day. However, her employer may be prepared to make an
agreement that her leave is not automatically triggered in this way.

11.16

11.17

The required notifications
The woman must give notice no later than the end of the fifteenth
week before her EWC (or if that is not reasonably practicable, as
soon as reasonably practicable afterwards) of:

11.18

•

her pregnancy;

•

the EWC;

•

(in writing if her employer so requests) the date she intends her OML to start;34 this cannot
be earlier than the eleventh week before the EWC.

11.19

11.20

The woman can change her mind about the date she wants her leave
to start, as long as she gives her employer at least 28 days’ notice
before the date varied or the new date (whichever is earlier), or if
that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably
practicable.35
Where the woman’s OML is automatically triggered by a
pregnancy-related absence in the last four weeks before the EWC
(see above), she must notify the employer (in writing if requested) as
soon as reasonably practicable that she is absent due to pregnancy
and the date her absence began for that reason. Similarly, if her leave
is triggered by giving birth, she must notify her employer (in writing
if requested) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the birth that

11.21

11.22

she has given birth and the date on which it occurred. Otherwise she
will lose her right to OML.36
If requested by her employer, the woman must produce a
certificate from a registered medical practitioner or midwife stating
the EWC.37 The EWC means the week, beginning with midnight
between Saturday and Sunday, in which it is expected that childbirth
will occur.38
If a woman has a premature birth, her maternity leave will start on
the day after the baby is born (regardless of any date she has
formally noted for maternity leave).39 The woman is entitled to her
full leave if she has given birth to a live baby, even if the baby does
not survive very long, or if she has a stillbirth after 24 weeks of
pregnancy.40

Additional maternity leave
Overview
11.23

The right to AML used to be available only to women who had been
employed for at least 26 weeks at the start of the fourteenth week
before the EWC. However, women no longer need any qualifying
service.41 AML starts on the day after the expiry of OML and
continues for 26 weeks.42
The required notifications

11.24

The woman must make the same notifications as for OML. She need
not state explicitly that she will be taking AML as it is presumed that
she will do so.

Returning from ordinary or additional maternity leave
The return date
11.25

Within 28 days of receiving the woman’s notification of when she
intends to take her leave (see paras 11.18–11.19), the employer must
notify her of the date when her maternity leave period will end.43 If
the woman has notified the employer of a variation in the start date,

11.26

11.27

11.28

the employer must notify her within 28 days of the start of her OML
of when the maternity leave period will end.44
It is then assumed that the woman will return at the end of her 12
months’ leave. If she wants to return early, she must give at least
eight weeks’ notice. Otherwise her employer can postpone her return
for up to eight weeks (though not beyond the end of the relevant
maternity leave period).45 The woman can change her mind about her
return date as long as she gives at least eight weeks’ notice before
her original date or her new date, whichever is earlier.46 If a woman
is unable to return after her leave due to sickness, the normal sickleave procedures at her workplace will apply. If the woman is
dismissed during her SML, but before its expiry, the leave period
ends at the time of the dismissal.
Paras 11.58–11.68 below set out the woman’s rights during her
maternity leave and the nature of the job to which she is entitled to
return.
If the woman wants to share her maternity leave with her partner,
she must bring her normal SML to an end and follow the various
notification requirements for shared parental leave (SPL), provided
she is eligible. This is set out in paras 11.39–11.47.

Adoption leave
11.29

11.30

ERA 1996 ss75A and 75B give employees a right to adoption leave
which is very similar to the right to maternity leave. The law is set
out in the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations (PAL Regs)
2002.47 The following is only a very brief summary and advisers
need to check the regulations. Note that the rules have some slight
differences for overseas adoptions. The intended parent of a child
born via a surrogacy arrangement who has a parental order, or who
has applied or intends to apply for one, (a ‘parental order parent’) is
entitled to take ordinary adoption leave (OAL).48
Since 5 April 2015, it has no longer been necessary for employees
to have any minimum service to be entitled to adoption leave.49
Either adoptive parent can take the leave but not both. However, the

11.31

11.32

11.33

11.34

other parent may be able to take paternity leave, or both could take
SPL.50
No later than seven days after the date the employee is notified of
having been matched with the child, the employee must give the
employer notice of the date when the child is expected to be placed
with him/her and the date when s/he wishes the leave to begin. The
employee can give notice to vary the date once given.51 Within 28
days of this notification, the employer must write to the employee
setting out the date s/he is due to return.52 If the employer requests,
the employee must also provide the employer with documents issued
by the adoption agency confirming certain details.53
OAL starts either when the child is placed with the employee or
on a date up to two weeks earlier which the employee has notified to
the employer.54 The employee will usually be entitled to 26 weeks of
OAL and a further 26 consecutive weeks of additional adoption
leave (AAL).55 If the employee wishes to return earlier, s/he must
give at least eight weeks’ notice.56 If the placement is disrupted
during adoption leave, eg because it will not take place or because
the child dies, the employee will be entitled to eight weeks’ leave
from the disruption or death, although not beyond the end of the AAL
period.57
An employee’s rights during OAL and AAL and on return are
virtually identical to those for OML and AML (see paras 11.58–
11.67).58
Statutory adoption pay (SAP) is available for employees who
meet the necessary criteria and who have worked for the employer
for at least 26 weeks by the week they were matched with the
child.59 It is payable during adoption leave for a maximum of 39
weeks at 90 per cent of weekly pay, subject to a maximum of
£151.97 after the first six weeks.60

Paternity leave
11.35

The right to ordinary paternity leave (OPL) is set out in ERA 1996
ss80A–80E and the PAL Regs 2002.61 As with the rights to maternity

11.36

11.37

11.38

and adoption leaves, the rules are detailed and the following is only
a summary. An employee who is the father of the child or married to
or the partner of the child’s mother is entitled to paternity leave if he
has responsibility for the child’s upbringing.62 Same-sex partners are
included.63 An employee is also entitled to take paternity leave
where he is married to or the partner of the child’s adopter.64 An
employee taking paternity leave must have been continuously
employed for at least 26 weeks ending with the week immediately
preceding the fourteenth week before the EWC.65 There is a right to
paternity leave even if the child has died or was stillborn after 24
weeks of pregnancy.
The employee can take either one week’s leave or two
consecutive weeks, but not two separate weeks and not individual
days.66 The leave must be taken within 56 days of the child’s birth or,
if the child is born prematurely, of the EWC.67 In or before the
fifteenth week before the EWC, the employee must give the employer
notice of his intention to take paternity leave, specifying the EWC,
the length of leave he wishes to take and the start date.68 He can vary
the date by giving 28 days’ notification.69 If it is not reasonably
practicable to give these notifications, the employee must give them
as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards.
The employee is entitled to return to the job in which he was
employed previously. If he has added the paternity leave onto other
statutory absences, eg AAL or parental leave of more than four
weeks, then if it is not reasonably practicable to let him return to the
same job, he is entitled to return to another job which is suitable and
appropriate for him.70 During OPL, the employee is entitled to the
benefit of all his terms and conditions of employment as if he had not
been absent, apart from wages or salary.71 Employees who meet the
necessary criteria can claim statutory paternity pay at 90 per cent of
weekly pay or £151.97,72 whichever is less.
An employee is not entitled to take OPL if he has taken any SPL in
respect of the child.73 Additional paternity leave (APL) no longer
exists as it has been replaced by SPL (see below).

Shared parental leave
11.39

11.40

The right to SPL arises where a child’s EWC or the adoption
placement was on or after 5 April 2015.74 SPL applies where a birth
mother wishes to share her maternity leave and pay with ‘P’, the
father of the child or husband or civil or other partner of the mother.
The general idea is that a mother who is eligible for SML and
statutory maternity pay (SMP) can cut short her leave and pay, and
share the balance after the child’s birth with P. The mother must still
take at least two weeks CML after birth. The mother and P can
decide to take the leave at the same time or take it in turns to be off
work. SPL replaces the old system of APL,75 although OPL still
exists (see para 11.35). It is possible that only one of the mother and
P is eligible for SPL. The rules for SPL are painfully detailed and
complicated and can only be summarised here. There are similar
rights for employees who adopt children and for intended parents of
surrogate children. There are two useful and clear guides, although
they have no formal legal status: Employers’ technical guide to
shared parental leave and pay (December 2014, updated April
2020) published by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial
Strategy (BEIS);76 and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service’s (ACAS’s) Shared parental leave: a good practice guide
for employers and employees.77 There are also some template forms
on the ACAS website which are intended to cover all the information
which must be provided at each stage.
Employees are eligible for SPL if they have been continuously
employed for at least 26 weeks by the end of the fifteenth week
before the EWC or, if the child is born earlier, would otherwise have
reached that number of weeks.78 They must also remain employed by
that employer until the week before they take any period of SPL. A
mother is eligible for SPL to care for a child if she has the main
responsibility for the child’s care at the date of birth (apart from P’s
responsibility), she is entitled to SML, and she has curtailed her right
to SML or has in practice returned to work before the end of her
SML. If the mother wants to return to work early, she needs to give at
least eight weeks’ notice in accordance with the usual rules for

11.41

11.42

returning from maternity leave.79 Alternatively, she can cut short her
entitlement to SML by serving a ‘maternity leave curtailment
notice’.80 The effect of this is to make the balance of SML available
for SPL. The mother must also give the correct notices and provide
evidence as set out below. In addition, P must satisfy the earnings
and employment test81 and, at the date of birth, must have the main
responsibility for the care of the child (apart from the mother’s
responsibility).82 P’s eligibility for SPL has mirror image
requirements except that, whereas the mother must be entitled to
SML for her own eligibility for SPL, it is sufficient for P’s eligibility
if the mother was entitled to SML or SMP or maternity allowance.83
So for example, in the unusual situation where the mother is entitled
to maternity allowance but not to SML, P would be entitled to SPL
but the mother would not.
SPL can be taken at any time between the date of birth and the
child’s first birthday. It must be taken in whole weeks, but it can be
taken as one continuous period or broken up (‘discontinuous
leave’).84 Where the mother returns to work before the end of her
SML, the total amount of SPL available is 52 weeks less the number
of weeks SML which she has already taken. Where the mother has
instead served a maternity leave curtailment notice, it is 52 weeks
less the period from the start of her SML to the curtailment date in
the notice.85 There are different rules in the small number of cases
where the mother is not entitled to SML. The two weeks CML (four
weeks for certain factory workers) must be taken by the mother. The
way the SPL is shared between the mother and P depends on the
agreement they make between them.
The mother must give her employer a written ‘notice of
entitlement’ at least eight weeks before she intends to take the first
period of SPL.86 The notice must state her name, P’s name, the
child’s EWC and the actual date of birth, the start and end dates of
any SML taken or to be taken by her, the total amount of SPL
available, how much SPL she and P each intend to take and an
indication of the dates when she intends to take SPL. Ultimately the
mother can take SPL on different dates, but the point is to give the

11.43

employer some idea of what she has in mind. If the child has not yet
been born, the mother must notify the date as soon as practicable
after birth and in advance of any period of SPL to be taken. The
mother must also provide signed declarations from P and herself,
essentially confirming their eligibility for SPL. P’s declaration must
give his/her name and address and NI number and give consent to the
amount of leave which the mother says she intends to take in the
notice of entitlement.87 In order to take his/her own period of SPL, P
must serve his/her own employer with a very similar notice of
entitlement and declarations.88 There are various rules if the mother
and P wish to vary the notice of entitlement so as to change the
amount of leave each of them intend to take.89 Within 14 days of her
notice of entitlement, the employer can ask the mother for a copy of
the child’s birth certificate and the name and address of P’s
employer. P’s employer can make a similar request of P. The birth
certificate (or a declaration where one has not yet been issued) must
be supplied within 14 days of the child’s birth. The details of the
other person’s employment must be provided within 14 days of the
request.90
The mother and P must also each give their employer a ‘period of
leave notice’ (informally known as a ‘booking notice’), which sets
out the start and end dates of each period of requested SPL. The
notice can be provided at the same time as the notice of entitlement,
but in any event, must be given to the employer at least eight weeks
before the earliest date requested in the notice.91 A notice can
contain a request for a continuous block or leave, and provided the
correct notifications have been made, the employer cannot refuse the
request.92 Alternatively, the notice can request a discontinuous
period, eg four weeks on, four weeks off. Where discontinuous
periods of leave are requested in a single booking notice, the
employer has two weeks within which to agree or refuse. If the
employer refuses, the employee is entitled to take the total amount
requested as a continuous period of leave, but there are further
detailed rules regarding timing and notification.93

11.44

11.45

11.46

Only three booking notices can be submitted in total, unless the
child was born early or late or the employer asks for a variation.94
After that, it is up to the employer whether to agree further periods of
SPL. If the mother and P want to vary the dates notified, they must
submit a variation notice, but this falls within the three maximum
notices.95
During SPL, an employee is entitled to the benefit of his/her terms
and conditions except for remuneration, ie sums payable as wages or
salary.96 However, an employee may well be entitled to statutory
shared parental pay (ShPP), provided s/he makes the correct
notifications. ShPP is £151.97/week or 90 per cent of the employee’s
earnings, whichever is lower.97 The mother will have to curtail her
own SMP or maternity allowance. The maximum available ShPP is
39 weeks less the amount of SMP or maternity allowance already
taken by the mother including the two weeks’ CML. Full details of
the eligibility requirements are not within the scope of this book.
There is an introductory explanation in the BEIS and ACAS guides.
A man on SPL cannot claim sex discrimination just because he is
getting paid less on SPL than a birth mother would get paid on SML.
He can only claim discrimination if a woman on SPL would have
been paid more than a man on SPL.98 As with SML, there are
keeping-in-touch (KIT) days, in this case called ‘shared parental
leave in touch’ (SPLIT) days, and unlike KIT days, there are up to 20
days for each of the mother and P. An employee can work SPLIT
days during the period when s/he is taking SPL without bringing it to
an end or losing his/her ShPP.
An employee has the right to return to the job s/he was employed
in before his/her absence with the same seniority, pension and
similar rights and on terms no less favourable than had s/he not been
absent.99 This is qualified where the employee is absent for a total of
more than 26 weeks on SPL added together with certain other
statutory leaves or is returning from the last of two or more
consecutive periods of relevant statutory leave which included a
period of parental leave of more than four weeks, a period of AML,
or a period of AAL. In such situations, if it is not reasonably

11.47

practicable for him/her to return to his/her job for a reason other than
redundancy, s/he is entitled to return to another job which is both
suitable for him/her and appropriate for him/her to do in the
circumstances.
As with SML, it is automatically unfair to make an employee
redundant during SPL if there is a suitable alternative vacancy.100 It
is also automatically unfair to dismiss the employee because s/he
took or sought to take SPL or made use of the benefits of SPL, or
because s/he considered, worked or refused to work on SPLIT
days.101 In addition, it is unlawful to subject the employee to a
detriment other than dismissal for any of these reasons.102

Parental leave
Introduction
11.48

Employees have a limited right to have unpaid leave for the purpose
of caring for a child.103 Confusingly, this is called ‘parental leave’
and must not be muddled with ‘shared parental leave’, which is
described in the previous paragraphs and concerns sharing maternity
leave. There is very basic government guidance on parental leave for
employees on the GOV.UK website, though this has no formal legal
status.104 There is no definition in the MPL Regs 1999 of what
‘caring for a child’ means, but the GOV.UK guidance says the leave
can be to look at new schools, settle children into new childcare
arrangements, spend more time with your children or with the family
generally, eg visiting grandparents. Reasons for the leave need not be
connected with the child’s health. However, employees need to be
careful because these suggestions have not all been legally tested.
Leave is unpaid, although income support may be available.

Who is entitled?
11.49

Employees who have been continuously employed for at least one
year and who have or expect to have parental responsibility for a
child are entitled to parental leave while their child is under 18.105 It

is not necessary to have had one year’s service at the date the child
was born.

Overall scheme: how the entitlement works
Overview
11.50

11.51

11.52

11.53

An employee is entitled to a total of 18 weeks’ leave in respect of
each child.106 A part-time employee’s entitlement is pro rata.107 Both
parents are entitled to parental leave. The mother can seek to take
parental leave immediately after her SML if she wishes.
During parental leave, an employee is entitled to the benefit of the
employer’s implied obligation of trust and confidence and any terms
and conditions relating to notice pay on termination; compensation in
the case of redundancy; and disciplinary or grievance procedures.
The employee is bound by the implied term of trust and confidence;
the obligation to give notice of termination; the obligation not to
disclose confidential information; and not to participate in any other
business; and obligations regarding acceptance of gifts and
benefits.108
The government had wanted collective or workforce agreements
to be made, setting out detailed rules regarding how a parental leave
scheme would work, and that such schemes would be incorporated
into individual employees’ contracts. A collective agreement or
workforce agreement cannot agree less than the minimum
entitlements, but can be more generous. It can also work out the
precise rules as to how and when leave is taken.
If there is no such collective agreed scheme, a default scheme
applies (see below).109 The default scheme may be less generous
than a scheme which could be negotiated by collective agreement.
For example, a collective agreement could negotiate more flexible
notice requirements than appear in the default scheme. Other
examples of more generous terms could include allowing more than
18 weeks in total, allowing paid leave, or allowing leave to be taken
in single days or in the form of reduced hours working.110

The default scheme
11.54

11.55

11.56

11.57

The default scheme is set out in MPL Regs 1999 Sch 2.111 Better
terms may be collectively agreed. The key elements of the scheme
are as follows, though for exact details the regulations should be
checked. Under the scheme, an employee cannot take more than four
weeks in respect of an individual child during a particular year. The
employee can only take the leave in one-week blocks (or part-time
equivalent), but not in single days.112 The exception is for a child
entitled to a disability living allowance (DLA), armed forces
independence payment or personal independence payment (PIP). An
employee is not entitled to the leave unless s/he produces, if
requested, any evidence to the employer which is reasonably
required to establish the employee’s responsibility for the child and
the child’s date of birth or adoption date.
The employee must give the correct notice. Except where a baby
is yet to be born or adopted, the required notice must specify the
dates the leave period will start and end, and give the employer at
least 21 days’ notice of the start. The employer can postpone this
leave if the operation of the business would be unduly disrupted,
provided the employer agrees a period of leave of equivalent length
may be taken within six months, starting on a date determined by the
employer after consulting the worker. The employer must give the
employee written notice of such postponement, stating the reason for
it, and specifying the new dates. The notice must be given to the
employee no more than seven days after the employee’s notice was
given to the employer.
If the employee is an expectant father, he need only specify the
EWC and the duration of the leave period. He must give the notice at
least 21 days in advance of the EWC. If the child is to be adopted,
the employee need only notify the expected week of placement, the
duration of the required leave, and again must give notice at least 21
days in advance.
An employee can bring an ET claim if his/her employer
unreasonably postpones or prevents him/her taking parental leave.113
The claim must be made within three months of the matters

complained of, and the ET can award compensation which it
considers just and equitable, having regard to the employer’s
behaviour and any resultant loss suffered by the employee.114

The right to return after maternity or parental
leave
Ordinary maternity leave
A woman is entitled to return to the job in which she was employed
before her absence on no less favourable terms and conditions than
had she not been absent.115 Her seniority, pension rights and similar
rights must be as if she had not been absent.116 The ‘same job’ does
not mean the woman has to be allowed to return to literally the same
position as before she went onto leave. On the other hand, the
employer cannot change her duties or workplace just because that is
allowed by the woman’s contract. Basically, the tribunal will take
account of the normal range of variation in duties and location which
occurred before the woman went onto leave. The legislation seeks to
ensure there is as little dislocation as reasonably possible in her
working life, so as to avoid adding to the burdens which will
inevitably exist in her family or private life simply because she has a
very young infant making new demands upon her.117

11.58

Additional maternity leave and/or parental leave
An employee who takes parental leave as an isolated period of four
weeks or less is entitled to return to the job in which s/he was
employed before his/her absence. The same applies if his/her
parental leave consecutively followed periods of other statutory
leave unless it included:

11.59

i)

any period of parental leave of more than four weeks; or

ii)

any period of statutory leave which when added to any other period of statutory leave
(excluding parental leave) taken in relation to the same child means that the total amount
of statutory leave taken in relation to that child totalled more than 26 weeks.118

11.60

Where the employee returns from AML or from more than four
weeks’ parental leave (whether or not preceded by another period of
statutory leave) or from a period of parental leave which is four
weeks or less but not within the above categories, the right is again
to return to the same job, except that if it is not reasonably
practicable to do so, it is only a right to return to another job which
is suitable and appropriate for the employee in the circumstances.119
The position is different where a redundancy situation arises during
maternity leave (see para 11.61).120
The employee is entitled to return on terms and conditions
(including remuneration) not less favourable than those which would
have applied had s/he not taken any maternity or parental leave and
with seniority, pension and similar rights treated as if s/he had not
been away.121 On return, the employee should therefore get any payrise awarded during his/her leave. See para 4.102 regarding accrual
of statutory annual leave.

Redundancy during maternity, adoption and
shared parental leave
11.61

11.62

Where, during OML or AML, it is not practicable due to redundancy
for the woman’s employer to continue to employ her under her
existing contract of employment, the woman must be offered any
suitable available vacancy with her employer or an associated
employer.122 The terms and conditions (including capacity and place)
must not be substantially less favourable than had she continued
under the previous contract.123 It is up to the employer, knowing what
it does about the employee, to decide whether the vacancy is
suitable. Suitability includes refers to the terms and conditions as
well as the suitability of the job itself.124
The offer must be made before the end of her existing contract of
employment and must start immediately on the ending of her existing
contract of employment. There are similar rights where an employee
on adoption leave or shared parental leave is made redundant.125

This special right does not apply when a woman’s position becomes
redundant during pregnancy.

Rights during leave
Overview
11.63

11.64

11.65

Less favourable treatment of a woman because she is absent on
maternity leave is unlawful maternity discrimination under EqA 2010
s18(3) or (4) and the previous domestic and EU case-law.126 A
woman should be told of any job vacancies arising while she is on
leave in which she may be interested. Failure to do so could amount
to a fundamental breach of trust and confidence entitling her to
resign,127 and may also be pregnancy or maternity discrimination. It
is discriminatory to fail to give a woman a performance-related pay
assessment because she has been absent on maternity leave.128
Similarly, a woman must be given the benefit of any pay-rise
awarded before or during maternity leave.129
Despite these cases, a woman cannot argue that she should be paid
full wages during maternity leave purely because her absence is
pregnancy-related.130 This is because women on maternity leave are
in a special position that affords them special protection, but which
is not comparable with the position of other workers. The only
requirement under EU law is that maternity pay must not fall below
an adequate level, ie that of statutory sick benefits.131 This
requirement is normally satisfied by the level of SMP.132 Even where
the contract gives contractual sick pay, but not contractual maternity
pay, this is not sex or pregnancy or maternity discrimination.133 The
same applies if there is contractual pay for both sickness and
maternity leave, but only the maternity pay must be repaid if the
woman fails to return to work for a specified time after her
absence.134
A woman on maternity leave is entitled to the benefit of her terms
and conditions except for remuneration (and is also bound by
obligations) which would apply if she was not absent.135 This
includes non-contractual matters which are connected with her

employment.136 ‘Remuneration’ refers only to sums payable as
wages or salary.137 This suggests that the woman will still be entitled
to benefits in kind, eg health insurance and company cars. If a woman
is paid contractual maternity pay, it must be calculated on the basis
of any pay increase which she received during her pregnancy or SML
(or would have received if she was not on maternity leave).138 It is
discriminatory to deprive a woman of a bonus (whether contractual
or discretionary), payable in respect of a period before or after her
pregnancy and SML, or in respect of the compulsory leave period
(usually two weeks).139 It seems it is not discriminatory to reduce a
woman’s contractual bonus in respect of any other period when she
was absent on maternity leave.140 For the position regarding annual
leave entitlement, see para 4.102. An occupational pension scheme
is deemed to include a maternity equality rule.141 The law on
pensions and equality is very complex and outside the scope of this
book. As a rough guide, terms related to membership of the scheme
or accrual of rights under the scheme or determination of the amount
of benefit under the scheme must treat time when the woman is on
maternity leave as time when she is not on leave. In regard to accrual
of rights, this only applies during AML for periods where the woman
was getting paid SMP or contractual maternity pay. The woman’s
contributions to the scheme during her leave need only be determined
by reference to the amount she is paid while on leave.

Keeping in touch
11.66

An employee can carry out up to ten days’ work or training for her
employer during her SML without bringing the leave to an end or
losing her maternity pay.142 It is for the employer and employee to
agree any additional payments for working those days. The days can
be worked singly or in blocks. Any work carried out on a particular
day counts as a day’s work. The maternity leave period does not get
extended if the employee does choose to work any of these days. In
addition, reasonable contact can be made from time to time by the
woman or her employer, eg to discuss arrangements for the woman’s
return to work. Contact can be made in any way, eg by telephone,

11.67

email, letter or in person. What amounts to ‘reasonable’ presumably
depends on all the circumstances – the type of work, any agreement
between the woman and the employer before her leave, whether
there is important information to communicate, and what the woman
feels happy with.
Neither the employer nor the employee can insist on work being
carried out during maternity leave. If a woman is dismissed or
otherwise penalised for refusing to do such work, she can claim
automatic unfair dismissal or unlawful detriment.143 No work must
be carried out in the two-week compulsory leave period following
childbirth.

Statutory maternity pay
11.68

Women who meet the service and earnings qualifying conditions can
claim SMP for 39 weeks of their leave period. A woman must have
been continuously employed for at least 26 weeks ending with the
fifteenth week before her EWC. A woman should give 28 days’
notice of when she wants her SMP to begin, in writing if the
employer requests. Normally she cannot start receiving SMP until
she has reached the eleventh week before her EWC (although she
need not still be employed by then). She also cannot receive SMP
until she has stopped work entirely for the employer (except for KIT
days, which are exempt – see para 11.66). Subject to the above, it
does not matter if the woman is made redundant or otherwise leaves
the employment before or after her maternity pay period begins.
Moreover, if the employer dismisses her before she reaches 26
weeks’ service or before the fifteenth week before her EWC, and she
can prove this was to avoid liability for SMP, she can still claim,
provided she had been employed for at least eight weeks at the time
of dismissal. A woman’s right to receive SMP is not dependent on
whether she intends to return to work after the child is born, and an
employer cannot try to recover SMP if she does not return. However,
a woman can be required to return the amount of any higher
contractual maternity pay if she does not return to work afterwards, if
there is a contractual agreement to that effect.144 SMP is paid at 90

per cent of the woman’s average pay, but subject to a weekly
maximum of £151.97145 after the first six weeks. If the woman was
on furlough, weekly earnings are calculated by reference to what she
would have been paid if not furloughed.146 Women who do not
qualify for SMP may be able to claim maternity allowance. The
calculation of SMP must take account of any pay rises between the
start of the period over which maternity pay is calculated and the end
of maternity leave.147 The above is a loose overview, without all the
detailed rules, and should not be relied on for giving advice in
individual cases. Social security benefits are not within the scope of
this book and specialist advice must be obtained in this area.

Contractual rights to maternity or parental leave
11.69

Where an employee is entitled to maternity or parental leave and
also has a right under his/her contract of employment, s/he cannot
exercise each right separately, but may take advantage of whichever
right is in any particular respect the more favourable.148

Dependant leave
11.70

An employee is entitled to reasonable unpaid149 time off to take
action necessary for any of the following purposes:150
a)

to provide assistance on an occasion when a dependant is injured or assaulted, falls ill or
gives birth;

b)

to make care arrangements for a dependant who is ill or injured;

c)

in consequence of the death of a dependant;

d)

because of the unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of a
dependant;

e)

to deal with an incident involving the employee’s child which occurs unexpectedly while
the child is at an educational establishment.

11.71

There is no minimum length of service required for this entitlement.
The employee may not have time off to allow him/her personally to
provide care beyond the reasonable amount necessary to deal with
the immediate crisis.151 If the dependant has an underlying medical

11.72

11.73

11.74

11.75

condition which is likely to cause regular relapses, the situation is no
longer covered.152 Time off due to an ‘unexpected disruption’ to care
arrangements is not confined to sudden emergencies, although the
time lapse between the employee becoming aware of the future
disruption and the date of that disruption may affect whether it is
‘necessary’ for the employee to take the time.153 For example, it may
be necessary to take the leave if an employee has received only two
weeks’ notice of the unavailability of a childminder, but it is unlikely
to be necessary if s/he has had six months’ forewarning.
The employee’s time off in consequence of the death of a
dependant includes such matters as making arrangements for and
attending the funeral, applying for probate and being interviewed by
the probate office, but it does not extend to time off for a
bereavement reaction by way of compassionate leave.154 There is a
separate entitlement to parental bereavement leave (see below).
To have the right to dependant leave, the worker must tell the
employer, as soon as reasonably practicable, how long s/he expects
to be absent and the reason.155 S/he needs to say enough to indicate
the nature of the problem and that something has happened which
makes it urgent to leave work, but s/he does not need formally to
spell out all the circumstances.156 The amount of time off which is
‘reasonable’ depends on the individual circumstances. The employer
can take account of the number, length and dates of previous
absences, but cannot take account of any disruption or inconvenience
caused to the business.157
A ‘dependant’ means a spouse, civil partner, child, parent or
person (other than a tenant, lodger or employee) who lives in the
employee’s household, eg a grandparent or cohabitee. In relation to
the right to time off in categories a), b) or d) above, it also includes
anyone who reasonably relies on the employee for assistance or to
make arrangements in those circumstances.158
An employee can complain to an employment tribunal (ET) within
three months of any refusal of such time off. The ET can award
compensation which it considers just and equitable including for
resulting loss.159

Parental bereavement leave
11.76

11.77

11.78

11.79

11.80

An employee who is the bereaved parent of a child is entitled to take
up to two weeks’ bereavement leave within 56 weeks of the death of
the child.160 A ‘child’ means someone under the age of 18 and
includes a baby who is stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy.161
Parental bereavement leave can only be taken as two consecutive
weeks or in two periods of one week each.162
An employee can take the leave if s/he is the natural parent,
adoptive parent, a person with whom the child was placed for
adoption, or the partner of a parent or adoptive parent.163 It also
includes a ‘parent in fact’, ie a person in whose home the child had
been living for at least four weeks at the date of death and who had
day-to-day responsibility for their care, but not on a paid basis, and
not if the child’s parent or someone with parental responsibility
lived in the same premises. The employee does not need to have any
minimum length of service.
The employee must notify the employer of the date of death or
stillbirth, when the leave will start and its length. This need not be in
writing. If leave is to start within 56 days of the date of death or
stillbirth, notification must be given before the first leave day or as
soon as reasonably practicable afterwards. For later leave, the
employee must give at least seven days’ notice.164
As with maternity, adoption and shared parental leave, employees
on parental bereavement leave continues to have the benefit of their
terms and conditions except in relation to wages or salary. They also
continue to be bound by their contractual obligations except those
inconsistent with being on leave.165 The employee has the right to
return to the same job. If the bereavement leave follows other leaves,
that right is modified.166
If an employee has 26 weeks’ continuous employment ending with
the week before the bereavement and meets the minimum earnings
condition, s/he is entitled to statutory parental bereavement pay. This
is 90 per cent of the employee’s weekly pay, subject to a maximum of
£151.97.167 The employee needs to give notice to show eligibility.

11.81

ACAS has general guidance on time off for bereavement on its
website, including this new right to parental bereavement leave and
pay.168 There is a sample bereavement policy for downloading,
which contains considerations of how return to work should be
managed.

Detriments and automatic unfair dismissal
11.82

It is automatically unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee for a
number of reasons related to the fact that s/he has taken maternity,
paternity, adoption, parental, shared parental, dependant or
bereavement leave. No minimum qualifying service is required. It is
also unlawful to subject an employee to a detriment other than
dismissal for any of those reasons. See paras 6.70–6.73 for the
reasons and exceptions.

Suspension from work on maternity grounds
11.83

11.84

The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSW
Regs) 1999169 together with ERA 1996 ss66–68 implement the
health and safety provisions in EU Pregnant Workers Directive
Articles 4 and 5.170 The rules on health and safety suspension appear
only to apply to women who are employees.171 The Health and
Safety Executive (HSE) provides some guidance for employers and
for expectant mothers.172
As part of their general duty to carry out risk assessment in the
workplace,173 where employees include women of child-bearing age
and the work could involve a risk to the mother or baby, employers
must include any risk which might be posed to a new or expectant
mother.174 Once the woman has notified her employer in writing that
she is pregnant, has given birth in the previous six months or is
breast-feeding, the employer must carry out a specific risk
assessment in relation to her. The assessment need not be in writing.
Where the risk cannot otherwise be avoided, the employer must alter
the woman’s working conditions or hours of work.175 If it is not
reasonable to do this or it would not avoid the risk, the employer

should suspend the woman from work for as long as necessary.176
This is the woman’s entitlement to a health and safety suspension.177
However, the woman is entitled to be offered any available suitable
alternative work before being suspended.178
Failure to carry out a risk assessment for a pregnant woman can be
sex discrimination in itself, but only if the woman’s work is of a kind
which could put her at risk.179 If the woman resigns because no risk
assessment was done, it may also be constructive dismissal.180
Conversely, it would be sex discrimination for an employer to
impose a change of duties or suspension on an unwilling woman,
where it is not necessary because of a low level of risk.181 In most
situations, however, it is the woman who wants an adjustment to be
made and the employer who is unsympathetic.
The woman is entitled to be paid during her suspension, unless she
has turned down an offer of suitable alternative work for the relevant
period.182 The work must be of a kind which is both suitable in
relation to the woman and appropriate for her to do in the
circumstances, and on terms and conditions not substantially less
favourable than her normal terms and conditions.183 The woman must
produce a medical certificate confirming her pregnancy within a
reasonable time of any written request to do so by her employer.184
The risks covered may include night-working185 and any physical,
biological or chemical agent which carries risk to the health and
safety of a new or expectant mother, including the risks specified in
Annexes I and II to the Pregnant Workers Directive.186 Physical risks
include:

11.85

11.86

11.87

•

extremes of heat and cold;

•

prolonged exposure to loud noise;

•

manual handling of loads;

•

regular exposure to shocks and low-frequency vibration;

•

working in tightly fitted workstations;

•

excessive physical or mental pressure causing stress and anxiety;

•

fatigue from standing and other physical work;

•

travelling inside or outside the establishment.

Steps to avoid risks could include:
•

ensuring available seating;

•

granting longer and more frequent rest breaks;

•

adjusting workstations;

•

ensuring that hours and volume of work are not excessive and that, where possible, the
woman has some control over how her work is organised.

11.88

11.89

The provisions regarding fatigue are particularly important, but their
scope in practice is untested. An example would seem to be as
follows: a woman may find that due to pregnancy-related fatigue, she
is unable to work her full hours. Her employer must allow her to
work reduced hours on full pay (or, if it sufficed, alter her duties so
they were less tiring). If the woman became unable to work at all,
she must be suspended on full pay. It would be automatically unfair
to dismiss her for these reasons.
Where a woman is suspended without pay, she may claim her pay
from an ET. Where she is on paid suspension but the employer has
failed to offer some available suitable alternative work, an ET may
award any sum it considers just and equitable, with no ceiling.187
The time limit for these claims is three months from the date the
suspension started.188 It is automatically unfair to dismiss a woman
because of her entitlement to a medical suspension and it is unlawful
to subject her to a detriment for that reason.189 It is also automatic
unfair dismissal to dismiss a woman who refuses to work in a
situation which she reasonably believes may entail serious and
imminent danger and unlawful to subject her to a detriment for that
reason.190 If a woman is injured as a result of the employer’s failure
to comply with the MHSW Regs 1999, she may sue for damages.191

Time off for antenatal care
11.90

A pregnant employee must not be unreasonably refused time off
during her working hours to attend an appointment for antenatal care,
which has been made on the advice of a medical practitioner,
registered midwife or registered health visitor.192 Apart from on the
first appointment, if her employer so requests, the woman must

11.91

11.92

produce a certificate from one of the latter, confirming her pregnancy
and a document proving the appointment has been made.193 Antenatal
care probably includes relaxation classes attended on medical
advice.194 If the woman is allowed the time off, she is entitled to be
paid for it.195 Agency workers who have completed the 12-week
qualifying period196 are similarly entitled to time off during an
assignment for antenatal care which should be paid at the appropriate
hourly rate by the agency.197 Compensation for unreasonable refusal
to allow the time off is double the employee’s usual pay for the time
she should have been allowed.198
In addition, an employee who is the partner of a pregnant
employee (whether her spouse or civil partner or an unmarried
partner who lives with her in an enduring family relationship) has the
right to unpaid time off during working hours to accompany the
pregnant employee while she attends her antenatal appointment on up
to two occasions for a maximum of six and a half hours each
(including travel and waiting time).199 The father of the expected
child who is not the mother’s partner, and prospective parents in a
surrogacy arrangement who intend to apply for a parental order, also
have this entitlement. If the employer so requests, the employee must
provide a written statement confirming the date and time of the
appointment, his/her relationship to the pregnant employee or child
and confirming that the appointment was made on the advice of a
registered medical practitioner, midwife or nurse. The employer
cannot ask for the pregnant employee’s certificate, as that is her
property. Agency workers who have completed the 12-week
qualifying period have the same rights to accompany.200 If the
employer refuses the time off, the employee or agency worker can
claim compensation which is twice the hourly rate for the number of
hours involved.201 BIS produced a guide for employers, Time off to
accompany a pregnant woman to antenatal appointments:
employer guide (September 2014), which explains the right to
accompany in simple terms, though it has no legal status.202
It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee for taking
time off for antenatal care,203 or for taking time off to accompany a

11.93

11.94

woman to antenatal care appointments.204 Similarly it is unlawful to
subject an agency worker to a detriment for taking time off for
antenatal care or to accompany his/her partner to antenatal care
appointments.205
Employees who have been notified by an adoption agency that
their child is to be placed for adoption are entitled to take paid time
off during working hours to attend up to five appointments of up to
six and a half hours each in connection with the adoption or for
contact with the child.206 The appointments must have been arranged
by the adoption agency. The employer can ask for documentary proof
and a signed declaration. This entitlement does not apply once the
adoption placement has happened. Where two prospective parents
have been notified, only one of them can take the paid time off. The
other is entitled to unpaid time off on two of the occasions.207
Agency workers have equivalent rights.208 It is automatic unfair
dismissal to dismiss an employee for a reason related to taking time
off for such adoption appointments and it is unlawful to subject an
employee to a detriment for such reasons.209 It is also unlawful to
subject an agency worker to a detriment for exercising his/her rights
to attend an adoption appointment (whether the paid or unpaid
entitlement).210
In all these cases relating to leave for antenatal care and adoption
appointments, an ET complaint must be made within three months of
the relevant appointment. Time may be extended if it was not
reasonably practicable to do so.211 The ACAS early conciliation
(EC) procedure applies.212

Agency workers and maternity
11.95

Provided they are covered by the EqA 2010,213 agency workers must
not be discriminated against because of their pregnancy. The general
rules regarding pregnancy and maternity discrimination generally are
set out in the rest of this chapter. So, for example, it would be
unlawful pregnancy discrimination if an agency refused to take a
worker on or to offer her placements because she was pregnant, or

11.96

11.97

only offered her short placements for that reason. It would also be
pregnancy discrimination if a particular hirer refused to accept a
woman on a placement because she was pregnant. The law is more
complicated if the agency or hirer refuses to let the woman return to
her previous assignment after maternity leave. Although EqA 2010
s18 makes it unlawful discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably
because she has taken statutory maternity leave, an agency worker
may not have been entitled to take such statutory leave. There may be
other arguments which succeed, perhaps relying on sex
discrimination under EqA 2010 s13, but these are not explored here.
Agency workers who have completed the 12-week qualifying
period have the same rights as employees to time off for antenatal
care and adoption appointments. This is explained at para 11.90.
There is also a right to a health and safety suspension on maternity
grounds for agency workers who have met the 12-week qualifying
period.214 The protection is very similar to that available for
permanent employees (see para 11.90 onwards), save with the
additional complication that both the hirer and the agency have
duties. The rules are set out in the MHSW Regs 1999215 regs 16A,
17A, 18A and 18AB; and ERA 1996 ss68A–68D, 69A and 70A. The
protection lasts for the duration, or originally intended duration, of
the worker’s assignment. The duties of the hirer (or end-user) and
agency are triggered when the agency worker notifies them that she is
pregnant, has given birth within the previous six months or is
breastfeeding. Where there is a relevant risk, in the first instance it is
for the hirer to alter the worker’s conditions or hours if it is
reasonable to do so. If there is no suitable reasonable adjustment, the
hirer must tell the agency immediately, which will then stop sending
the worker to the hirer. The agency must then offer any suitable
alternative work on terms and conditions which are not substantially
less favourable. The worker is entitled to be paid by the agency for
the assignment period unless she was offered suitable alternative
work which she unreasonably refused.216
Paras 11.84–11.85 deal with an employer’s duty to carry out a
pregnancy risk assessment in respect of employees. Case-law prior

to the passing of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 already
suggested that in some circumstances, an employment agency would
have the duty to carry out the risk assessment and would be guilty of
sex discrimination if it failed to do so.217 The BEIS guide on the
Agency Workers Regulations218 says that if the nature of the
assignment is such that there is a potential risk to health and safety,
the agency must ask the hirer to carry out a risk assessment and the
hirer must carry it out.

Part-time working and other problematic hours or
locations
Introduction
There is no absolute right to work part-time, though unjustifiable
refusal of a request may amount to indirect sex discrimination under
the EqA 2010. It may also be indirect sex discrimination under the
EqA 2010 unjustifiably to treat a part-timer less favourably than a
full-timer, eg in relation to her terms and conditions. The Part-time
Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations
(PTW Regs) 2000219 also protect part-timers’ terms and conditions.
The key differences between the PTW Regs 2000 and the EqA 2010
regarding part-timers are:

11.98

•

Because of the way the definition of indirect sex discrimination works, the EqA 2010 will
mainly protect women.

•

Under the EqA 2010, the worker needs to prove it is a particular disadvantage for women
generally as well as herself to work full-time. This is irrelevant under the PTW Regs 2000.

•

The EqA 2010 and the PTW Regs 2000 both cover discrimination in terms and conditions,
but in most situations only the EqA 2010 allows a worker to challenge a refusal to allow
him/her to work part-time. However, dismissing a worker for refusing to change from parttime to full-time work would potentially be unlawful under the PTW Regs 2000.

•

The PTW Regs 2000 require a comparator.

•

The EqA 2010 enables workers to challenge other types of requirement which do not fit in
with childcare, eg start or finish times. The PTW Regs 2000 only deal with part-time
working.

11.99

In many ways, the PTW Regs 2000 are simpler to use than the EqA
2010. However, where possible, a worker should claim both under
the PTW Regs 2000 and the EqA 2010. Although more difficult to
prove, the advantage of an EqA 2010 claim is that it may attract
additional compensation, eg for injury to feelings (though not if it is
an equal pay claim).220 The ACAS EC procedure applies both to sex
discrimination claims under the EqA 2010 and to claims under the
PTW Regs 2000.221

Part-time working and sex discrimination
Is there a right to work part-time?
11.100 There is no absolute right in sex discrimination law to work part-

time or to job share. However, a number of cases have accepted that
women are adversely affected due to childcare responsibilities when
only full-time work is available, and this can be unlawful as indirect
sex discrimination. More recently, there has been recognition that
workers may need time off to care for adult relatives. The evidence
indicates that women are more likely to be carers for adults than
men,222 but there have been few cases on this specific point.
11.101
The main case establishing that refusal to let women work parttime may be unlawful indirect sex discrimination was Home Office v
Holmes223 in 1984. The stages of proving indirect discrimination are
dealt with at para 13.27 onwards.
Is full-time working a provision, criterion or practice?
11.102 There

should be no difficulty in proving that an employer who
requires a woman to work full-time is imposing a provision,
criterion or practice (PCP) that she do so.224
Is full-time working a disadvantage?

11.103 The woman no longer needs to prove that she ‘cannot comply’225

with the full-time work requirement – she only needs to show that
she is put at a ‘disadvantage’. Many of the cases under the pre-2001
definition insisted the woman must prove she was completely unable

to work full-time, eg because she could not afford or find suitable
childcare. These cases ignored the reality that many women wish to
work part-time because they feel it makes their children happier or
easier to deal with, or because it is a physical and emotional strain
to work full-time while bringing up children, or to keep rearranging
childcare.
11.104
A few of the very early cases did recognise this. In Holmes the ET
noted that attempting to fulfil parental responsibilities and work fulltime entailed excessive demands on Ms Holmes’ time and energy. In
Price, another early case, the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)
stated quite clearly that although a woman ‘is not obliged to marry,
or to have children, or to mind children; she may find somebody to
look after them’, but to say that for those reasons she can comply
with a requirement to work full-time would be ‘wholly out of
sympathy with the spirit and intent of the Act’.226
11.105
As we have said, under the current definition of indirect
discrimination, a woman only has to show that full-time working puts
her at a disadvantage. The disadvantage need not be economic, but
could for example, include the stress of maintaining practical
childcare arrangements or physical tiredness. It does not need to be
impossible to comply with a requirement before there is
disadvantage. The fact that compliance is possible but only with real
difficulty or with additional arrangements having to be made or by
shifting the childcare burden onto someone else can still mean there
is a disadvantage.227
11.106
It is not quite clear whether it is enough that a woman simply
wants to spend more time with her child, though Price (see above),
suggested that it should be. If an ET takes an unsympathetic
approach, a woman will be in difficulty if she has demonstrated that,
pending the tribunal hearing, she can in fact work full-time without
undue difficulty. On the other hand, she will not want to resign if
there is a chance that the ET can help her. This is a good reason for
asking the ET for an early hearing date on the ground that the
woman’s job is in jeopardy because she cannot continue working.
Sometimes an employer may agree that she works part-time pending

the result. If not, she may have to show the ET that her childcare
arrangements could only be sustained in the short term and were
causing great stress, expense or inconvenience. A woman could try
to avoid this trap by using up her days off to work part-time in
practice. Ms Holmes took six months’ sick leave. Having said that,
maybe this approach is unnecessarily cautious. The former President
of the EAT made a useful observation in one of the first cases to look
closely at the current definition of indirect discrimination (albeit an
age discrimination case).228 He said that a woman who wished to
work part-time for childcare reasons but was forced to work fulltime because she would otherwise lose her job, may well be
considered at a ‘disadvantage’ for the purpose of the current
definition.
Would it put women at a particular disadvantage?
11.107 The worker needs to show that full-time working would put women

at a particular disadvantage compared with men. The EAT has said
that tribunals must accept that there is a ‘childcare disparity’ which
means that women are more likely to find it difficult to work certain
hours, eg nights, or changeable hours imposed by the employer.229 If
the PCP requires working to such arrangements (or, presumably,
working full-time), the group disadvantage is highly likely to follow.
Other kinds of fixed hours or arrangements (see para 11.111 below)
might not necessarily be more difficult for those with childcare
responsibilities and would need to be proved.
Is the requirement justifiable?
11.108 To be justifiable, employers must prove that insisting on full-time

working is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. This
depends very much on the facts and practicalities of the particular
case. In one old case,230 for example, a health visitor was permitted
to work part-time after maternity leave, provided her hours were
spread over five days. The worker objected that this involved her in
greater expenses for the same wage. Nevertheless, the EAT found the
requirement justified because patients needed regular personal

contact and health visitors should be available five days a week for
consultation with doctors or social workers. On the other hand, there
have been many similar cases where tribunals have found employers
unjustified in refusing job-share or part-time working in a whole
variety of jobs. The crucial point is that a tribunal must not simply
consider whether the employer has a good reason for requiring the
woman to work full-time; it must balance the employer’s reasons
against the discriminatory effect on women.231
11.109
The increasing move towards part-time and flexible working,
backed by enabling legislation, means it is harder for employers than
in the past to justify insisting on full-time working or treating parttimers less favourably. In negotiating with her employer or running a
case, a woman could point to the Best Practice Guidelines
accompanying the PTW Regs 2000.232
Common forms of discrimination against part-timers
11.110 The application of the redundancy selection criterion of part-timers
first may well be unlawful sex discrimination.233 Most difficulties

facing part-time workers, however, concern less favourable terms
and conditions, particularly indirect discrimination in ‘pay’ in its
broadest sense. Because Article 157 (formerly 141) of the Treaty of
Rome is binding on all employers,234 EU law has been very helpful
in securing equality of pay, pension contributions, sick pay, etc.
Examples of indirect discrimination against part-timers or jobsharers include (subject to justification):
•

requiring a longer period of part-time service than full-time service in order to be eligible for
promotion;235

•

on a job-sharer converting to full-time working, placing her on the incremental scale
according to actual hours worked in the post in the past, so that she is lower in the scale
than had she worked the same number of years full-time.236

Shifts, flexible hours and mobility: sex discrimination
11.111

A requirement that an employee work shifts or flexible hours may
indirectly discriminate against a woman because of childcare

commitments. Similarly, an employer’s attempt to alter a woman’s
hours (whether or not permitted to do so by her contract), even in a
minor way, may be indirect discrimination if, for example, it
interferes with her arrangements for collecting her children from
school. Conversely, an employer’s refusal to allow a woman to
arrive or leave half an hour late or early in order to transport her
children to and from school, may be discriminatory. In all cases, the
main issue is likely to be whether the change or refusal is justifiable.
Similar considerations apply with mobility requirements. In one
case, where a lone parent was unable to comply with new flexi-rotas
due to childcare, the EAT said that employers should consider
carefully the impact which a new roster might have on a section of
their workforce and take a reasonably flexible attitude towards
accommodating a worker’s particular needs.237 The stages of
proving an indirect sex discrimination case in these various
circumstances will be as set out in the part-time working and jobshare section above.
11.112
On the other hand, any assumption made by an employer that
women will be less mobile or flexible is directly discriminatory.
Interview questions concerning mobility or flexibility, if asked only
of female candidates, are likely to lead to poorer interview
performance and constitute direct discrimination in the arrangements
made for determining who should be offered employment.238
Similarly, it may be direct sex discrimination to allow a man to work
part-time or to be flexible with his hours, but not a woman (or vice
versa).

The Part-time Workers Regulations
11.113 The PTW Regs 2000239 were brought in to implement the EU Parttime Work Directive.240 As at early 2021, there were over 7.7

million part-time workers in the UK. Prior to the Covid-19
pandemic, there were slightly more. In introducing the regulations,
the government at the time said it believed the economy and society
would gain as a whole if people were able to achieve a better
balance between work and family responsibilities.

The PTW Regs 2000 are not confined to employees, and cover any
individual working under an oral or written contract whereby s/he
undertakes to perform work or services personally. It excludes
situations where the employer is a client or customer of a business
carried out by the individual.241
11.115
A part-time worker must not be treated less favourably than a
comparable full-time worker on the ground that s/he is a part-timer
as regards his/her contract terms or by being subjected to any other
detriment.242 The worker cannot rely on a hypothetical
comparator.243 A comparable full-time worker means someone who,
at the time of the less favourable treatment, is employed by the same
employer, under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or
broadly similar work.244 The work need not be identical as long as a
large amount of it is the same. Comparison must be made with a
worker at the same establishment, unless the only comparable
worker is at a different establishment. Also, if the worker changes
from full-time to part-time working, s/he must not be treated less
favourably than beforehand.245
11.116
In Scotland, the worker must show that his/her part-time status is
the only reason that s/he has been treated less favourably. In England
and Wales, the cases are inconsistent as to whether it is sufficient
simply for it to be one reason.246 Once a worker proves less
favourable treatment on grounds of being a part-timer, a ‘pro rata
principle’ applies, ie a part-timer must not receive a lesser
proportion of a full-timer’s pay or other benefit, than the proportion
that the number of his/her weekly hours bears to the number of
weekly hours of the full-timer.247 As with the EqA 2010, there is an
exception if the employer can objectively justify less favourable
treatment.248 In addition, a part-timer cannot claim equivalent
overtime rates until s/he has worked more hours than the comparable
full-timer has worked (excluding absences and overtime) in the
relevant period.249
11.117
The part-timer can request a written statement detailing reasons
for any treatment s/he considers less favourable,250 though on
dismissal she must request written reasons under ERA 1996 s92.251
11.114

It is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee for requesting
such a statement or for claiming any rights under these regulations in
good faith.252 It is also unlawful to subject a worker to a detriment
including dismissal.
11.118
A worker can claim compensation from an ET if his/her employer
breaches the regulations, but s/he cannot claim for injury to feelings
for less favourable treatment as a part-time worker.253
11.119
Some examples of the effect of the regulations are that, unless the
employer can objectively justify otherwise:
•

Current or past part-time status should not constitute a barrier to promotion.

•

Part-time workers should receive the same hourly rate as comparable full-time workers.

•

Part-timers should not be less favourably treated than full-timers in calculating the rate of
sick pay, how long it is paid, or the length of service required to qualify for payment.

•

Employers should not discriminate against part-timers over access to pension schemes.

•

Part-timers should not be excluded from training.

•

Part-timers should not be targeted for redundancy selection.

11.120 At the time of passing the regulations, the government issued Best
Practice Guidelines.254 Although the PTW Regs 2000 give no right to

work part-time, the Best Practice Guidelines make useful
recommendations which can be used in indirect sex discrimination
cases:
•

At all levels of an organisation, including skilled and managerial positions, employers should
seek to maximise the range of posts designated as suitable for part-time working or job
share.

•

Larger organisations should keep a database of those interested in job share.

•

Employers should actively consider whether it would be appropriate to introduce flexible
forms of working, eg term-time working, lunch-time working, flexi-time, homeworking, a
parental leave scheme and reduced-hours working.

•

Larger organisations should consider whether to provide childcare facilities on site or offer
a contribution towards childcare costs.

Flexible working
Overview

11.121 The original right to request flexible working was introduced in

2003 and applied to requests to change hours or work from home for
childcare purposes. This was expanded in 2007 to include caring for
adult relatives. Since 30 June 2014, it has no longer been necessary
that the request be for caring purposes. When negotiating with
employers, it is useful to refer to the survey evidence of the benefits
to them of flexible working, eg there is an interesting Chartered
Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) report, Employee
outlook: Focus on commuting and flexible working – Survey report
(April 2016).255 There is also ACAS guidance on working from
home, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, on its website.256
11.122
The law is contained in ERA 1996 ss80F–80I and expanded in the
Flexible Working Regulations 2014.257 There is government
guidance on the GOV.UK website, though it has no legal status. There
is also an ACAS Code of Practice aimed at employers: Handling in
a reasonable manner requests to work flexibly (June 2014).258 The
code must be taken into account by tribunals when deciding cases
under the regulations. The legislation does not give any right to work
flexibly, but it makes it easier for an employee to make the request
and have it properly considered. Of course, any worker can ask
his/her employer for changes in hours or other flexible arrangements
without following any statutory procedure. However, if the worker
wants to invoke the specific statutory right to make a request, there
are certain conditions.
11.123
An eligible employee may apply to his/her employer for a change
in his/her terms and conditions of employment regarding hours, time
of work or working partly or wholly from home.259 Any permitted
change will be permanent (unless agreed otherwise) and the
employee will have no right to revert back to his/her former hours of
work. The rules do not offer the option of an employer imposing a
trial period: it is either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the employee’s request.
However, there is nothing to stop the parties agreeing to a trial
period if either of them is unsure whether the change would work.
11.124
The GOV.UK guidance gives examples of different types of
flexible working, including:

•

part-time working and job share;

•

staggered hours;

•

homeworking;

•

annual hours;

•

compressed hours (working the same number of hours over a shorter period); and

•

phased retirement.

There are also other possibilities, eg:
•

shift-swapping;

•

term-time working; or

•

slightly reduced hours (such as starting an hour later each day). Working fewer hours will
of course usually mean less pay.

Any employee can apply for flexible working provided s/he has at
least 26 weeks’ continuous service. As already stated, it is no longer
necessary that the purpose of the request is to care for children or
adult relatives. However, if the request is refused, provided the
employer dealt with it in a procedurally correct manner, the
employee has no legal rights under this set of rules. Individuals who
have the status of ‘employee shareholders’ cannot use the flexible
working procedure, although that does not affect their ability to make
other claims if an ordinary request is refused, eg for
discrimination.260
11.126
An employee cannot make more than one application to the same
employer in 12 months.261 S/he should therefore choose a good time
to make the request. The application must be in writing and contain
the following information:262
11.125

•

the date of the current application;

•

the date of any previous application or confirmation that there has been none;

•

a statement that the application is being made under the statutory right to request flexible
working;

•

the flexible working pattern applied for and the date it should come into effect;

•

an explanation of what effect, if any, the employee thinks the proposed change will have on
the employer and suggestions as to how the effect may be dealt with.

The employee is not expected to know exactly what the effect on the
employer may be. This is just to show s/he has considered the likely
impact of the proposed change. A well thought-out application also
makes it more likely the employer will agree. The ACAS Code
recommends that employers make clear to employees what
information should be included in a written request to work flexibly.
11.127
There used to be strict procedural requirements that an employer
had to follow when dealing with the request. Now it is only
necessary that the employer deals with the application ‘in a
reasonable manner’ and notifies the employee of the decision within
three months of the application or any permitted appeal unless any
longer period is agreed.263 What is reasonable is set out in the ACAS
Code (above) and must be taken into account by a tribunal when it
decides whether the employer has correctly followed the procedure.
The ACAS Code recommends these steps: the employer should
discuss the request with the employee; consider the application
carefully; and inform the employee of the decision as soon as
possible; this should be in writing to avoid future confusion. If the
request is rejected, the employer should allow the employee to
appeal. ACAS says it can be helpful to discuss the decision with the
employee to see whether any further facts emerge.
11.128
The rules say that an application will be treated as withdrawn if
the employee, without good reason, fails to attend both a first
meeting arranged by the employer to discuss the application and the
next meeting arranged for that purpose. If the employer has allowed
an appeal, the application will be treated as withdrawn if the
employee similarly fails to attend a first and rearranged meeting. The
employer must notify the employee that s/he has decided to treat the
application as withdrawn for these reasons.264
11.129
An employer may only refuse the application on one of the
specified grounds,265 ie:
•

additional costs;

•

detrimental effect on ability to meet customer demand;

•

inability to recruit additional staff or re-organise work among existing staff;

•

detrimental impact on quality or performance;

•

insufficient work during the periods the employee proposes to work;

•

planned structural changes.

11.130 As long as the employer’s refusal falls within one of these specified
grounds and is not based on incorrect facts,266 the employee cannot

challenge the refusal under the flexible working procedure.
However, a tribunal is entitled to examine evidence as to the
circumstances leading to the refusal in case this indicates the
employer was relying on incorrect facts.267 As the grounds cover
almost every situation, the employee’s best chance of success will be
to persuade the employer to agree the request. The employee should
present a well-considered application, showing how the change will
not harm the business and may in fact benefit the employer. It may be
helpful to cite some of the positive case studies set out in the
guidance for employers mentioned above.
11.131
It is also important to consider whether the employee has other
rights, eg under his/her contract or under discrimination law. For
example, it may be direct race discrimination if the employer refuses
a request from a black worker to adjust hours when s/he has agreed a
similar request by a comparable white worker. Or it may be indirect
sex discrimination if the employer unjustifiably refuses a woman’s
request to change her hours for childcare reasons.268 Similarly, a
refusal to allow adjustments in hours to care for elderly parents
could be indirect age discrimination. A worker may also have a right
to reduce or adjust hours as a reasonable adjustment for his/her
disability.269

Enforcement
11.132 An employee can bring a tribunal claim if the employer:
•

failed to deal with the flexible working application in a reasonable manner;

•

did not notify the decision within three months or any agreed extension;

•

wrongly treated it as withdrawn; or

•

if a decision to reject the application was based on incorrect facts or an impermissible
ground.270

No claim can be brought if the application has been agreed or
withdrawn.271 The claim cannot be brought until the employer has
notified the decision (or appeal decision, if the employer allowed an
appeal). If the employer has not notified any decision, the employee
must wait until the deadline for giving such decision has expired.272
A claim regarding an incorrect notification that the employee has
withdrawn his/her application can be made immediately. The
tribunal claim must be made within three months of the date when the
employee was first allowed to make a claim in these different
situations. Late claims will be allowed only if it was not reasonably
practicable to claim in time and they have been presented within a
further reasonable period.273 If the ET finds the claim well-founded,
it can order reconsideration of the application and award such
compensation as is just and equitable up to eight weeks’ pay.
11.133
It is unlawful to subject someone to a detriment because s/he has
made or proposed to make an application for flexible working under
this procedure, or brought an ET claim, or alleged the existence of
any circumstances which would constitute a ground for bringing such
proceedings, and it is automatic unfair dismissal to dismiss someone
for any of those reasons.274 The ACAS EC procedure applies to all
these claims.275

means and EU case-law suggests it must be incorrect with regard to treatment during the
protected period. In the light of Tuleikyte, where a woman is deprived of pay rises, appraisals etc
simply because she is absent while on maternity leave, it may be wise to claim indirect sex
discrimination in the alternative.

Overview • Enforcement • Equality impact assessments

Chapter 12: Key points
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The Equality Act (EqA) 2010 replaced the previous
discrimination legislation in respect of discriminatory actions on
or after 1 October 2010.
It covers the protected characteristics of age; disability;
gender reassignment; marital or civil partnership status;
pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; and
sexual orientation.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has a
remit to oversee all discrimination and human rights law. It has
issued a statutory Code of Practice on Employment (‘the
EHRC Employment Code’) and a statutory Code of Practice
on Equal Pay.
Those working abroad under contracts which have some
connection with English law can probably use the EqA 2010,
though this is a difficult area.
The EqA 2010 has wider scope than unfair dismissal law. It
covers job applicants, apprentices, employees, former
employees, contract workers and those working on a contract
personally to do work, though not for a client or customer of
their own business. Volunteers will not usually be protected.
An employer must not discriminate in recruitment, treatment of
people at work, dismissal or post-dismissal matters such as
references. These are called ‘prohibited actions’ or ‘acts of
discrimination’.
Unless they took all reasonable preventative steps, employers
are vicariously liable for the actions of their employees carried
out in the course of their employment or for acts of their
agents. Individual employees and agents can also be liable.
There is a public sector equality duty. In carrying out their
functions, including their employment function, public authorities

must have due regard to their duty to eliminate discrimination
and advance equality of opportunity.

The legal framework
The Equality Act 2010 and previous legislation
The Equality Act (EqA) 2010 consolidated and updated the previous
legislation covering unlawful discrimination, including:

12.1

12.2

•

Equal Pay Act (EqPA) 1970;

•

Sex Discrimination Act 1975;

•

Race Relations Act 1976;

•

Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995;

•

Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003;

•

Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003;

•

Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006.

The EqA 2010 applies to any discriminatory actions on or after 1
October 2010, or where an action which was unlawful
discrimination prior to 1 October continued on or after that date.1 It
is important to be careful when relying on case-law under the old
legislation that the wording in the EqA is the same. Although the
legislation changed very little on employment discrimination apart
from a few developments in relation to disability, there were some
small changes elsewhere.
The EqA 2010 covers discrimination outside employment as well
as employment, although only employment situations are within the
scope of this book. The Act attempts to use plain English, but that is
not always helpful. Because it covers so much, the wording can
sometimes be clumsy and it is hard to find your way around. The
contents list at the beginning of the Act is very helpful in this respect,
as is the index of defined expressions in Schedule 28, right at the
end.

Equality and Human Rights Commission

12.3

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) started up in
October 2007. The EHRC replaced the Commission for Racial
Equality (CRE), the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) and the
Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) (now sometimes referred to
as the ‘legacy commissions’), and took on additional responsibility
for religion, sexual orientation and age discrimination and for human
rights. The EHRC cannot give legal assistance to individuals on
human rights cases unless there is also an equality dimension, but it
does have power to hold formal inquiries or take judicial
proceedings to prevent breaches of the Human Rights Act (HRA)
1998. The powers, budget and staff numbers of the EHRC have been
severely reduced on more than one occasion since 2010.

Codes of Practice
12.4

12.5

12.6

The EHRC has issued two statutory Codes of Practice, one on
Employment and one on Equal Pay.2 The Codes apply to England,
Scotland and Wales. The Codes do not impose legal obligations in
themselves and they do not purport to be an authoritative statement of
the law. However, they can be used in evidence in legal proceedings.
Tribunals must take into account any provision in the Codes which
appears relevant to them.3 The importance of the Codes has been
confirmed by the higher courts.4
The EHRC says the main purpose of its Employment Code is to
provide a detailed explanation of the Act, which should help
tribunals, lawyers, trade union representatives, human resources
(HR) departments and everyone else. At over 300 pages, the Code is
a somewhat daunting document. However, it is full of helpful
examples and is usefully divided into two: chapters 1–15 contain the
explanation of the Act; and chapters 16–19 set out recommended
good practice for employers.
The other document with statutory effect is the Guidance on
matters to be taken into account in determining questions relating
to the definition of disability.5 This document is discussed further in
chapter 15 in this book. When deciding whether a worker is disabled

within the meaning of the EqA 2010, a tribunal must take account of
any relevant guidance in this document.6

EU legislation and international instruments
12.7

12.8

12.9

Chapter 3 of this book sets out the framework of European Union
(EU) law. In the case of discrimination law, this derives from the
Treaty of Rome (now renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union) and a series of directives. In particular, there is the
Recast Directive (2006/54/EC) which deals with sex discrimination;
the Race Discrimination Directive (2000/43/EC) and the General
Framework Directive (2000/78/EC), which covers age, disability,
sexual orientation and religion and belief. The full titles of these are
set out in chapter 14.
An overview of the relationship between European directives and
national rights is explained in chapter 3. Although much has changed
post Brexit, it is important for understanding retained EU law to look
at how the relationship worked previously. As far as possible, the
EqA 2010 had to be interpreted consistently with EU law.7 There
was also an important ‘non-regression’ principle in the directives,
which meant that implementation of the directives could not result in
a diminution of rights already established in UK law.8
In recent years, the higher courts had started to seek guidance from
international conventions protecting equality, where important and
difficult points of principle were involved. The recitals to the
General Framework Directive and the Race Discrimination
Directives refer to various conventions to which all member states
are sig- natories, ie: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the
United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women; the International Convention on the
Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination; the United Nations
Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights; and the European Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. When interpreting the
meaning of the EU directives, it is therefore sometimes necessary to
consider the wider conventions on which they appear to be based. In

12.10

the JFS case,9 for example, in deciding that direct race
discrimination included discrimination against a person because of
the ethnicity of someone from whom they were descended, Lord
Mance noted that the International Convention on the Elimination of
all forms of Racial Discrimination ‘to which the United Kingdom is
party and to which Directive 2000/43/EC recites that it was intended
to give effect’ defined racial discrimination to include discrimination
based on ‘descent’.10 Similarly, in Grainger plc and others v
Nicholson,11 when deciding on the scope of a protected ‘belief’
under the EqA 2010, the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) looked
at cases decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR),
referring to the fact that the ECHR was cited as a source in the
General Framework Directive. Of course the ECHR must also be
considered as a result of the HRA 1998 which, so far, survives
Brexit.12
An introduction to the effect of Brexit and the ongoing
interpretation of the EqA 2010 in the light of retained EU law is set
out in chapter 3.

Working abroad
12.11

The EqA 2010 forms part of the law of England, Scotland and Wales.
Unlike the previous legislation, the EqA 2010 does not set out its
territorial scope. The problem arises where a worker works partly
or wholly outside Great Britain (GB). The tribunal will have to
decide by reference to the case-law whether there is a sufficiently
close link between the employment relationship and GB. According
to the EHRC Employment Code, relevant factors will be where the
employee lives and works, where the employer is established, where
tax is paid and what laws govern the employer relationship in other
respects.13 However, it is a bit more complicated than that. The
general principles in respect of unfair dismissal claims were set out
in the key case of Lawson v Serco Ltd and expanded in subsequent
cases.14 The Court of Appeal has now said that the same rules on
territorial jurisdiction apply to claims under the EqA 2010 as they do
to unfair dismissal claims.15

Who is covered?
Overview
12.12

The EqA 2010 is wider in scope than the Employment Rights Act
(ERA) 1996. It protects job applicants, apprentices, employees,
former employees, contract workers and those working on a contract
personally to do work.16 This latter category is sometimes known as
a ‘contract for services’. It is defined more widely than being
employed as an employee under a contract of employment, which is
required to claim unfair dismissal.17 One of the key differences is
that a mutual obligation to provide and do work is very important for
there to be a contract of employment, but is not necessary for there to
be a contract for services.18 There have been a number of cases
regarding what it means to be employed ‘under a contract personally
to do work’ in the EqA 2010. It is now established that this is
essentially the same as being a ‘worker’ for the purposes of the
Working Time Regulations 1998 etc (see paras 4.5–4.6). In other
words, it is not only necessary to be employed under a contract to
work personally, but the other party to the contract must not be a
client or customer of a business run by the claimant. In a few cases,
this has been described as being in a relationship of subordination
with the employer, as opposed to a genuinely independent provider
of services. However, ‘subordination’ is just one factor.19 In one
case brought by court interpreters, the Court of Appeal said it was
relevant to take into account that the individuals were only working
on an assignment by assignment basis as a factor indicating a lack of
subordination even during the period of the assignment.20 However,
working on intermittent assignments does not necessarily mean that a
person is not employed during the assignment. The situation of
interpreters working for courts on a case-by-case basis might be seen
as very different from, for example, special needs teachers employed
from time to time for particular pupils. The latter are more likely to
be in the necessary relationship of subordination for the duration of
their assignment.

12.13

12.14

12.15

12.16

Volunteer workers are not routinely covered,21 though they may be
able to claim in some circumstances, eg if in reality they are obliged
to work under a contract and they receive pay as opposed to
reimbursement of expenses.22 Unpaid interns may be covered by the
provisions on vocational training.23
Employment as a member of parliamentary staff and Crown
employment, eg employees in government departments, are
covered.24 So are members of the police force,25 and personal and
public office holders.26 Armed service personnel are partly covered,
subject to certain procedural requirements.27 There are exceptions
for age and disability, and discrimination against women or
transsexuals is allowed in certain respects if it is a proportionate
means of ensuring combat effectiveness.28 Depending on the facts,
church ministers may be protected as employees29 or personal office
holders. Discrimination is permitted in certain circumstances where
employment is for the purpose of an organised religion.30
Employment agencies must not discriminate in their provision of
services.31 Any person providing or making arrangements for the
provision of training facilities is also covered.32 This protects
trainees on work experience and work placement programmes.
Firms must not discriminate in relation to who is admitted to
partnership or how partners are treated.33 Barristers must not
discriminate against pupils or tenants, nor must anyone discriminate
in which barristers they instruct.34 Trade unions must not
discriminate in access to membership or against members, for
example, in the way they offer access to benefits or services.35

Contract workers
12.17

The protection of contract workers has become increasingly
important with the fragmentation of the labour market. Broadly
speaking, contract workers are those who are employed by one
organisation (‘the employer’) but supplied to do work for another
(‘the principal’) under a contract between the two.36 The contract
worker need only be employed by the employer in the wide sense

meant by the EqA 2010, ie on a contract personally to do work.
Precisely who can be considered as a contract worker depends on
the facts, but it will often cover workers supplied by an employment
agency to work for a different company,37 workers supplied by
concessionaires to work for department stores in specific
concessions, and workers employed in contracted-out services.38
The importance of the protection is that it means a worker who is
discriminated against by the principal, as opposed to his/her
employer, still has a legal claim.

Agency workers
12.18

12.19

Workers who are placed by agencies with end-users may want to
bring a discrimination case against the end-user. To do so, they must
either be employed by the end-user under a contract of employment
or contract personally to do work, or must be a ‘contract worker’
under EqA 2010 s41.39 The difficulty for an agency worker is that
there is rarely any contract at all between him/her and the end-user.40
The ‘contract worker’ route is usually more successful, although for
that to work, the worker must first be employed by the agency (and
then supplied to work for the end-user). Following the case of
Muschett,41 a general misapprehension seems to have arisen that
agency workers cannot bring discrimination claims. This is not
correct, and each case must be tested on its facts as to whether the
worker was in fact employed on a contract personally to do work by
the agency and if so, whether the remainder of the conditions
necessary to be a ‘contract worker’ apply.42
The worker’s claim may in addition – or alternatively – be against
the agency itself. It depends on who has carried out the alleged
discrimination. A claim can be made against the agency if the worker
was employed by the agency under a contract of employment or a
contract personally to do work. Or, if applicable, it may be easier to
claim under EqA 2010 s55, which makes employment serviceproviders responsible for discrimination in their services.

Protected characteristics

The EqA 2010 introduced a new piece of jargon: ‘protected
characteristic’. The following protected characteristics are covered
by the Act and must not form the basis for discrimination: age;
disability; gender reassignment; marital or civil partnership status;
race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation.43 Pregnancy and
maternity are also protected characteristics, though they are dealt
with slightly separately within the EqA 2010.44 All the protected
characteristics were covered by the previous legislation. More detail
on the meaning of each of these protected characteristics and linked
discrimination is in chapters 14 and 15.

12.20

Illegal contracts
In unfair dismissal law, an employee may be unable to bring a claim
if s/he knew about an illegality in his/her contract and actively
participated in it, eg accepting cash payments under the counter,
which were not recorded on his/her payslips.45 In a discrimination
case that is based on a statutory tort as opposed to the contract of
employment, illegality of the contract is less of a problem. As long
as facts giving rise to the claim are not so inextricably bound up with
the worker’s illegal conduct that allowing him/her to win his/her
claim would seem to condone the conduct, the worker can still bring
a claim.46 An employer’s defence of illegality would therefore
succeed only in quite extreme circumstances. For example:

12.21

•

In one case, a worker could potentially bring a sexual harassment claim, even though s/he
was employed on an illegal contract because her work permit had not yet come through.
The EAT commented that there is nothing intrinsic about being an employee that leads to
sexual harassment or freedom from it. The fact of employment may have given rise to a
practical opportunity for the acts to be committed, but that does not mean the harassment
was in any sense necessary, causative or inextricably linked with the employment itself.47

•

As another example, a woman was allowed to bring a pregnancy dismissal claim even
though she knew HM Customs & Revenue (HMRC) was being defrauded and she had
done nothing about it. Her acquiescence in the employer’s illegal performance of the
contract was in no way linked with her sex discrimination claim, which concerned a

dismissal for redundancy and incapability after the employer discovered she was
pregnant.48

On the other hand:
•

A rare case where the illegality defence succeeded was where an asylum-seeker,
unknown to his employer, was in breach of his conditions of leave to remain. He was not
allowed to claim race discrimination when he was dismissed. The illegal conduct was
completely down to the worker and amounted to a criminal offence.49

There is inevitably some subjectivity in considering whether the
illegality defence should succeed. The underlying test always
involves public policy and whether it is proportionate to deprive the
individual of the right to bring a case:50
•

In Hounga,51 a domestic servant from Nigeria was allowed to bring a race discrimination
claim regarding her dismissal even though she had participated with her employer in lying
on her visa application and entering the country illegally.52 The Supreme Court said there
were no public policy considerations in favour of the illegality defence barring a claim. Ms
Hounga did not profit from her unlawful conduct in entering the contract; she was awarded
compensation for injury to feelings due to her dismissal, in particular its abusive nature. Nor
was the integrity of the legal system compromised by apparently encouraging Ms Hounga
to enter an illegal contract. On the contrary. To allow the illegality defence would
encourage similar employers to enter illegal contracts. Even if there was any public policy
in barring the claim, it was outweighed by another public policy which was to protect
victims of trafficking.53

Prohibited actions
Overview
Unlike the law on unfair dismissal, the law on discrimination covers
all aspects of employment, including recruitment, promotion and
dismissal. Employers must not discriminate:

12.22

•

in the arrangements made for determining who should be offered employment;

•

in the terms on which employment is offered;

•

in refusing to offer employment; and

•

in access to opportunities for promotion, transfer, training or any other benefits, facilities or
services.54

Finally, it is prohibited to discriminate by:
•
12.23

12.24

12.25

dismissing a worker or subjecting him/her to a detriment.

Dismissal includes failing to renew a fixed-term contract and
constructive dismissal.55 The general principles of constructive
dismissal are set out in chapter 6. For a constructive dismissal to be
an act of discrimination, the repudiatory breach of contract over
which the employee resigns needs to be discrimination. If the
employee resigns over a number of incidents, only some of which are
discriminatory, the question is whether the discriminatory matters
sufficiently influenced the overall breach of contract. If so, it does
not matter if the last straw is not itself an act of discrimination.56
‘Subjecting’ the worker to ‘any other detriment’ basically means
putting the worker at a disadvantage.57 However, a worker is
unlikely to win a discrimination case on a trivial matter. The worker
must show that ‘by reason of the act or acts complained of a
reasonable worker would or might take the view that s/he had
thereby been disadvantaged in the circumstances in which s/he had
thereafter to work’. It could include a disciplinary warning,
demotion, or offensive remarks, though the latter is likely to be
covered by the specific offence of harassment.58 If a worker
complains about the content of an advertisement which has
apparently excluded him/her from getting a job, s/he does need to
have a genuine interest in accepting the job if offered. Otherwise it
will not be a disadvantage.59 An unjustified sense of grievance
cannot amount to a detriment, but there need not be any physical or
economic consequences. The test is whether the worker’s opinion
that the treatment was to his/her detriment is a reasonable one to
hold.60
Sex discrimination in pay and other contract terms is generally
dealt with under separate rules which previously existed in similar
form under the EqPA 1970.61 The rules are now in EqA 2010 Part 5
(employment) Chapter 3 (equality of terms). Chapter 5 of this book

provides more detail on this and para 5.3 discusses the difficult
borderline between sex discrimination and equal pay cases.

Discrimination against former employees
12.26

Direct or indirect discrimination against a former employee taking
place after his/her job has ended is covered, provided the
discrimination arises out of and is closely connected with the former
employment relationship.62 Examples could be giving a
discriminatory reference, refusal to return the worker’s property, or
conducting a post-dismissal appeal in a discriminatory way.
Harassment and failure to make reasonable adjustments in respect of
a former employee are also prohibited.63 Post-termination
victimisation is also covered, even though the EqA 2010 is poorly
drafted on this point.64 This is important because workers often
complain of difficulties getting a fair reference after they have left
because they have brought a discrimination case.

Vicarious liability
12.27

12.28

Employers are liable for the discriminatory acts of workers, which
are carried out in the course of their employment, regardless of
whether they knew or approved those acts,65 unless they took all
reasonable preventative steps.66 It is no use taking remedial steps
after the discrimination happens, eg by sacking a manager who has
discriminated against the worker. To avoid liability for the original
discrimination, the employer must have taken steps to prevent such
discrimination happening in the first place. There is little case-law
on how much an employer needs to do preventatively to be able to
use this defence, but it will involve more than simply having a paper
‘equal opportunities’ policy. The real question is likely to be
whether such a policy is effectively implemented, eg by proper
training, refreshers and monitoring.
The scope of employers’ liability is a particularly important issue
in harassment claims. This is partly because harassment is often
carried out by work colleagues and not approved of by management

12.29

12.30

at all. Also, harassment often occurs outside ‘the course of
employment’, eg at social meetings unrelated to work. Issues then
arise as to whether incidents occurring at leaving drinks, Christmas
parties, work trips etc are ‘in the course of employment’. This is
discussed further in the section on harassment.67
Also, ‘principals’ are liable for any action done by their agents
with their authority.68 Again this applies whether or not the action
was done with the principal’s knowledge or approval.69 It is not
necessary that the agent was given authority to discriminate. It is
enough that s/he was given authority to do a particular act, which
could be done in a lawful or in a discriminatory way.70 For example,
if an agent had authority to terminate an employee’s contract, the
employer (the principal) would be responsible if the agent did so on
a discriminatory basis.
It can be difficult to know whether a person actually is an agent
because they are not always called an agent at the time. This is a
subject dealt with under the general common law, which is itself
complex, and until recently, there have been few employment cases
on the matter.71 In one case, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police was liable for any discrimination against one of his civilian
employees carried by an officer of a different police force who was
responsible for line managing her, the officer acting as an agent for
the commissioner.72 Another example of the kind of situation which
might be covered would be where an external consultant is taken on
to deal with a company’s accounts, using the company’s notepaper
when dealing with outside customers and authorised to give
instructions to staff in the accounts department. Such a consultant
would probably be an agent and, if s/he made racist remarks to the
company’s bookkeeper while doing this work, the company would be
liable unless it had taken all reasonable preventative steps.
Arguably, a worker’s employer is also vicariously liable for
discrimination against the worker carried out by an agency worker
who is exercising authority or controlled by the employer.73 On the
other hand, where a worker is discriminated against by the employee
of a contractor engaged by his/her employer, the situation is more

12.31

difficult. The contractor’s employee is unlikely to be an agent for the
worker’s employer (the ‘principal’) as his/her authority to take
actions will mainly derive from his/her employment contract with the
contractor and s/he is unlikely to be authorised by the principal to act
on its behalf towards third parties.74
There are statutory provisions on where employers’ liability lies
in the case of the police.75

Liability of individual discriminators
12.32

In a situation where an employer is liable for discriminatory actions
carried out by its agents or by workers who it employs, the
individual agent or worker is also legally liable for his/her actions.76
It makes no difference if the employer can avoid liability because it
had taken all reasonable preventative steps.77 However, the
individual is not legally responsible for his/her discriminatory
actions if s/he had reasonably relied on a statement by the employer
or principal that such actions would not be discriminatory.78

Aiding discrimination
12.33

It is unlawful knowingly to help someone else discriminate against or
harass a worker.79 ‘Aiding’ involves something more than merely
tolerating an environment in which discrimination can occur.80 A
person who aids someone do a discriminatory action is treated as if
s/he has done that action him/herself. It is not unlawful if the helper
reasonably relied on a statement that the action for which the help
was given was not unlawful discrimination. It is a criminal offence
knowingly or recklessly to make such a statement.81

Public sector equality duty
Background
12.34

It is worth considering the history of the public sector equality duty
(PSED), to see how the specific duties have been weakened over
time in England, though not in Scotland and Wales. The first public

sector duty was introduced by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act
2000. This resulted from the MacPherson Report following the
Stephen Lawrence inquiry. Under Race Relations Act 1976 s71, a
positive duty was placed on a public authority in carrying out its
functions to have:
… due regard to the need–
(a) to eliminate unlawful race discrimination; and
(b) to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different
racial groups.

12.35

This included the authority’s employment functions. Specific duties
for public authorities were set out in regulations.82 Authorities were
required to publish a Race Equality Scheme and to review their list
of functions, policies and proposed policies for relevance to the
general statutory duty every three years. Monitoring was required of
existing staff, job applicants and staff applications for training and
promotion. Authorities with 150 or more full-time staff were also
required to monitor disciplinaries, grievances, performance
appraisals, training and leavers. Results had to be published
annually.
From 6 April 2007, a similar gender equality duty came into effect
under Sex Discrimination Act 1975 s76A. This covered pay as well
as other areas of employment. The disability equality duty came into
effect on 5 December 2006. As with the race and gender duties,
many public authorities were subject to specific duties which
included publishing a Disability Equality Scheme and revising the
scheme every three years. Disabled people were required to be
involved in all aspects of the development of the scheme.

The public sector equality duty under the Equality Act
2010
Overview
12.36

On 5 April 2011, a new PSED came into force in England, Scotland
and Wales replacing the previous race, gender and disability duties.

12.37

The duty covers the protected characteristics of age; disability;
gender reassignment; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or
belief; sex; and sexual orientation. The duty applies to the public
authorities set out in EqA 2010 Sch 19 and includes government
departments, local government, the police, the NHS and various
educational bodies.83 Non-public authorities which nevertheless
exercise a public function must comply with the duty when exercising
that function.84 A public function is a function which is considered a
function of a public nature for the purposes of the HRA 1998.85
The general duty is set out in EqA 2010 s149, which states:
(1) A public authority must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to the need to–
(a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is
prohibited by or under this Act;
(b) advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic and persons who do not share it;
(c) foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic
and persons who do not share it.

12.38

12.39

The general duty under EqA 2010 is very similar to the previous
general duties, with one important improvement. It talks about the
need to ‘advance’ equality of opportunity, not merely to ‘promote’ it
as in the previous duties. In particular, this involves having due
regard to the need to remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by
people who share a relevant protected characteristic; to take steps to
meet the different needs of people who share a relevant protected
characteristic compared with others; and to encourage those who
share a relevant protected characteristic to participate in activities
where their participation is disproportionately low.86 In
endeavouring to foster good relations, authorities should particularly
have regard to the need to tackle prejudice and promote
understanding.87
It is important to note that this duty goes further than simply
avoiding unlawful discrimination. It contains positive obligations to
‘advance equality of opportunity’. Compliance with the duty may

12.40

12.41

involve treating some people more favourably than others, but not in
a way which is otherwise prohibited by the Act.88
In addition to the general duty, England (plus non-devolved bodies
in Scotland and Wales), Wales and Scotland each have their own
specific duties. The Welsh Assembly has produced fairly
progressive specific duties which involve requirements for
producing and regularly reviewing written equality objectives;
comprehensive monitoring; carrying out and publishing equality
impact assessments (EIAs) on proposed policies and practices, and
considering whether to make compliance with the general duty part
of the award criteria on procurement.89 The Scottish Parliament has
also produced a progressive set of specific duties which include
authorities involving people with the relevant protected
characteristics when preparing equality objectives, taking into
account any impact assessments when developing new policies,
monitoring recruitment retention and development of employees and
provisions on recruitment.90 The English specific duties91 are
weaker than their Scottish and Welsh equivalents, and are also less
specific than the race, gender and disability special duties under the
previous legislation. Every four years, public authorities must
prepare and publish one or more ‘specific and measurable’ equality
objectives, which they think they should achieve in order to meet the
EqA 2010 s149 general duty. Authorities must also publish annual
information to demonstrate their compliance with the section 149
general duty. Although the English duties seem very vague, the
general duty in section 149 is strongly worded. Arguably a fair
amount of ‘information’ would need to be published under section
149 to ‘demonstrate’ an authority’s compliance with that duty across
its functions.
The EHRC has published ‘technical guidance’ on the PSED in
each of England, Scotland and Wales. The EHRC had originally
planned to produce statutory codes, but the government said it would
not lay these before parliament. The EHRC has instead produced the
text as non-statutory ‘technical guidance’. The EHRC says this
guidance will still be ‘a formal, authoritative and comprehensive

legal interpretation of the duty’. There are separate guides for
England, Scotland and Wales.92 The EHRC also produced guidance
on Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the equality duty.93
Enforcement
12.42

12.43

Individuals cannot bring private law claims against public
authorities for failing to comply with the PSED.94 However, the
EHRC95 – or indeed other interested individuals or groups of
individuals – can bring a judicial review against an authority which
has breached the general duty. The EHRC also has power to conduct
assessments and to issue compliance notices.96 The EHRC website
contains updates from its monitoring of the duties.97
In terms of individual discrimination cases, an employer’s failure
to follow its public sector duty, including any failure to carry out an
EIA before introducing a policy under challenge, may be particularly
relevant to whether it can justify indirect discrimination or whether it
is reasonable to make an adjustment for a disabled worker.98
Equality impact assessments

12.44

12.45

Possibly the most effective aspect of the public sector duties has
been the development of EIAs. Apart from in the Welsh and Scottish
specific duties, there is no explicit requirement under the old or new
legislation to carry out EIAs. However, it follows on logically from
the nature of the general duty. If an authority is going to be able to
have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination in the
exercise of all its functions, one would think it needs to assess the
impact of its proposed plans in advance. Ultimately it will be for the
courts to decide whether an authority has gathered sufficient
information in advance and has applied its mind to the impact of its
proposals.
There have been a number of very interesting judicial review
cases, where the courts have quashed decisions made by public
authorities because they did not have ‘due regard’ to the need to
promote equality of opportunity.99 The cases have generally been in
non-employment scenarios. They indicate that, whether or not there

12.46

12.47

is a formal EIA, there cannot be ‘due regard’ if the decision-makers
have not fully informed themselves of the facts, which entails
collecting and considering sufficient information regarding the
people directly and indirectly affected by the proposed policy and
understanding the nature of any likely impact. The cases stress that
advance consideration is required – not an assessment after the event
to justify a concluded decision. Further, making assumptions before
actually carrying out an impact assessment that one is unnecessary
because there is no obvious evidence of a discriminatory impact,
puts the cart before the horse.100
The public sector equality duty is a continuing duty and must be
fulfilled before and at the time when a particular policy is being
considered. It must be exercised with rigour and an open mind, not as
a tick-box exercise. If the necessary information is not available,
there is a duty to acquire it, which might involve further consultation
with appropriate groups.101
In the employment field, it would seem good practice to carry out
an EIA as a preliminary step before introducing new policies on
matters such as sickness and attendance; holidays; customer
complaints procedures; access to training; operation of grievance
procedures; new terms and conditions; restructuring; and pension
proposals. Unions are in a good position to ask employers for EIAs
of proposed actions, eg cuts and redundancies, in terms of the impact
on the service as well as on the workforce.

Chapter 13: Key points
•

The definitions of ‘direct discrimination’, ‘indirect discrimination’,
‘victimisation’ and ‘harassment’ apply to all the ‘protected
characteristics’ under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010 except
pregnancy and maternity which have their own rules.

Direct discrimination
•
•

•

Direct discrimination is less favourable treatment because of a
protected characteristic.
It includes discrimination because of the protected
characteristic of someone else, eg someone with whom the
worker is associated. It also includes discrimination where the
worker is wrongly perceived to have a particular protected
characteristic.
There is no justification defence to direct discrimination except
for direct age discrimination.

General guide to useful evidence
•

•
•
•

An actual comparator without the relevant protected
characteristic who has been treated better in similar
circumstances.
Evidence discrediting the employer’s likely explanation of
events.
Indications of prejudice by the relevant decision-makers (not
legally essential, but can strengthen the case).
Statistics as to the position and treatment of workers generally
within the workplace by reference to the relevant protected
characteristics.

Indirect discrimination

•

•

•
•

Indirect discrimination is where the employer applies a
provision, criterion or practice (PCP) which puts the worker at
a disadvantage and puts others with the same protected
characteristic at a particular disadvantage.
Whether there is a particular disadvantage is usually
considered within an appropriate ‘pool’, ie a relevant section of
the community.
Statistics or other evidence can be used to prove particular
disadvantage.
It is not indirect discrimination if the employer can prove the
PCP was objectively justified, ie a proportionate means of
achieving a legitimate aim.

General guide to useful evidence
•

•

Statistics or other evidence showing people with the same
relevant protected characteristic as the worker would tend to
be disadvantaged by the particular PCP.
Evidence showing the worker is disadvantaged by the PCP.

Victimisation
•

•

It is victimisation to subject a worker to a detriment because
s/he has done a ‘protected act’, eg complained about
discrimination in some way.
It does not matter if the worker was wrong in believing there
was discrimination, as long as the complaint was made in
good faith.

General guide to useful evidence
•
•

Evidence that the worker has done the protected act and that
the employer was upset about it.
Evidence showing the worker was treated better before doing
the protected act or that another worker who has not done a
protected act has been treated better in similar circumstances.

Harassment
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Harassment is unwanted conduct related to a protected
characteristic with the purpose or effect of violating a worker’s
dignity or creating an intimidating, degrading, humiliating or
hostile environment.
A worker can be harassed by conduct directed at someone
else. The harassment need not relate to the worker’s own
protected characteristics.
The conduct must be unwanted. The fact that the worker has
put up with harassment for a long time does not mean it is not
unwanted.
It is also unlawful harassment to subject a worker to unwanted
conduct of a sexual nature or to treat him/her less favourably
because s/he rejected or submitted to sexual harassment.
If the harasser or management treat the worker less
favourably because s/he complains about harassment, this
may be further harassment or direct discrimination or
victimisation if what is done meets those definitions.
An employer will be responsible for any direct discrimination in
his/her response to a worker’s complaint about harassment by
third parties, eg members of the public. An employer’s inaction
may also amount to harassment in itself.
A failure by the employer to investigate a complaint of
harassment may well be fundamental breach of contract, so
that the worker can resign and claim constructive dismissal.1
Civil or criminal claims regarding harassment by the public may
also be possible, but are difficult and expensive.

General guide to useful evidence
•

Evidence proving that the harassment occurred, eg visits to a
GP, people the worker told at the time, first-hand witnesses,
text messages or emails, worker’s diary, groundless
disciplinary action brought by the harasser against the worker.

•

Evidence of any efforts to inform management and the
response.
Evidence showing the harassment was unwanted.
Evidence of any substantial preventative measures taken by
the employer, eg equal opportunities training of staff.

•
•

Other
•

•

•

•
•

•

It is unlawful to instruct, cause or induce discrimination. If
subjected to a detriment as a result, either the worker given
the instruction or the potential ‘victim’ of the discrimination can
bring a claim.
Multiple discrimination claims can be brought where more than
one protected characteristic is involved, but workers should
think very carefully about whether there is sufficient evidence in
each case. A focused case with strong evidence is better than
a large number of vague allegations.
Where evidence suggests discrimination is because of two
combined protected characteristics, a claim can be made
separately based on each protected characteristic individually.
Claims based on more than one protected characteristic
should have specific evidence that each is involved.
There are numerous exceptions where discrimination is
allowed, including for ‘occupational requirements’ and positive
action. There are strict conditions for these.
More detail on each aspect of this chapter is set out in respect
of the separate protected characteristics in chapters 14 and
15.

Overview
13.1

The following types of discrimination apply to all the protected
characteristics2 under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010 except pregnancy
and maternity which have their own rules:

13.2

•

direct discrimination;

•

indirect discrimination;

•

victimisation;

•

harassment.

In addition, there is the concept of instructing, causing or inducing
discrimination, which has some overlap with victimisation and
direct discrimination. There are two further definitions of
discrimination applicable to disability, which are explained in
chapter 15: discrimination arising from disability; and failure to
make reasonable adjustments. The EqA 2010 refers to all these as
‘prohibited conduct’.
One feature of the EqA 2010 compared with the previous legislation
is that it tends to use the word ‘discrimination’ to refer to direct
discrimination and indirect discrimination, but excluding
victimisation. Each type of discrimination has a precise legal
meaning, which is set out below. Note that ‘institutional racism’ is
not a legal concept and it is not helpful to refer to it.3 In summary, the
meaning of each form of discrimination is as follows:
1) Direct discrimination is where one worker is treated differently from another because of
a protected characteristic. Where the direct discrimination is because of the worker’s own
protected characteristic, it is usually helpful to ask the question: ‘Had this worker been of a
different race/sex/religion/age etc, would the employer have treated him/her the same
way?’
If different requirements are imposed on workers according to their
race/sex/religion/age etc, this is direct discrimination. For example: If an employer required
all male workers to be more than six feet tall and all female workers to be more than five
feet tall, a male job applicant of five feet five inches, who was therefore refused a job,
would suffer direct discrimination.
There is no justification defence to direct discrimination (except for direct age
discrimination). There are exceptions for occupational requirements and for positive action
(see below).
2) Indirect discrimination is where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice
(PCP) is applied, which puts or would put workers who share a particular protected
characteristic at a disadvantage compared with others who do not have that protected

characteristic. For example: An employer requires all workers to be more than six feet tall.
Women would be at a disadvantage compared with men when applying for a job. A female
job applicant below six feet would suffer indirect discrimination.
PCPs which can be objectively justified are not unlawful indirect discrimination.
3) Victimisation is where a worker is treated badly because s/he has previously complained
of discrimination, given evidence for another worker in a discrimination case, or done any
other ‘protected act’. For example: An employer sacks a worker because s/he complained
of race discrimination.
The employer has a defence if the worker made a false allegation and did not act in
good faith.
4) Harassment is unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic which has the
purpose or effect of violating the worker’s dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile,
degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.

This chapter sets out the general principles in relation to each of
these definitions. It is important to read this chapter first – then for
further detail in relation to their application to particular protected
characteristics, see also chapter 14. European Union (EU) legislation
and case-law is heavily influential in the discrimination field. For
the consequences of Brexit, see chapter 3.

Direct discrimination
Overview
13.3

Direct discrimination is the most obvious form of discrimination. It
entails less favourable treatment because of any of these protected
characteristics: age; disability; gender reassignment; marital or civil
partnership status; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual
orientation.4 Segregating a person on racial grounds is regarded as
less favourable treatment.5 It is not unlawful under the EqA 2010 to
treat someone less favourably because they are not married or not a
civil partner.6 It is permitted to treat a woman more favourably than a
man in connection with pregnancy or childbirth.7 It is also permitted
to treat disabled workers more favourably because of their
disability.8 With limited exceptions, unfavourable treatment of

13.4

women due to pregnancy or maternity is treated under its own rules
in EqA 2010 s18.9
The definition of direct discrimination in EqA 2010 s13 states:
(1) A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected
characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others.

13.5

13.6

13.7

13.8

The definition in previous legislation referred to less favourable
treatment ‘on grounds of’ the protected characteristic in question, as
opposed to ‘because of’. The EqA 2010 replaced the phrase ‘on
grounds of’ with ‘because of’ purely out of a desire to use plain
English. It does not appear to have changed the meaning of the
definition as developed by the case-law over a long period.
Direct discrimination is best thought of in terms of comparative
treatment. Comparisons between a worker with a particular
protected characteristic and one without that protected characteristic
must be made where there is no material difference between the
circumstances relating to each case.10 This is so that the comparison
is significant. A worker claiming race discrimination, for example,
will usually have a stronger case if s/he can point to an actual person
of a different race who was treated more favourably in similar
circumstances. However, it is not essential to find an actual
comparator if it can be shown that the employer ‘would have treated’
someone of a different race more favourably. This is called a
‘hypothetical comparator’.
A possible example of direct sex discrimination is where an
employer does not appoint a woman with appropriate qualifications
and experience for a job. If the woman was not appointed because
she was a woman, then direct discrimination has occurred. This is so
regardless of whether an actual man with similar or lesser
qualifications and experience has applied and been appointed,
although the woman would find it harder to prove her case if there
was no actual comparable man.11
Although it is necessary under the definition of direct
discrimination for the tribunal to find that the employer has treated
the worker less favourably than s/he has treated or would treat a

comparator, sometimes this question can only be answered by first
considering why the worker has been treated as s/he has.12 For
example, if the evidence suggests that the reason why a female
worker has been treated unfavourably is because of her sex, it
usually follows that the employer would have treated a hypothetical
male comparator better.13
In certain cases it is impossible to make a literal comparison with
how someone of the opposite sex would be treated, eg unfavourable
treatment of pregnant women14 or cases concerning dress and
appearance. Where women are not allowed to wear trousers or men
are required to cut their hair, there is no discrimination if workers of
the opposite sex have been required to meet comparable or
equivalent standards of smartness.15 So far, the Human Rights Act
(HRA) 1998 does not appear to have helped on this issue.16
The protected characteristic need not be the only basis for the
employer’s actions. It is enough if the protected characteristic was
‘an important factor’ or ‘had a significant influence on the
outcome’.17 For example, if an employer failed to recruit a black job
applicant partly because she was black and partly because she was
inexperienced, that would still be direct race discrimination.

Perception and association
Overview
The definition of direct discrimination refers to less favourable
treatment of a worker because of ‘a’ protected characteristic. This
wording means it need not be because of the worker’s own protected
characteristic. Unlawful direct discrimination should therefore
include less favourable treatment:

13.11

•

because of the protected characteristic of someone with whom the worker is associated,
eg a friend or relative – this is known as discrimination by association;

•

because of the protected characteristic of people who the worker does not even know, eg
potential users, customers or clients;

•

because the employer wrongly perceives the worker to have a protected characteristic –
this is often known as discrimination by perception.

13.12

This type of discrimination does not appear to apply to marriage and
civil partnership,18 or pregnancy19 and maternity. Where there is
discrimination because of perception or association in relation to
pregnancy, it may be possible to bring a direct sex discrimination
claim.
Discrimination by association

13.13

As the definition of direct discrimination is less favourable treatment
because of ‘a’ protected characteristic, it includes discrimination
against a worker because of someone else’s protected characteristic.
This might be someone with whom the worker is associated, such as
a friend or relative. For example, an employer refuses to recruit a
Christian worker because she has Muslim friends. The phrase
‘discrimination by association’ is not spelled out in the EqA 2010,
and it is best avoided, even though it is referred to in the EHRC
Employment Code at paras 3.18–3.19. The concept of ‘association’
is more limited than the actual wording of the EqA 2010 (as the next
paragraph illustrates) and leads to difficult and irrelevant questions
such as what ‘associated’ means.
Discrimination because of the protected characteristic of
people not associated with the claimant

13.14

The EHRC Employment Code gives the example of a worker treated
less favourably because s/he campaigned on behalf of others with a
particular protected characteristic, eg a non-disabled worker is not
shortlisted for an internal job because s/he has helped set up an
informal staff network for disabled workers.20 Another example
where discrimination against a worker may be because of the
protected characteristic of someone else is where a worker is
dismissed because s/he refused to carry out a discriminatory
instruction to exclude black or Asian customers.21 These examples
are direct discrimination as they involve less favourable treatment
‘because of disability’ or ‘because of race’, albeit not the disability
or race of the worker who is discriminated against. In many

situations of this kind, the law on victimisation may more obviously
apply, provided a ‘protected act’ can be identified (see para 13.58).
Discrimination by perception
Although the phrase ‘discrimination by perception’ is also not
spelled out in the EqA 2010, again it is thought to be covered
because of the way the definition of direct discrimination is worded.
The EHRC Employment Code refers to it explicitly at para 3.21.
Discrimination by perception could occur, for example, where an
employer treats a worker less favourably because of a wrong
assumption that the worker is of a certain age, nationality or religion,
or that s/he is gay.

13.15

The employer’s state of mind
Employers often tell the employment tribunal (ET) that they are not
personally prejudiced and insist that they acted with the best of
intentions in everything they did. However true, this is irrelevant.22
What counts is what the employer does, not his/her motives.
The key question is ‘the reason why’ the employer treated the
worker in the way s/he did. Was it because of a protected
characteristic or for some other reason? If the employer did treat the
worker less favourably because of a protected characteristic, the
employer’s motive for doing so is irrelevant. There cannot be a
‘good’ motive for discriminating. For example, if an employer treats
a black worker worse than s/he would treat a white worker, this is
direct race discrimination in any of the following situations:

13.16

13.17

•

the employer intended to treat the black worker worse out of personal racial prejudice or
malice;

•

the employer intended to treat the black worker worse, but out of a non-malicious or even
benevolent motive;

•

the employer in fact treated the black worker worse but without realising it, ie
unconscious discrimination;

•

the employer was acting on stereotyped assumptions about members of the relevant racial
group.

The House of Lords made a very important statement about
stereotyping in the Roma Rights Centre23 case:
The object of the legislation is to ensure that each person is treated as an individual and not
assumed to be like other members of the group, whether or not most members of the group
do have such characteristics. If a person acts on racial grounds, the reason why he does so
is irrelevant. The person may be acting on belief or assumptions about members of the sex
or racial group involved which are often true and which if true would provide a good reason
for the less favourable treatment in question, but what may be true of a group may not be
true of a significant number of individuals within that group.
13.18

13.19

13.20

A striking example of the employer’s motive being irrelevant was a
case where Amnesty International was found guilty of direct race
discrimination, even though its motives were apparently benign.24
Amnesty decided not to promote a worker of Sudanese origin to the
position of researcher for Sudan because of the serious political and
ethnic tensions between the North and South of that country. It felt
that she would not be seen as impartial because of her ethnic origin,
which would compromise Amnesty’s reputation for neutrality and
also endanger her own safety when travelling there. Nevertheless,
the decision was unlawful.
Other examples of direct race discrimination where the employer
was not personally prejudiced are: where a head teacher refused to
appoint a teacher because the pupils wished to be taught English by
someone of English national origin, and where a Pakistani worker
was not re-employed because the employer feared industrial unrest
among fellow Pakistani workers resulting from an earlier incident
between him and a white foreman.25 These examples concern direct
race discrimination, but the principle is the same regarding all the
protected characteristics.
There is a long-established ‘but for’ test, which usually helps to
identify direct discrimination.26 The question is whether the worker,
but for his/her race or sex or other protected characteristic, would
have been treated differently by the employer. For example, if a
well-qualified woman fails in her job application, the question is
whether the employer would have recruited her if she was a man

13.21

13.22

13.23

with the same qualifications. The advantage of this test is that it
focuses on actions not motives and the ET need not try to assess the
employer’s state of mind.
Unfortunately, the beautifully clear ‘but for’ test has been
questioned in many cases in recent years, which prefer to look at ‘the
reason why’ the employer has acted as s/he has.27 This alternative
test rather begs the question, and does not provide much help in
practice for analysing evidence. Even worse, it potentially misleads
advisers and tribunals into wrongly looking for conscious racial etc
motives. Arguably, the attack on the ‘but for’ test arises from a
distortion or extension of its formulation. The original test is
expressed in the active tense, ie ‘but for the worker’s protected
characteristic, would the employer have treated him/her the same
way?’ This formulation should answer any objections that it goes too
far. However, in several of the cases where it has been criticised, it
has effectively been looked at passively, ie ‘but for the worker’s
protected characteristic, would the same thing have happened to
him/her?’ This latter formulation is incorrect because factors other
than the employer’s discriminatory reason could affect the outcome.
It is also interesting that many of the original cases which attacked
the ‘but for’ test concerned either victimisation (under its pre-EqA
2010 definition, which had a different legal definition to direct
discrimination), or the treatment of women in relation to sexual
relationships at work (which may be better suited to the definition of
harassment).28 A full discussion of the pros and cons of the ‘but for’
test and the extent to which it is still useful is beyond the scope of
this book. However, in the vast majority of cases, the ‘but for’ test
(correctly formulated), is still a safe way of identifying direct
discrimination.
Unconscious discrimination is hard to prove, but it is a concept
which the law recognises. The cases tend to have been concerned
with race discrimination, but again, the same principles apply to
discrimination because of any of the protected characteristics. The
Court of Appeal has talked about the possibility of ‘a conscious or
unconscious racial attitude which involves stereotyped assumptions

about members of that [racial] group’.29 The most explicit and
enlightened guidance on this point was given by the House of Lords
in Nagarajan v London Regional Transport.30 Although the case
concerned victimisation, the guidance was intended also to apply to
direct discrimination:
All human beings have preconceptions, beliefs, attitudes and prejudices on many subjects.
It is part of our make-up. Moreover, we do not always recognise our own prejudices. Many
people are unable, or unwilling, to admit even to themselves that actions of theirs may be
racially motivated. An employer may genuinely believe that the reason why he rejected an
applicant had nothing to do with the applicant’s race. After careful and thorough
investigation of the claim, members of an employment tribunal may decide that the proper
inference to be drawn from the evidence is that, whether the employer realised it at the
time or not, race was the reason why he acted as he did … Members of racial groups need
protection from conduct driven by unrecognised prejudice as much as from conscious and
deliberate discrimination.

13.24

Unfortunately, some ETs have failed in the past to understand that
much discrimination occurs due to unconscious stereotyping, for
example, unconsciously undervaluing the performance or capability
of a black worker. ETs may find that racial discrimination has not
occurred because they believe in the ‘honesty’ of the employers’
witnesses. Yet a manager who honestly believes a black worker is
not fit for promotion may nevertheless have reached a different
‘honest’ view of a white worker, when confronted with the same
objective evidence.31 In some cases, it may be worth explicitly
drawing the above passage to the ET’s attention at the outset of a
hearing.
Another issue which can arise is where the reason why the
decision-maker treats the worker as s/he does is not because of any
particular protected characteristic, but because the decision-maker is
innocently acting on tainted information. In such a case, the decisionmaker has not committed direct discrimination in his/her own
actions, although the person supplying the tainted information may
have done so.32 For example, a managing director dismisses a
worker because he has received a poor appraisal from the worker’s

line manager. Unknown to the managing director, the line manager
has assessed the worker less favourably because of the worker’s
age. The discriminatory action is the giving of the appraisal by the
line manager, not the dismissal by the managing director. If the
appraisal directly led to the lost job, compensation might well
include loss of earnings arising from the dismissal. However, it is
important from the point of view of evidence and time limits to make
the correct analysis.

Defences to direct discrimination
13.25

13.26

With the exception of direct age discrimination, an employer is
unable to argue that direct discrimination was justified. Once an
employer has treated a worker less favourably because of a
protected characteristic, there cannot be a good reason for doing so.
In specified circumstances, direct discrimination is permitted, eg
where an ‘occupational requirement’ exception applies or ‘positive
action’ is allowed. These exceptions are set out partly below (from
para 13.131) and partly in chapter 14. Direct age discrimination is
also allowed if the employer can justify it by showing the less
favourable treatment was a proportionate means of achieving a
legitimate aim.33 More detail of this defence is at para 14.10
onwards.

Indirect discrimination
Overview
13.27

13.28

Indirect discrimination is a more difficult concept for practitioners
and tribunals alike. The definition of indirect discrimination was
introduced in the Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976, as it was
recognised that the law against direct discrimination did not go far
enough to eliminate institutionalised disadvantage in the workplace.
The great difficulty of indirect discrimination is that it is not always
easy to detect, and advisers need to be particularly alert.
Indirect discrimination occurs where there is apparently equal
treatment of all workers, but the effect of certain requirements and

13.29

practices imposed by the employer puts workers with a certain
protected characteristic at a particular disadvantage. For example, a
requirement that all job applicants speak fluent English, while
applied equally to everyone, would disproportionately bar people
born in non-English-speaking countries from employment.
It may be important to stress to tribunals that the prohibition on
indirect discrimination does not reduce standards or entail any kind
of reverse discrimination. This is a common misconception. If a
discriminatory requirement or practice can be justified, then it is not
unlawful. The law simply prohibits unjustifiable requirements and
practices which have a discriminatory effect.

The definition
Equality Act 2010 s19
13.30

Historically, the definition of indirect discrimination has been
through a number of changes. The earlier case-law is based on the
older definitions, so it is important to understand this. The changes in
the definition have made a difference in what needs to be proved.
The definition of indirect discrimination is now contained in EqA
2010 s19 and reads as follows:
(1) A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if A applies to B a provision, criterion or
practice which is discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected characteristic of B’s.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a provision, criterion or practice is discriminatory in
relation to a relevant protected characteristic of B’s if–
(a) A applies, or would apply, it to persons with whom B does not share the characteristic,
(b) it puts, or would put, persons with whom B shares the characteristic at a particular
disadvantage when compared with persons with whom B does not share it,
(c) it puts, or would put, B at that disadvantage, and
(d) A cannot show it to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.

The relevant protected characteristics are: age; disability; gender
reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; race; religion or belief;
sex; and sexual orientation.34
Identifying the provision, criterion or practice

13.31

13.32

The first stage in the definition is that the employer must have
applied a ‘provision, criterion or practice’ (PCP) to the worker. A
PCP covers more situations than the original wording of indirect
discrimination, which referred to discriminatory ‘requirements and
conditions’. Almost anything done by an employer will count as a
PCP, eg mandatory or preferred selection criteria for jobs, promotion
or redundancy; conditions for training or overtime opportunities;
rules about when holidays can be taken; imposition of certain hours
or working patterns. Examples of PCPs relevant to different
protected characteristics are given in chapter 14 and appendix B.
See also paras 15.45–15.46 concerning disability reasonable
adjustments for a further discussion of what PCP means.
It is not always easy to identify which is the relevant PCP imposed
by the employer. Formulating the PCP wrongly can make the
difference between winning and losing a case.
Establishing group disadvantage
1)

13.33

13.34

The pool

The PCP must be one which ‘puts, or would put’ people with whom
the worker shares the relevant protected characteristic at a particular
disadvantage when compared with those who do not share that
characteristic. For example, if the worker is a woman, the PCP
would put women at a particular disadvantage compared with men.
The comparison of the impact of the PCP must be made where there
is no material difference between the circumstances relating to those
with and without the relevant protected characteristic.35
The question is, within what section of the community should the
comparison be made?36 This is known as a ‘pool’. Should the effect
of the disadvantage be measured on those with and without the
relevant protected characteristic in the general workforce? Or should
it be measured in society generally? Or only among those in a
particular town or a specific workplace or with appropriate
qualifications?37 The appropriate ‘pool’ will depend on the facts of
each case and which section of the public is likely to be affected by
the requirement.38 It will depend on the type of discrimination

13.35

involved, as well as what evidence is available.39 In general, the
pool should consist of the group which the PCP affects or would
affect, either positively or negatively.40 The pool has to test suitably
the discrimination complained of. There is no point bringing into the
equation people who have no interest in the advantage or
disadvantage in question.41 For example, in one case, teachers who
had returned to teaching after retirement while in receipt of a pension
could only acquire further pensionable service if they returned on a
full-time rather than a part-time basis. The correct pool for assessing
whether this rule had disparate impact on women was retired
teachers, not all teachers.42 Taking another example, in recruitment
cases the appropriate pool will often be those who, apart from the
discriminatory requirement, have the required qualifications for the
post.43
The outcome of the comparison exercise may well vary according
to the pool chosen. The ET’s selection of the appropriate pool is a
matter for its discretion.44 The important point is not to define the
pool so narrowly that it is misleading because it incorporates
discrimination. For example, in one case45 only those who had been
resident in the EU were eligible for lower college fees. It would
have been misleading to choose as a pool, people who had actually
applied to the college, because many would have been deterred from
applying.
2)

13.36

Measuring disadvantage

Indirect discrimination is concerned with whether a PCP,
requirement or condition adversely affects those with a certain
protected characteristic more than others. The original definition of
indirect discrimination required comparing proportions of people
who were affected. This suggested a statistical exercise and much
case-law has developed around that. The looser wording in the EqA
2010, allows other kinds of evidence to prove particular
disadvantage, eg evidence from an expert witness,46 or from the
claimant and other individuals in the disadvantaged group.47
Nevertheless, statistics have retained a central role. The EHRC

13.37

Employment Code explains how to carry out a statistical
comparative exercise at paras 4.21–4.22.
Comparing proportions (fractions or percentages) of those
affected rather than absolute numbers makes a difference. For
example, a Spanish national may claim indirect discrimination
because s/he cannot speak fluent English as his/her potential
employer requires. The appropriate comparison is not the total
number of Spanish people who cannot speak fluent English as against
the total number of non-Spanish people who cannot speak fluent
English. The proper comparison is the proportion of all Spanish
people who cannot speak fluent English as against the proportion of
all non-Spanish people who cannot do so. The calculation could be
done as follows:
A = The total number of Spanish people within the chosen pool (eg
100)
B = The number of Spanish people within the pool who cannot speak
fluent English (eg 95)
C = The total number of non-Spanish people in the pool (eg 100,000)
D = The number of non-Spanish people in the pool who cannot speak
fluent English (eg 10,000).

13.38

It would be meaningless to look at absolute numbers and compare the
actual number of Spanish people in the pool who cannot speak fluent
English with the even larger number of non-Spanish people in the
pool who cannot do so, since there are far fewer Spanish people in
the world anyway. Therefore proportions are calculated, ie:
B is divided by A; and
D is divided by C
to get the fractions to be compared. Percentages can be calculated by
multiplying each fraction by 100. In this example, 95 per cent of
Spanish people in the pool compared with ten per cent of nonSpanish people in the pool are disadvantaged by the fluent English
requirement.

13.39

13.40

13.41

A racial group can comprise two or more distinct racial groups.48
For example, a black British person could describe him/herself as
black or as British or as black British for the purposes of his/her
claim. Presumably also, a Spanish national could fall into the group
of those with Spanish nationality or those with nationality of a
European country, or those with nationality of a country which does
not have English as its first language. The choice of ‘category’ may
affect the statistical outcome. Following the example in the previous
paragraph, since many workers of nationalities other than Spanish
also could not meet a fluent English requirement, comparing the
statistics as they affect Spanish people versus non-Spanish people
may be misleading. It may be more accurate to describe the Spanish
worker as ‘from a non-English-speaking country’ and compare the
extent to which workers from a non-English-speaking country, as
opposed to workers from an English-speaking country, would be
disadvantaged by such a requirement. Note that the comparison
cannot simply be made between Spanish workers and workers from
a non-English-speaking country: a comparison must be made
between those of a particular racial group against everyone else.
As already stated, it is not enough that the worker him/herself is at
a disadvantage. Some identifiable section of the workforce, even a
small one, must also share the disadvantage.49 The PCP need not put
everyone with the relevant protected characteristic at a disadvantage,
but how much of a discrepancy needs to be shown in the impact on
those with the relevant protected characteristic and on those without
the relevant protected characteristic? The case-law developed under
the older definitions of indirect discrimination is useful where
statistics are involved, but may now be considered too rigid in
certain respects. The emphasis now is on simply showing that an
identifiable group with the relevant protected characteristic has been
particularly disadvantaged. If not many people with the relevant
protected characteristic are disadvantaged, that may be relevant
mostly to whether the PCP is justifiable50
Looking at it statistically, the older cases said the disparate impact
should be analysed in terms of those potentially affected; it does not

13.42

13.43

matter if the practice under attack has no relevance to the vast bulk of
humanity.51 Thus a difference of one or two per cent with very small
percentages potentially affected or unaffected would be no less
significant than a difference between 30 and 60 per cent. A useful
measure of what amounts to a significant difference used to be the
‘4/5 ths’ or ‘80 per cent’ rule, which was commonly used in the US.
If the smaller percentage is less than 80 per cent of the larger
percentage, the difference is significant. However, UK courts have
rejected the idea of following any rigid rule or formula, suggesting
that ETs simply apply a common-sense approach.52 The Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has said that the significance
of statistical comparisons should be assessed by reference to factors
such as the number of individuals counted and whether they illustrate
purely fortuitous or short-term phenomena.53 A lesser disparity
which persisted over a long period could be sufficient.54 An ET can
take into account the make-up and overall numbers of the workforce
under consideration; the fact that no one without the relevant
protected characteristic is similarly disadvantaged, and the inherent
likely effect of the requirement or condition under challenge.55
It can make a big difference whether the impact of a PCP is
assessed by comparing those who are advantaged by it (eg who can
comply with it) as opposed to comparing those who are
disadvantaged by it (eg who cannot comply or who suffer a
detriment). Although the original definition and case-law measured
those who are advantaged, the current definition clearly indicates the
measure should be those who are disadvantaged.
It is not legally necessary to prove the reason why the group is
disadvantaged (although that might be evidentially useful in some
cases where there are no statistics, to show those with a certain
protected characteristic are at a particular disadvantage compared
with others). Nor is it necessary to prove that such reason is the same
as the reason why the worker is disadvantaged, as long as it is a
‘corresponding’ (essentially the same) disadvantage.56
The PCP puts or would put the worker at that disadvantage

The PCP must put the worker at a disadvantage, eg s/he does not get
a job because s/he does not satisfy a particular selection criterion. It
is also unlawful if the PCP ‘would put’ the worker at a disadvantage.
For example, a woman sees a job advert which states ‘full-time
workers only should apply’. The woman was suitable for the post
and would otherwise have applied, but she is unable to work fulltime because of childcare. The woman can claim indirect sex
discrimination, even if she has not actually applied for the job
(although it is usually much easier to bring a case if a worker
actually applies and waits to see whether she is rejected).57
A ‘disadvantage’ is not defined by the EqA 2010, but as well as
obvious disadvantages, it could include a denial of an opportunity or
choice, deterrence, rejection or exclusion.58 A worker need not
suffer actual loss, economic or otherwise, and it is probably enough
that a worker can reasonably say s/he would have preferred to be
treated differently. An unjustified sense of grievance will not count.
In relation to religious practices, the test is whether someone can
comply ‘consistently with the customs and cultural conditions of the
racial group’.59 For example, a Sikh man could in theory comply
with a requirement that he wear no turban – he need only take it off.
However, in practice he could not comply and would be
disadvantaged.
As stated above, the worker must be put at the ‘corresponding’
disadvantage to the group, not a different disadvantage.60 For
example, if an older worker’s disadvantage is inability to pass a
certain test, older job candidates as opposed to younger candidates
must also have disproportionately failed the test.
The relevant time to measure whether the PCP causes a disadvantage
is the date on which the worker suffers a detriment because of its
application.61 For example:

13.44

13.45

13.46

13.47

•

In one case, a woman of Asian origin who qualified as a teacher in Kenya could not
comply with a requirement for a clerical post of having English O-level. It was irrelevant
that she had the ability to gain an O-level and could in the past or in the future have
obtained one. At the time that the requirement was applied, she could not meet it.62

•

In another case,63 part-timers were selected first for redundancy. At the time of the
redundancy dismissals, the claimant was a part-time worker. It was irrelevant that she
could have changed to full-time working several years ago once her children had grown up,
since she had not in fact done so and at the time of the selection, she was still a part-timer.

Justifiable as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate
aim
The final question is whether the employer can prove that the PCP is
justifiable or, to use the wording of the current definition in the EqA
2010, ‘a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’.64 The
concept of justifiability is central to the law on indirect
discrimination. In practice there are numerous, often hidden, PCPs
with discriminatory effect in every workplace. The possibility of
bringing a successful case often turns on whether the PCP is
justifiable. In theory, the aim need not have been articulated or even
realised by the employer at the time when the measure was first
adopted. It can be an ex post facto rationalisation,65 but if it was not
thought of at the time, it is less likely to amount to a convincing
justification.
Justifiability is very much a question of fact. At one time an
employer needed to produce only what right-thinking people would
consider were ‘sound and tolerable reasons’ for applying a
requirement.66 Now it is not so easy. It is for the tribunal to make its
own judgment, upon a fair and detailed analysis of the working
practices and business considerations involved, as to whether the
PCP is justified. Unlike the test for unfair dismissal, it is not enough
for the employer’s decision to be within a band of reasonable
responses.67
What an ET would consider justifiable requires ‘an objective
balance between the discriminatory effect of the condition and the
reasonable needs of the party who applies the condition’.68 An
employer must show that:

13.48

13.49

13.50

•

the requirement was objectively justifiable regardless of race or sex (or whatever is the
relevant protected characteristic);

•

the requirement served a real business need of the employer;69 and

•

the need was reasonable and objectively justifiable on economic or other grounds, eg
administrative efficiency; it is not sufficient that the particular employer personally
considers it justifiable.70

13.51

There are two stages to the employer’s defence. The employer
must show:
1) that s/he had a legitimate aim; and
2) that applying the PCP was a ‘proportionate’ means of achieving that aim. It is important
not to forget this second part of the justification test. The central concept of
‘proportionality’ involves balancing the effect of the PCP with the employer’s needs.
These questions should be asked:
a) Is the objective sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right (ie the right not
to be discriminated against)?
b) Is the measure rationally connected to the objective?
c) Are the means chosen no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective?71

13.52

13.53

Even if the employer’s aims are legitimate, it may not be enough for
the employer to show that the PCP is the only way of achieving those
aims. In some situations, the ends simply cannot justify the means. It
is therefore always important to finish by looking at the overall
balance between the ends and the means.72 The impact on workers
sharing the protected characteristic generally is part of this balancing
exercise. Generally speaking, the greater the impact of the PCP on
the affected group (considering numbers affected and the amount of
damage), the harder it is to justify.73 The impact on the particular
worker bringing the claim may also be part of the balancing exercise,
although possibly only to the extent that it is typical of the impact on
the group generally.74 Also, where the worker has a concurrent right
under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), weighing
the impact on the individual may be a stronger factor.
The relevant EU directives are worded differently from the
definition of justification in the EqA 2010. Instead of referring to ‘a
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’, they state that the
means of achieving the aim must be ‘appropriate and necessary’. EU

13.54

13.55

13.56

13.57

case-law, as well as the directives, also requires the employer to
show the PCP was ‘reasonably necessary’.
Examples of factors which may justify a discriminatory
requirement are: hygiene; safety; consistency of care; consistency of
management; and important economic and administrative
considerations. Each case will depend on its precise facts and the
principle of balance.
Many reasons given by employers involve costs considerations. If
the employer’s reason for imposing a discriminatory PCP is solely
because it would be more expensive not to discriminate, this will not
be a legitimate aim. However, it is permissible for costs to be part of
the picture. This is often referred to as ‘costs plus’ by lawyers. The
‘plus’ factor is pretty wide and it tends to mean simply that there is a
wider context. For example, it can be a legitimate aim to reduce
expenditure as a result of resource pressures in order to balance the
books. Even if the aim is legitimate, however, the nature and extent
of the financial pressures should be examined when considering if
imposing the PCP was proportionate.75 For more discussion of this
in the context of justification to direct age discrimination, see para
14.12.
Often employers lose sight of their aims when imposing
discriminatory requirements. Where an employer seeks to justify a
PCP, it is worth establishing first what business need the employer
claims to have, and then examining whether the imposition of the
requirement serves (or is necessary to serve) that need at all. A
public authority’s failure to follow its public sector equality duty
(PSED) may be relevant to whether it can justify indirect
discrimination.76
Once it is shown that there is a discriminatory PCP, it is for the
employer to prove that it is justifiable.77 This can be forgotten by an
ET who may expect the claimant to show why the PCP is not
justifiable and to suggest alternative ways for the employer to
achieve the needs. Obviously it is helpful if workers can show how
employers could meet their needs by taking action with less
discriminatory effect, but workers should not be required to provide

such evidence. There have been a number of cases in recent years
concerning the justification of indirect discrimination in the
relatively newer areas of age and religious discrimination. These are
reported in more detail in chapter 14, but what is interesting is the
number of times a case is overturned on appeal because, although the
tribunals have found the employers’ aims to be legitimate, they have
failed to focus their minds on whether the means used were
proportionate. The tribunal must make a critical evaluation and
demonstrate this in its reasoning.78

Victimisation
The legal meaning of victimisation
13.58

13.59

It is unlawful to victimise a worker because s/he has done a
‘protected act’.79 Basically this means a worker must not be
punished because s/he has complained about discrimination in one
way or another. For example, a worker is made redundant on a
pretext because s/he recently took out a grievance complaining of
race discrimination. As long as the worker does not make her
complaint in bad faith, s/he must not be victimised, even if s/he is
wrong to suggest discrimination had occurred. However, giving false
evidence or information or making a false allegation is not
considered a ‘protected act’ if it was done in bad faith.80 The key
question is whether the worker honestly believed in the truth of
his/her allegation. As long as s/he was honest, it does not matter if
s/he had some ulterior motive for accusing the employer of
discrimination.81
A ‘protected act’ means:82
a)

bringing proceedings under the EqA 2010 or previous discrimination legislation;

b)

giving evidence or information in connection with such proceedings;

c)

doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection with the EqA 2010 or previous
discrimination legislation; or

d)

making an allegation (whether explicitly or not) that the employer or someone else has
breached the EqA 2010 or previous discrimination legislation.

13.60

13.61

13.62

In relation to pay, it is a protected act to seek or make a relevant pay
disclosure or to obtain information in such a disclosure.83 It is also
unlawful to victimise a worker because it is suspected that the
worker has done or may do a protected act.
Note that victimisation of a worker who complains of sexual
harassment may fall under the definition of further harassment under
EqA 2010 s26(3),84 as opposed to the main victimisation provisions.
It may be unclear on the facts which definition should apply. If in
doubt, the worker should claim in the alternative under both sections.
The primary purpose of the victimisation provisions is to ensure
that workers are not penalised or prejudiced because they have taken
steps to exercise their statutory rights or are intending to do so, and
that they are not deterred from their fundamental right to challenge
discrimination in the tribunals.85 This protection is particularly
important for workers who risk dismissal by bringing up
controversial issues, but do not have the requisite length of service to
qualify for a claim of unfair dismissal.
The law protects workers complaining about discrimination
against themselves as well as workers speaking out on behalf of
others. For example, a white worker must not be victimised for
supporting a black worker who has brought a grievance of race
discrimination. Similarly, a trade union representative could claim
victimisation if s/he is put under particular pressure by the employer
when s/he takes up discrimination cases.86 It is also unlawful to
victimise a worker because someone else has carried out a protected
act, eg s/he is a member of a trade union which has spoken out
vociferously about racism.87 Some people might call this
‘victimisation by association’, but it is unnecessary to introduce that
additional concept, which tends to lead into irrelevant questions such
as what ‘association’ means and how close the ‘association’ must
be.

Proving victimisation
13.63

Unfortunately, it can be hard to prove that victimisation has taken
place. A worker must prove three things:

1) s/he has done a ‘protected act’ (or the employer believes s/he has done or may do a
protected act);
2) the employer has subjected the worker to a detriment;
3) the reason the employer has subjected the worker to a detriment is because the worker has
done that protected act, ie the employer was motivated by it (even if unconsciously).88

1)
13.64

13.65

Paragraph 13.59 above sets out the different types of ‘protected act’.
The precise scope of doing anything ‘for the purposes of or in
connection with’ the EqA 2010 is uncertain. The taking up of a
public authority’s obligations under the public sector equality duty by
trade union officials or in-house equality trainers may well be
‘protected acts’. Other examples of ‘protected acts’ could be
encouraging a colleague to take up a discrimination case; issuing a
press statement referring to breaches of the EqA 2010; or
approaching the EHRC. Victimisation law protects those raising
discrimination issues formally or informally, not purely in ET
proceedings.
Where a ‘protected act’ consists of a verbal complaint of
discrimination, the employer may deny that there ever was such a
complaint. It is therefore advisable that any complaint of
discrimination or statement of intention to bring proceedings or to
give evidence should be put in writing at the time. If appropriate,
such written statement should be accompanied by a reminder to the
employer of the right not to be victimised under the relevant sections.
Whether the complaint is made verbally or in writing, the worker
needs to be clear that s/he is talking about discrimination rather than
general unfairness. If the worker did not clearly allege
discrimination, a claim could still be made (if applicable) on the
basis that the employer suspected s/he was doing so. If relying on
this argument, it should be set out in the ET1.
2)

13.66

The protected act

Subjected to a detriment

A ‘detriment’ is any disadvantage,89 eg dismissal, non-promotion or
refusal of a reference. Victimisation does not always take the

obvious form of dismissing or disciplining a worker. It may take
many less obvious and more subtle forms, for example:
•

pressurising a worker to drop an allegation of discrimination or threatening him/her if s/he
goes ahead;

•

writing direct to the worker (even though s/he is represented) and to his/her work
colleagues, warning of the risk that if the worker’s ET claim succeeds, staff may lose their
jobs and service-users suffer (this is as distinct from a reasonable although firm attempt to
persuade a claimant to settle his/her claim);90

•

withdrawing or reducing trade union facilities to a shop steward who is gathering evidence
for a discrimination or equal pay claim;

13.67

•

refusing holiday leave requests on the desired dates;

•

writing a poor reference or refusing to provide one at all.91

If the detriment amounts to harassment, a claim must be made as a
harassment claim under EqA 2010 s26 rather than a victimisation
claim.92
3)

13.68

13.69

13.70

Because of the protected act

As a matter of evidence, it is often difficult to prove that the reason
the employer has subjected the worker to a detriment is because the
worker has done a protected act. For example, an employer
dismissing a worker because s/he has made an allegation of racial
harassment may purport to do so because his/her work is poor. There
is no fixed time between the protected act and the act of
victimisation, but the closer in time the two events occur, the easier it
is to show a link between them.
The wording of the definition of victimisation differs slightly from
that in the previous legislation, and it is no longer necessary for the
worker to compare his/her treatment with that of a worker who has
not done a protected act. Nevertheless, such a comparison may still
be useful evidence to prove the reason why the worker was
subjected to the detriment.
The EHRC Employment Code says a protected act need not be the
only reason for the detrimental treatment; it is enough if it is one of
the reasons.93 This is consistent with the law on direct

13.71

13.72

discrimination, where the protected characteristic need only be an
important factor in the discrimination.94
Employers often say they are not punishing the worker for doing
the protected act, but for some other aspect of the worker’s
behaviour. The difficulty is where the line should be drawn. It is
unlikely to be victimisation if an employer disciplines or dismisses a
worker, not because s/he complained of discrimination, but because
s/he expressed his/her complaint in a violent manner or because s/he
telephoned the managing director at 3 am to talk about it. On the
other hand, tribunals should recognise that workers often express
their complaints in an apparently unreasonable way because they feel
upset. It would be contrary to the purpose of the victimisation law if
employers could take steps against workers simply because they had
used intemperate language or made inaccurate statements when
making their complaint. An employer who objects to ‘ordinary’
unreasonable behaviour of that kind should be treated as objecting to
the complaint itself. Tribunals should not distinguish between the fact
of the complaint and the way it is made except in clear cases.95
If the worker complains of discrimination which would not be
covered by the EqA 2010, even if s/he proved it happened, s/he may
not be protected.96 For example, a black worker who is dismissed
for complaining of a racial assault which took place outside the
course of employment (and therefore not covered by EqA 2010) may
not be able to complain of victimisation.97

Steps in the litigation
13.73

A difficult question arose under the old definition of victimisation as
to whether it was unlawful victimisation if the employer was merely
taking steps to protect his/her position in discrimination litigation.
The cases resolved this tricky issue by stating that, although such
steps may be action ‘by reason of’ the protected act, they did not
necessarily amount to a ‘detriment’. The question is whether a
reasonable litigant would regard the employer’s conduct as
detrimental. An employer’s reasonable conduct defending his/her
position in litigation cannot reasonably be regarded as a detriment.98

13.74

13.75

In the Khan case, which was brought under the former RRA 1976,99
Sgt Khan brought a race discrimination case in the ET regarding his
failed promotion. Before the ET hearing, he applied for another post.
When asked for a reference, his Chief Constable replied: ‘Sgt Khan
has an outstanding tribunal application against the Chief Constable
for failing to support his application for promotion. In light of that,
the Chief Constable is unable to comment any further for fear of
prejudicing his own case before the tribunal.’ Sergeant Khan claimed
victimisation. The House of Lords said there was no doubt that had
Sgt Khan not brought his original ET case, he would have been
supplied with a reference. However, the reason for the Chief
Constable’s refusal of a reference was simply to preserve his
position in the pending litigation. It was not motivated by the fact in
itself that Sgt Khan had brought a race discrimination case. The
House of Lords said the test that would usually work was to ask
whether the employer would still have refused the reference request
if the litigation had finished, whatever the outcome. If the answer
was no, then it would usually follow that the reason for the refusal
was the current existence of the proceedings – not the fact that the
worker had brought them in the first place.
This decision does not mean that employers have a free hand to
victimise workers as long as an ET case is running.100 The point here
was that the content of any reference was precisely the matter
awaiting adjudication in the existing ET case. The Chief Constable,
having taken legal advice, refused the reference because he feared
prejudicing his own case before the ET.
It is not possible to bring a case alleging that the content of
evidence given by witnesses in previous ET proceedings amounts to
victimisation, eg contending that a witness gave false and hostile
evidence because s/he was upset that the worker brought a
discrimination claim. This is because witness evidence attracts
judicial immunity.101 For the same reason, a worker cannot claim
victimisation in respect of what an employer says in documents
written for the tribunal proceedings, or because the employer refused
to disclose documents or applied for costs. But this does not mean a

worker has no remedy if the employer behaves badly during
proceedings – s/he can apply for the employer’s tribunal response to
be struck out or for costs, or s/he can seek extra compensation for
injury to feelings and aggravated damages.102 It may also be possible
to claim victimisation if the employer unlawfully pressurised a
witness to give evidence against the worker.103

References
13.76

If an employer refuses to give a reference or writes an unfavourable
reference because the worker has done a protected act, this is likely
to be victimisation. The worker may also have a victimisation claim
against a potential new employer, if the latter withdraws a job offer
or fails to offer a job because of the bad reference. However, this
will only apply if the new employer knows or is told about the
protected act, for example because the former employer has
mentioned in the reference that the worker has made a discrimination
claim. The fact that the prospective employer acted unlawfully by
withdrawing a job offer because of the original employer’s
discriminatory reference does not stop the original employer being
liable for his/her own discriminatory comments. The worker can
claim victimisation against both parties if the evidence is
available.104

Conclusion
13.77

As is apparent from all of the above, the difficulties in proving
causation severely limit the effectiveness of the victimisation
provisions in practice. Even so, it is often easier to prove
victimisation than direct discrimination in the ET. Victimisation is a
major practical problem in the workplace, but tends to be
overlooked as an industrial relations issue. It is remarkable how
often equal opportunities policies and training deal with direct and
indirect discrimination but fail to address victimisation.

Instructing, causing or inducing discrimination

13.78

13.79

13.80

Under EqA 2010 s111, it is unlawful for an employer to instruct,
cause or induce (directly or indirectly) someone else to discriminate
against a worker. If either the worker, or the person who is
instructed, caused or induced to take action, is subjected to a
detriment as a result of the employer’s conduct, s/he can bring a
tribunal claim. It does not matter whether the person instructed etc
actually caries out the unlawful act. For example, a GP instructs his
receptionist not to register any patient with an Asian name. If the
receptionist fails to follow the instruction and is subjected to a
detriment as a result, she can bring a claim against the GP.105 The
EHRC also has power to bring proceedings.
An EqA 2010 s111 claim can only be made where the relationship
between the person giving the instruction and the person receiving
the instruction is such that the former would be in a position to
discriminate against the latter under EqA 2010 Parts 3–7, eg the
person giving the instruction to the worker is the worker’s employer
or, if the worker is a contract worker, s/he is the principal.106 This is
a worrying limitation. For example, if a company instructed a job
agency not to send along any pregnant job applicants or temps, it is
unclear how the company would be in a position to discriminate
under EqA 2010 Parts 3–7 against the job agency. If this is correct, a
pregnant worker who was excluded could not claim against the
company under section 111, though she could still claim against the
job agency if it agreed to discriminate against her under EqA 2010
s55, and against the company, if the job agency was its agent under
section 109.
The scope of EqA 2010 s111 is little tested because under
previous legislation only the equality commissions could bring this
type of claim.107 In addition, the previous wording, eg under RRA
1976 s30, extended to instructions from a person with whose wishes
the recipient was accustomed to act. There may be more potential for
section 111 than is immediately apparent, but at the moment it seems
that such a claim will only be needed in limited circumstances where
the more conventional definitions of discrimination do not apply to

the situation. For a fuller description of this right, see EHRC
Employment Code paras 9.16–9.24.

Harassment
Overview
13.81

13.82

Until various changes to discrimination law made during 2003 as a
result of the EU Race Discrimination and General Framework
Directives,108 there was no explicit definition of harassment in the
discrimination legislation. Nevertheless, harassment was unlawful
under those statutes as a form of direct discrimination and a large
body of case-law developed. Some of this old case-law will still be
applicable, but most of it will be too restrictive as the specific
definition of harassment is worded more widely than the definition of
direct discrimination.
Employers are liable for harassment under EqA 2010 s40. The
definition of harassment in EqA 2010 s26(1) states:
(1) A person (A) harasses another (B) if–
(a) A engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant protected characteristic, and
(b) the conduct has the purpose or effect of–
(i)

violating B’s dignity, or

(ii) creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
for B.
13.83

13.84

The relevant protected characteristics are: age; disability; gender
reassignment; race; religion or belief; sex; and sexual orientation.
Although the harassment provision does not explicitly apply to
marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, harassment for
those reasons could be claimed as direct marriage or civil
partnership discrimination or unfavourable treatment because of
pregnancy or maternity.109
The harassment need not be related to the worker’s own protected
characteristic. A worker may also claim harassment in these
situations:

•

Remarks not directed at the worker: For example, racist jokes are made in the workplace
about black people; a black worker can claim harassment even if the jokes are not actually
directed at him/her.

•

Remarks about other people: For example, offensive remarks are made at a work
presentation about Muslim people; there are no Muslim workers in the room, but a nonMuslim worker finds the remarks offensive.

•

Harassment by association: For example, a worker has a child who is undergoing gender
reassignment; the worker’s colleagues repeatedly make offensive remarks about this.

•

False perception: For example, an Indian worker of the Hindu religion is subjected to
Islamophobic abuse because of a false perception that she is Muslim.

•

Where, for example, a worker is subjected to homophobic ‘banter’ even though his
colleagues know he is not actually gay.110

13.85

Harassment also covers a situation where the conduct does not take
place because the worker, or anyone else, has the protected
characteristic, but it is nevertheless related to the protected
characteristic. For example, a female worker previously had a
relationship with her boss. After it breaks down, her boss becomes
upset because he believes she is having a relationship with someone
else and he continually makes offensive remarks about this. The
boss’s conduct is not because of the worker’s sex, but because he
suspects she is having a relationship, which arguably is related to her
sex.111

Conduct ‘related to’ a protected characteristic
13.86

Unlike direct discrimination, it is not necessary to compare the
treatment of the worker with the treatment of a comparator who does
not have the same protected characteristic.112 Also, as explained
above, harassment need not be ‘because of’ the worker’s protected
characteristic. It is enough that it is simply ‘related to’ it. There have
been few cases on precisely what ‘related to’ means. The wording
suggests that the harassment needs only be connected with the
protected characteristic as opposed to caused by it. For example, it
may cover a situation where a male manager enters women’s toilets
to shout at a female cleaner who he believes to be skiving, when he

would have done the same thing to a male cleaner. In practice, the
words ‘related to’ rather than ‘because of’ could make a big
difference in certain situations, though it is generally untested how
close the connection has to be.113 It is the discriminator’s own
conduct which must be related to the relevant protected
characteristic. It is not enough, for example, simply that the employer
has failed to look into a complaint of sexual harassment; there must
be something about the employer’s own conduct which is ‘related to’
sex, eg a manager failed to investigate because he does not take
women seriously.114

Direct discrimination or harassment?
13.87

Where a claim is made for harassment, the treatment of the worker
cannot also be a ‘detriment’.115 This prevents a finding that a worker
has been subjected both to harassment and direct discrimination in
respect of the same treatment. Although ‘harassment’ is traditionally
understood as meaning behaviour such as verbal or physical abuse,
the legal definition is much wider. ‘Unwanted conduct which
violates a worker’s dignity or creates a hostile etc environment’
could presumably include actions such as oppressive disciplinary
action, which would normally be covered by the definition of direct
discrimination. It may be especially tempting to claim under the
heading of ‘harassment’ in those tricky cases where the wider
definition is helpful. If in real doubt as to which definition is most
appropriate, it may be best to claim in the alternative, eg ‘In the
events described above, I have been subjected to harassment
contrary to EqA 2010 s26 and s40(1) and/or direct discrimination
contrary to EqA 2010 s13 and s39(2)(d)’.

Unwanted conduct
13.88

It is crucial to prove that the behaviour was unwanted. Harassers
often try to suggest that black workers don’t mind racist banter, or
that women are happily flirting back. It is often argued that because

the worker has put up with the conduct for a long time, it is not really
unwanted. The EAT has given this short shrift:
One of the lay members of this Tribunal has observed that there are many situations in life
where people will put up with unwanted or even criminal conduct which violates their
personal dignity because they are constrained by social circumstances to do so. A classic
example … is that of the battered wife who for the sake of the children may remain at
home, permitting herself to be subject to violence, none of which she wishes, but all of
which she endures … Putting up with it does not make it welcome, or less criminal. It is
therefore not completely beyond the scope of reason to think that women in this particular
situation should behave as they did.116
13.89

13.90

If the worker has joined in some offensive banter, there can be a
number of explanations for this. Maybe the worker is trying to laugh
along and make him/herself less of a target. Or maybe the worker is
retaliating. Either way, it can still be the case that the words said to
the worker are unwanted. Also, (looking ahead to para 13.91), it is
still possible that the words were intended to violate the worker’s
dignity or, even if not intended, reasonably had that effect. It is even
possible that the parties were harassing each other. On the other
hand, if there is evidence that all concerned were genuine friends, it
may mean the conduct was not unwanted or that it is not reasonable
to consider it had the unlawful effect.117
If the harasser continues or intensifies the harassment or otherwise
punishes the worker after s/he complains to the harasser or to
management of the harassment, this may be unlawful victimisation as
well as further harassment.

Purpose or effect
13.91

The definition of harassment covers unwanted conduct which has
either the ‘purpose’ or the ‘effect’ of violating a worker’s dignity or
creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive
environment. It is important to note that where the conduct does not
have that ‘purpose’, ie where it is unintentional in that sense, it is not
necessarily unlawful just because the worker feels his/her dignity is
violated etc. To decide whether the conduct has an unlawful ‘effect’,

13.92

13.93

a tribunal must take into account the other circumstances of the case
and whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have that effect, as
well as the perception of the worker bringing the claim.118 The
starting point is whether the worker did in fact feel that his/her
dignity was violated or that there was an adverse environment etc,
but it is only unlawful if it was reasonable for the worker to have that
feeling or perception; nevertheless, the very fact that the worker
genuinely had that feeling should be kept firmly in mind.119 The
EHRC Employment Code suggests that relevant circumstances could
include the worker’s personal circumstances, eg his/her mental
health or capacity, cultural norms or previous experience of
harassment, and also the environment in which the conduct takes
place. On the other hand, a tribunal is unlikely to find unwanted
conduct has an unlawful effect if it considers the worker is
hypersensitive and other people subjected to the same conduct would
not have been offended.120 These difficulties are avoided if it can be
shown that the harasser’s ‘purpose’ was to create the adverse
environment. In that case, there is no objective test of whether it was
reasonable for the worker to feel his/her dignity was violated etc.
Indeed, if there was a campaign of unpleasant conduct designed to
humiliate the worker, it would not even matter if that purpose was
not achieved,121 although it would still need to be unwanted.
If the unwanted conduct stopped as soon as the worker complained
about it, the employer may argue this is relevant to whether the
conduct had the ‘purpose or effect’ of violating the worker’s dignity
etc. This may depend in part on the type of conduct and whether it
was obviously of a kind which could be unwanted. For a further
discussion of this in the context of sexual harassment, see para
14.143 onward.
Finally, it is important to remember that the definition of
harassment envisages something more than being upset or angry; the
words ‘intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive’
envisage a far more serious effect.122 The conduct also has to create
such an ‘environment’, ie state of affairs. Although ‘violating dignity’

does not necessitate the creation of an ‘environment’, the word
‘violate’ is stronger than simply ‘hurt’.123

Sexual harassment
13.94

As well as the general definition of harassment, there are two
additional definitions relevant to sexual harassment: i) unwanted
conduct of a sexual nature; and ii) where the worker is subjected to
further unwanted conduct because of his/her rejection of or
submission to previous harassment (see para 14.139 onwards for
details).

Vicarious liability
Overview
13.95

13.96

As explained in chapter 12, the employing organisation is legally
responsible for any discriminatory action carried out by one
employee against another, provided that the action is carried out in
the course of employment. This is often called ‘vicarious liability’.
The organisation is vicariously liable even if it did not instruct,
authorise, approve or even know of the discrimination. The question
of vicarious liability is most often disputed by employers in
harassment cases, where they want to avoid responsibility for what
the harasser has done.
When is a discriminatory act carried out outside the course of
employment? The most important case on this issue is Jones v Tower
Boot Co Ltd,124 where Mr Jones was subjected to a number of
horrific incidents of verbal and physical racial abuse. These took
place in work time and on work premises. The employers argued that
they could not be liable for such clearly unauthorised acts carried out
by fellow employees. The Court of Appeal disagreed, saying that the
words ‘in the course of employment’ should be given their natural
meaning. The whole point was to widen the net of responsibility
beyond the guilty employees themselves, by making employers
additionally responsible.

13.97

Discrimination carried out in work time and on the premises by
fellow employees therefore seems to be covered, even if it is
extremely serious and wholly unrelated to the employment, eg
physical assault. However, harassment often takes place out of work
time or during rest breaks. It will then be for each ET to decide on
the facts whether it took place during ‘the course of employment’.125
An incident which occurs during a chance meeting between work
colleagues at a supermarket, for example, would almost certainly not
be covered.126 Similarly, an incident when one employee visits
another where s/he is living outside work hours and on a purely
social basis will probably not be covered.127 On the other hand,
harassment during business trips, office Christmas parties, organised
leaving parties or a social gathering of work colleagues in the pub
immediately after work, may well be ‘in the course of
employment’.128 It will depend on the circumstances whether an
offensive Facebook post is done in the course of employment, eg
who belongs to the Facebook group, is the workplace identifiable,
does it refer to a particular employee who can be identified, and are
the contents of the post circulated at work?129
The employer’s defence

13.98

13.99

The employer is responsible regardless of whether s/he knew or
approved of the unlawful act, unless s/he ‘took all reasonable steps’
to prevent the discriminator from discriminating.130 It is for the
employer to prove this defence and it is a high bar.131 It is important
to remember that the employer’s responsibility is to take
preventative action; it is not a defence that the employer acted
promptly once s/he discovered the discrimination, eg by sacking the
harasser (although this may prevent liability for further
discrimination).
The tribunal should go through these stages when assessing the
defence: 1) Did the employer take any preventative steps at all? 2) If
so, were those steps reasonable? 3) Were there any further
reasonable steps which the employer should have taken?132 The
likely effectiveness or ineffectiveness of any step is a factor,

although not the only factor. If a step would have had no real
prospect of preventing discrimination, it is unlikely to be considered
reasonable. On the other hand, it’s not necessary that a step would
have been ‘more likely than not’ to have prevented discrimination.133
13.100
This defence does not often succeed. A written equal opportunities
policy is unlikely to suffice unless it is very actively implemented.
Brief and superficial training is unlikely to be effective or longlasting in preventing discrimination or harassment; training should
not be allowed to go stale – thorough and forcefully presented
training is more likely to be effective and last longer.134 As one ET
put it when allowing the defence: ‘Harassment [in the workplace] is
a live issue, not a dead letter.’135

Employer’s reaction to a complaint of harassment
Overview
13.101 In some cases, particularly in small organisations, the perpetrator is

in reality the employer and there is no one more senior for the
worker to turn to. In many cases, however, the perpetrator is a
colleague or intermediate manager and the worker may complain
about his/her treatment to more senior management. As protection
against victimisation, it would be wise to make the complaint in
writing.
13.102
The employing organisation will not only be vicariously liable for
the harassment itself, but it may also be guilty of direct
discrimination and/or victimisation in the way it reacts to the
complaint. The discrimination could occur both in the way the
complaint is investigated (or not investigated) and also in the
subsequent reaction, eg transfer or dismissal of the worker.
Is the employer’s reaction direct discrimination?
13.103 To show direct race discrimination, for example, it is necessary to

prove that the employer would not have reacted the same way if a
worker of a different race had brought an equivalent complaint; eg
the complaint would have been treated more seriously and

investigated more thoroughly and the worker would have been kept
better informed. Further, s/he would not have been transferred or
dismissed as a consequence. It is not necessary to have evidence of
any such comparable incident in the past, although it may make it
easier to prove. As with any direct race discrimination case, the ET
can infer from the evidence generally that a complaint from a white
person would have been dealt with in a more favourable manner.
13.104
The tribunals have been undecided about what is a sensible actual
or hypothetical comparison for this. Is the question how the employer
would have treated a white worker complaining of: a) racial
harassment by a colleague or manager; b) non-racial harassment or
violence from a colleague or manager; or c) any serious grievance?
The first option does not seem to be a helpful comparison because it
is far less common for such a situation to occur in most workplaces.
The second or third scenarios provide a more logical comparison,
but even then, it is not really comparable as there is not the same
stigma attached.
Is the employer’s reaction victimisation?
13.105 Whether or not the employer can be accused of direct discrimination

in the handling of and response to the complaint, his/her treatment of
the worker may amount to victimisation, ie penalising him/her for
raising the issue. See para 13.72 for further comments.
13.106
In specific circumstances, a worker may be able to claim unlawful
detriment or dismissal in relation to health and safety if s/he is
penalised by his/her employer for complaining about harassment. A
whistleblowing claim may also be possible.136 These other claims
may be useful where the victimisation provisions of the
discrimination legislation do not apply, eg because the harassment
was not based on one of the protected characteristics.
Constructive dismissal
13.107 As well

as any discrimination claim, if an employer commits a
repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract, an employee may
resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal137 provided s/he

meets the unfair dismissal eligibility requirements. What amounts to
a repudiatory breach is a question of fact, but in the key case of
Western Excavating (ECC) v Sharp,138 Lawton LJ said that:
Persistent and unwanted amorous advances by an employer to a female member of his
staff would … clearly be such conduct …

In Bracebridge Engineering v Darby,139 the employer’s failure to
treat seriously and fully investigate the worker’s allegations of
assault clearly amounted to a repudiatory breach of the implied term
of trust and confidence and the obligation not to undermine the
confidence of female staff.

Harassment by the public or third party harassment
Overview
13.108 Discrimination by members of the public is often referred to as ‘third

party harassment’, the member of the public being the third party. An
employer is not vicariously liable under discrimination law for third
party harassment. However, an employer may be guilty of
discrimination in his/her reaction to harassment by the public or a
complaint about it. For example, it may be direct discrimination to
ignore racial harassment from the public against a black member of
staff but to take action when a white worker makes an equivalent
complaint. In addition, failure to take appropriate action may entitle
an employee to resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal.
13.109
Under EqA 2010 s40(2) employers were explicitly made liable
for ‘third party harassment’ as if they had carried it out themselves.
This was introduced initially into the Sex Discrimination Act 1975
following a judicial review brought by the then Equal Opportunities
Commission (EOC).140 In 2013 the coalition government decided to
repeal section 40(2) despite 71 per cent of respondents to its
consultation opposing repeal.141 The government accepted that third
party harassment occurs, but felt it was wrong that employers should
be made legally responsible for it. This ignored the fact that
employers were only legally responsible if they had failed to take

reasonably practicable preventative steps. The government has now
indicated that it may reintroduce employers’ liability in relation to
third party harassment, at least in relation to sexual harassment.142
13.110
As things stand, employers can only be responsible under the EqA
2010 for harassment by the public or other third parties if their own
action or inaction means they themselves have carried out an act of
harassment or other type of discrimination.143 For example, it would
be direct race discrimination if an employer said ‘I am not going to
deal with that customer’s abusive remark because the sales person is
black’ or if an employer dealt with complaints about abuse from
service users more seriously when the victim was a white staff
member than when it was a black staff member. Or it could be
indirect race discrimination to fail to ensure every incident of racial
abuse by patients is recorded on an organisation’s incident reporting
forms because non-white staff members are more likely to be
subjected to racial abuse than white staff members.144 An employer’s
failure to take preventative or remedial action could be harassment
provided the inaction (as opposed to the original harassment) was
‘unwanted conduct’ and that the inaction was ‘related to’ the
protected characteristic. Usually that means the reason for the
inaction must have been because of a protected characteristic. For
example, just because an employer fails to do anything about a
woman’s complaint of sexual harassment does not mean that that
inaction is ‘related to’ sex. It might simply be a result of laziness or
inefficiency. On the other hand, the evidence might suggest the
employer’s attitude is in itself related to sex. Finally, the inaction
(again, as opposed to the harassment by the third party) must violate
the worker’s dignity or create the offensive environment.
13.111
Where the employer cannot be made liable for third party
harassment under the EqA 2010, it is a question of exploring claims
in the civil or criminal courts (see below).
Harassment by an agency worker
13.112 One legal difficulty which can arise is where a worker is harassed

by an agency worker who is placed with his/her employer. The

worker can only claim against his/her own employer in limited
circumstances. This is because an employer is only vicariously
liable for someone who s/he employs or uses as an agent.145
Unfortunately, it is unusual for an agency worker to fit into these
categories. If the agency worker repeatedly harasses the worker and
the employer knows this, the worker may be able to claim against
his/her employer in the same way that s/he can if harassment is by a
member of the public (see the preceding paragraph). The worker
cannot claim against the agency if s/he has no legal relationship with
it under the EqA 2010.

Civil or criminal claims outside the discrimination
legislation
Overview
13.113 Sometimes due to the limitations of the discrimination legislation,

other legal claims in the civil courts may be appropriate. These can
also apply where the harassment, eg assault or general bullying, is
not based on a protected characteristic. Usually an ET claim under
the EqA 2010 is preferable. It offers a simpler, quicker and less
formal procedure. Moreover, as an industrial court, the ET may be
more willing than a county court or High Court to understand and
believe the claim (although this may be too optimistic a view). In
addition, in most situations, the costs risk of losing in the county
court or High Court makes it an unrealistic option. However,
advisers may want to explore options such as trade union or
(infrequently) EHRC support, or whether the worker has legal
protection insurance. There may also be the option of a conditional
fee arrangement (‘no win, no fee’) with after-the-event (ATE)
insurance against costs risks. The following suggestions are not a full
list of civil and criminal possibilities.
Common law claims
13.114 Where the harassment involves physical contact, particularly if there

is a severe assault, the worker may have a claim for damages at

common law in civil assault against the perpetrator. Even where
there is no physical contact, a claim in tort may be possible where
the perpetrator intentionally inflicts injury (physical or psychiatric)
by his/her words or actions.146 An employee can also claim against
his/her employer for negligence if the employer fails to protect
him/her against victimisation or harassment which causes physical or
psychiatric injury.147 The employer will not be liable unless s/he
knows or ought to know that harassment is taking place and fails to
take reasonable steps to prevent it.148 Common law claims are an
underused remedy, and the possibility should not be overlooked. The
advantage of such claims is that it is unnecessary to prove the assault
was because of a protected characteristic. Longer time limits also
apply. It may also help if the assault was by a member of the public
or otherwise outside the course of employment. The disadvantages
are set out in the previous paragraph.
Protection from Harassment Act 1997
13.115 Although the Protection from Harassment Act (PHA) 1997 was not

designed for employment situations, it can apply. The following is a
summary of the provisions in relation to England and Wales. For the
slightly different provisions in Scotland, see PHA 1997 ss8–16.
Under PHA 1997 s1 a person must not pursue a course of conduct
which s/he knows or a reasonable person would know amounts to
harassment of another person.149 A ‘course of conduct’ means
conduct on at least two occasions.150 This needs to be carried out by
the same person or if more than one, there must be some link, eg they
are acting in concert or one is acting under instructions from the
other.151 Harassment is not defined except to say that it includes
alarming the person or causing the person distress and the conduct
can include speech.152 The conduct is not unlawful if it was
reasonable in the particular circumstances.153 Presumably, therefore,
reasonable disciplinary action, although causing distress, would be
excluded. On the other hand, a series of unjustified warnings may on
the facts amount to harassment.

Under PHA 1997 s4 it is also an offence to cause another person
on at least two occasions to fear that violence would be used against
him/her. There is an exception for reasonable self-defence.154
13.117
The worker can claim against the individual harasser or, in some
circumstances, against the employer. The concept of vicarious
liability under PHA 1997 is different from that under the
discrimination legislation. Nevertheless, an employer can be
vicariously liable under the PHA 1997 for harassment carried out by
his/her employees, provided there is sufficiently close connection
between the work the harasser is employed to do and the
harassment.155 Depending on the facts, it is likely that the employer
would be vicariously liable for a manager harassing a subordinate,
and possibly, for harassment by a colleague at the same level
working in the same team.156 If harassment is by a third party, eg an
independent contractor, the worker may similarly be able to sue the
third party’s employer.
13.118
Breach of PHA 1997 s1 or s4 is a criminal offence liable to
imprisonment or a fine.157 A civil claim can also be made for
damages for financial loss and anxiety.158 The High Court or county
court can also issue an injunction restraining the perpetrator from
continuing to harass.159
13.119
The PHA 1997 may be very helpful where the harassment is not
covered by the discrimination legislation, eg because it cannot be
proved that it is because of a protected characteristic or because it
took place off work premises and possibly outside the course of
employment, or was perpetrated by a member of the public. The
other great advantage is the potential to obtain a restraining
injunction, which is not available under the EqA 2010 in the ET.
Although the time limits are longer, it will usually be important to act
quickly, especially if an injunction is sought. The disadvantage of the
PHA 1997, as with all non-ET claims, is the more formal procedure
and the costs risks. The scope of the PHA 1997 for use in
employment cases is still being tested.
13.116

Criminal prosecution

13.120 Criminal prosecution is outside the scope of this book. Workers do

sometimes invite the police to prosecute for criminal assault where
physical harassment has taken place, but there are difficulties in
following this route. The facts are harder to prove due to the stricter
rules of evidence and the criminal standard of proof. Moreover, the
worker is simply a witness in a police action and loses control of the
process. An unsuccessful criminal case is likely to jeopardise any
parallel civil claim.

Bullying
13.121 Bullying or harassment, even if it is not attributable to a protected

characteristic, is now recognised as a workplace problem in itself. If
the bullying is carried out by the employer or if the employer fails to
deal adequately with a complaint, an employee may be able to resign
and claim constructive unfair dismissal.160 If the bullying is serious,
the worker may also be able to bring a civil or criminal claim as set
out above.161

Multiple discrimination
Introduction
13.122 The term ‘multiple discrimination’ is not used in the EqA 2010, but it

is used to refer to any circumstances in which discrimination occurs
because of more than one protected characteristic. There are three
different kinds of multiple discrimination:
1) ordinary multiple discrimination;
2) additive discrimination;
3) intersectional or combined discrimination; a subcategory of this is dual combined
discrimination.

These terms, apart from ‘dual combined discrimination’, are used for
the purpose of this book and by some academics, but have no
universally agreed meaning. The importance of having sufficient
evidence to prove discrimination on each of the protected

characteristics claimed cannot be stressed too heavily. It is better to
bring a claim focusing only on one or two protected characteristics
where there is strong evidence, than to weaken the overall effect by
adding numerous different protected characteristics without testing
whether each one stands up to close examination.

Ordinary multiple discrimination
13.123 Ordinary

multiple discrimination refers to a situation where a
worker has been discriminated against because of one protected
characteristic on one occasion and a different protected
characteristic on another occasion. For example, a worker is refused
promotion because she is a woman and a few months later, she is
made redundant because she is black. No special legal difficulties
arise, but the worker needs sufficient evidence to support each claim.
A common form of ordinary multiple discrimination occurs where a
worker is initially subjected to harassment because of one protected
characteristic, eg racial harassment, and as a result, develops a
severe depression. In itself, this remains a single protected
characteristic claim, ie for racial harassment, and the compensation
will include compensation for injury to feelings and health.
However, if the employer then treats the worker unfavourably
because of his/her depression or fails to make a necessary
reasonable adjustment, there could be a further act of disability
discrimination. For this, the depression needs to meet the definition
of disability.162

Additive discrimination
13.124 Additive

discrimination occurs when an employer discriminates
independently because of two different protected characteristics at
the same time. For example, an employer refuses to promote a
worker because she is a woman (the employer never promotes
women) and quite separately, because she is over 50 (the employer
only promotes younger workers). Again, there is no legal difficulty in
this kind of claim, but there must be sufficient evidence.

Intersectional or combined discrimination
13.125 Intersectional or combined discrimination occurs where an employer

discriminates against a worker because s/he has a particular
combination of protected characteristics. For example, the employer
fails to promote a woman over 50. The evidence shows that the
employer has promoted plenty of women. It is just that they are all
under 50. The employer has also promoted many workers over 50.
It’s just that they are all men. It is the combination of ‘older woman’
which the employer discriminates against. Intersectional or
combined discrimination usually involves only two protected
characteristics but can in theory involve more. For example, a young
Muslim man is subjected to harassment because of unfounded
stereotyped fears that he is a terrorist. This kind of stereotyping
would not have occurred if he was female or not Muslim or even an
older Muslim man.
13.126
It is generally thought that a legal finding of
intersectional/combined discrimination cannot be made under the
normal definition of direct discrimination in the EqA 2010 as a result
of two cases under the previous legislation: Bahl v The Law Society
and Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd v Griffiths-Henry.163 These
cases concerned direct discrimination claims involving two
protected characteristics, race and sex. It is arguable that neither
case presented a strong evidential basis for such a finding, so the
courts did not confront the issue head on. It is untested whether the
CJEU would consider that the European directives require protection
for intersectional/combined discrimination. The wording of the
directives seems only to cover discrimination based on a single
characteristic, though interestingly, paragraph (14) of the preamble of
the Race Discrimination Directive states that:
In implementing the principle of equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, the
Community should … aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality between men
and women, especially since women are often the victims of multiple discrimination.
13.127 If a worker believes that s/he has been discriminated against because

of an intersection of characteristics, the way to claim legally

therefore is on the basis of each protected characteristic separately.
For example, the young Muslim man could claim religious
discrimination and/ or sex discrimination and/or age discrimination.
This is possible because it is not necessary for direct discrimination
that the protected characteristic is the exclusive reason for the
employer’s treatment. It is enough if it is an important factor.164 The
actual or hypothetical comparator can incorporate the other protected
characteristics. For example, for the age discrimination claim, the
comparator would be an older Muslim man.
13.128
One of the difficulties with making a claim for
intersectional/combined discrimination as such is identifying an
appropriate comparator. In theory, the comparator is any person who
does not have all of the relevant protected characteristics.
Unfortunately, such a comparator is not as significant as in single
protected characteristic claims, because the more favourable
treatment of such a comparator is consistent with a number of
explanations. For example, if a black woman complains of
intersectional/combined discrimination, her comparator could be a
white woman, a black man or a white man. Each of those are equally
consistent with the discrimination having been based on just one
protected characteristic alone. The best evidence to prove
intersectional/combined discrimination will therefore be several
comparators or other evidence entirely, eg remarks or evidence of
stereotyping associated with the combined group.
Dual combined discrimination
13.129 ‘Combined

discrimination: dual characteristics’ was specifically
made unlawful under EqA 2010 s14, but the coalition government
decided not to bring this into force. Nevertheless, claims for direct
discrimination based on the combination or intersection of two
protected characteristics can still be brought on the basis explained
above.
Indirect combined discrimination

13.130 The combination of two different PCPs being applied at the same

time may disadvantage a worker because of his/her combination of
characteristics. An interesting example of this concerned a female
soldier of St Vincentian national origin in Ministry of Defence v
DeBique.165 The army’s requirement that soldiers be available on a
24/7 basis was aggravated because Ms De Bique’s potential
childcarer was a foreign national, who could not stay with her longterm. The EAT said:
The nature of discrimination is such that it cannot always be sensibly compartmentalised
into discrete categories. Whilst some complainants will raise issues relating only to one or
other of the prohibited grounds, attempts to view others as raising only one form of
discrimination for consideration will result in an inadequate understanding and assessment
of the complainant’s true disadvantage. Discrimination is often a multi-faceted experience.

Exceptions
13.131 The EqA 2010 sets out a number of exceptions where discrimination

is permitted. Some of the key exceptions applicable to all protected
characteristics are set out below. Exceptions which relate only to
certain protected characteristics are set out in chapter 14.

Occupational requirements
13.132 It is not discrimination for an employer to require a worker to have a

particular protected characteristic if the employer can show that,
having regard to the nature or context of the work:
•

it is an occupational requirement;

•

the application of the requirement is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim;
and

•

the worker to whom the employer applies the requirement does not meet it (or the
employer has reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the worker meets it).166

13.133 This exception applies to discrimination in recruitment arrangements

and job offers; access to promotion; transfer or training or any other
benefit, facility or service; and dismissal.167 The exception also
applies if a principal refuses to allow a contract worker to work.168

Examples of occupational requirements are given in relation to each
protected characteristic in chapter 14. The scope of occupational
requirements should be interpreted very narrowly as it is an
exception to the prohibition of discrimination. However,
occupational requirements can be used in certain situations as a form
of positive action, eg where a person with a particular protected
characteristic is best equipped to provide care or advice services to
others with the same protected characteristics. It may be relevant
whether the employer already employs other workers with the
needed protected characteristic on the same duties.

National security
13.134 An

employer may discriminate for the purpose of safeguarding
national security, as long as it is proportionate to do so.169

Statutory authority
13.135 There are various exceptions for statutory authority, which apply

where certain other legislation requires different treatment because
of a protected characteristic. Very generally, it is not age, disability
or religion and belief discrimination if an employer does anything
pursuant to a statutory requirement.170 For example, an employer can
lawfully dismiss a disabled worker if health and safety regulations
leave him/her with no choice.171 The statutory authority exception no
longer applies to race discrimination,172 except in some
circumstances in relation to nationality and residency
requirements.173 Differential treatment based on sex or pregnancy
and maternity is permitted if it is required to comply with laws
protecting women who are pregnant or who have given childbirth or
against risks specific to women.174

Insurance and pensions
13.136 There are complicated exceptions in relation to both insurance and to

pensions. These are outside the scope of this book.

Positive action
13.137 Positive

action under the EqA 2010 is voluntary. In certain
circumstances, an employer is allowed to take steps to assist
disadvantaged groups which would otherwise be discriminatory
against everyone else. In addition, public authorities may wish to use
positive action to help them comply with their public sector duty.175
The EHRC is keen to encourage positive action and devotes chapter
12 of its Employment Code to explaining how it works.
13.138
An employer can take positive action if s/he reasonably thinks
that:
•

people who share a particular protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage connected to
that characteristic; or

•

people who share a particular protected characteristic have different needs from those who
do not have that protected characteristic; or

•

participation in an activity by people who share a particular protected characteristic is
disproportionately low.176

The employer can then take any action which is a proportionate
means of achieving the aim of enabling or encouraging those people
to overcome or minimise the disadvantage or to participate in the
activity or to meet their needs. For example, an employer can target
job adverts at particular disadvantaged groups, by using specialist
media outlets and stating in the adverts that people from the targeted
group are welcome to apply. An employer can also provide open
days or training opportunities exclusively for those with particular
protected characteristics.
13.139
Discrimination at the point of recruitment or promotion is only
allowed in very limited circumstances, ie in what has come to be
known as a ‘tie-break’ situation.177 An employer can choose to give
preference through the recruitment process, including in the decision
as to who to appoint, to a worker from a disadvantaged group. This
is only permitted where the worker is as qualified as the other
candidate to be recruited or promoted. Also, the employer’s action
must be a proportionate means of achieving the aim of enabling or
encouraging people with the relevant protected characteristic to

overcome or minimise the disadvantage of the relevant group. The
employer must not have a policy of treating people who share the
relevant protected characteristic more favourably than those who do
not share it. It is not entirely clear what ‘as qualified’ means and
whether it means the favoured candidate must be as good in every
respect as the other candidate or simply have the minimum
requirements for the job.

Chapter 14: Key points
•

•

•

•

•

•
•
•

The Equality Act (EqA) 2010 covers the following protected
characteristics: age; disability; gender reassignment; being
married or in a civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity;
race; religion and belief; sex; and sexual orientation. These
were all covered by the previous legislation.
There is a defence to direct age discrimination – but not to
direct discrimination because of any of the other protected
characteristics. The defence is the same justification defence
as applies to indirect discrimination generally, except that the
aims must be of a public interest nature.
There are a number of exceptions particular to age
discrimination, eg regarding redundancy payments, the
minimum wage and benefits based on length of service.
The default retirement age has been abolished. Enforced
retirement is direct age discrimination unless it can be justified
as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.
The protected characteristic of ‘gender reassignment’ protects
those who have undergone, are undergoing or propose to
undergo a process for reassigning their sex. It is no longer
necessary for that process to be under medical supervision.
Workers who have a gender recognition certificate (GRC)
should generally be treated as belonging to their acquired sex.
‘Race’ includes colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and
possibly caste.
A wide range of ‘religions and beliefs’ are covered, even if the
belief is very personal to the individual concerned. Beliefs can
be scientific, religious or other; they can potentially include
vegetarianism, environmentalism and pacifism. A belief must
have a level of cogency, seriousness and cohesion and must
be worthy of respect in a democratic society.

•
•

‘Sexual orientation’ means orientation towards the same sex or
the opposite sex or both.
The general principles in chapter 13 should be read before this
chapter. See chapter 15 for more detail on disability, and
chapter 16 for evidence to prove discrimination.

Introduction
14.1

An overview of discrimination law, showing who is covered and the
protected characteristics, is set out in chapter 12. Chapter 13
explains the definitions of the different types of discrimination. This
chapter expands on the meaning of each protected characteristic and
provides examples of how the definition of discrimination will apply
in respect of each. The official statistics show that cases started in
the employment tribunals (ETs) following the introduction of fees in
2013 fell dramatically in respect of each protected characteristic
compared with the previous year. Since fees were removed in July
2017, the number of cases has greatly increased.

Age
Historical and European contexts
14.2

14.3

In 2000, the European Council issued a Directive Establishing a
General Framework for Equal Treatment in Employment and
Occupation.1 This is known as the ‘General Framework Directive’
or sometimes the ‘Framework Employment Directive’ or the ‘Equal
Treatment Framework Directive’. The directive forbids
discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation,
religion, disability and age. In order to implement the directive in
respect of age, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 20062
came into force on 1 October 2006. These have since been replaced
by the Equality Act (EqA) 2010. For an introduction to the effect of
Brexit on the applicability of EU law, see chapter 3 above.
Until the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) came
into being in 2007, there was no organisation with a statutory remit

to oversee the working of age discrimination law. Nor were there
any statutory codes, although the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) had issued some guidance for
employers.3 In the financial year 2019/20, 2,434 age discrimination
claims were started.4 In July 2018, the House of Commons Women
and Equalities Committee published its Inquiry Report into Older
people and employment.5 The Committee concluded (para 28):
Ageism remains a significant problem within British society and is affecting the ability of
people to continue working into later life, despite long-standing laws against age
discrimination. Discrimination in recruitment is a significant problem and the public sector is
not leading the way in the retention of older workers when it should be.

The protected characteristic of age
14.4

‘Age’ is a protected characteristic under EqA 2010 s5. It covers
workers of a particular age or age group. The law protects workers
of all ages against discrimination because of their age. There used to
be exceptions for retirement, but these no longer apply.6

Direct age discrimination
14.5

14.6

The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. Direct age discrimination occurs where a
worker is treated less favourably because of his/her age. For
example, an employer selects the oldest workers for redundancy.
Unlike all the other protected characteristics, there is a potential
justification defence to direct age discrimination. Employers can
justify direct discrimination if they can prove the less favourable
treatment is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.
This is the same wording as for the defence available for indirect
discrimination cases in relation to all the protected characteristics,
although case-law has established some additional requirements
when justifying direct age discrimination. See paras 14.10–14.14 for
further comments on the defence.

Discrimination because of perceived age
14.7

It is also unlawful to treat someone less favourably because of
his/her apparent age, eg an employer refuses to recruit a worker
because s/he guesses the worker is of a certain age, or because s/he
mistakenly thinks the worker is older than the worker in fact is, or
because the worker looks younger than s/he is and the employer fears
customers or clients will not take the worker seriously.

Indirect age discrimination
14.8

14.9

The definition of indirect discrimination is set out in respect of all
the protected characteristics in chapter 13. In respect of age, it is
where a worker is put at a disadvantage because of the application of
a provision, criterion or practice (PCP) which also puts or would
put those of the same age group at a particular disadvantage
compared with others. The worker can choose to describe his/her
own age group as appears appropriate.7 For example, a worker aged
55 could describe his/her ‘age group’ as ‘55’, ‘over 50’, ‘50–60’
etc. Obviously the choice of age groups will be determined by the
evidence available to show disparate impact on those of the
worker’s age.
An example of indirect age discrimination would be where an
employer requires job applicants to have lengthy prior experience.
This would put younger candidates at a disadvantage as they have
had less time to acquire such experience. Alternatively, an employer
wants recent graduates for a job. This would exclude the majority of
older candidates. A requirement which works to the comparative
disadvantage of employees because they are closer to retirement age
would also be indirect discrimination unless justified. It is
unrealistic to differentiate between age and retirement.8 For a list of
possible indirectly discriminatory requirements on age grounds, see
appendix B. It is also useful to read the recent Ryan v South West
Ambulance Services NHS Trust9, which applies the stages of
indirect discrimination as explained by the Supreme Court in
Essop.10

The defence to direct and indirect age discrimination
14.10

14.11

As mentioned above, an employer can defend a case of direct or
indirect age discrimination by showing that the treatment or PCP is a
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. This derives from
Article 6 of the General Framework Directive, which states that a
difference of treatment on age grounds is not unlawful if it is
objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, and if the
means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. The
directive (unlike the EqA 2010) goes on to give examples of
potentially justifiable differences of treatment. If any of these
examples are quoted against the worker, remember that they are only
examples, they do not appear in the EqA 2010, and must still be
justified on the facts of the particular case.
Because it is unique to have a defence available to direct
discrimination, there has been uncertainty whether direct age
discrimination cases ought to be harder to justify than indirect
discrimination cases, despite the wording of the defence being the
same. In its final consultation on the original Age Regulations, the
then government said, ‘treating people differently on grounds of age
will be possible but only exceptionally and only for good reasons’.11
The case-law does not suggest that direct age discrimination can only
be justified in exceptional circumstances, but logically one would
expect there to be a high threshold where the employer acts on
generalisations about people of a certain age rather than considering
an individual’s particular circumstances and capabilities. On a
judicial review brought by the National Council on Ageing
(operating through its membership organisation, Heyday), the High
Court asked the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to
comment on the defence to direct age discrimination. The CJEU
stated that the defence need not be restricted to a precise list of
potential grounds for justification such as is contained in Article 6 of
the directive.12 The CJEU went on to say that, allowing a certain
degree of flexibility, employers can only justify direct discrimination
if it is in pursuit of legitimate aims of a ‘public interest nature’. A
further discussion of this in the context of enforced retirement is at

14.12

14.13

paras 14.31–14.36. Subject to how the law continues to develop
regarding permitted defences to direct age discrimination, the
following observations may apply to direct or indirect age
discrimination.
The issue of whether saving costs can amount to a defence to
indirect discrimination in respect of any of the protected
characteristics is discussed at para 13.55. This question is equally
relevant to direct age discrimination, and it is interesting that many of
the cases do concern age discrimination. Employers can take costs
into account provided other factors also apply and it is not simply a
question of it being more expensive not to discriminate. So in the age
discrimination context, it is unlikely to be justifiable to fail to offer a
redundant employee redeployment solely because this will take
him/her past the age of 50, thus giving him/her an entitlement to an
expensive early retirement pension should s/he be made redundant in
the future.13 There have been a few extreme cases in recent years in
the field of age discrimination and redundancy pay or pensions,
where the courts have thought it justifiable for an employer to bring
forward a redundancy termination date so as to avoid giving a
worker an ‘undeserved windfall’.14 However, in most run-of-themill situations, it should be difficult to justify cutting short the normal
stages of a redundancy selection process in order to deprive an older
employee of a pension. One would expect the redundancy budget to
include covering those employees who happened to hit the age for
pension entitlement.15 On the other hand, where the aim is to break
even in the face of reduced budgets, it could be justifiable to have
indirectly discriminatory arrangements for access to voluntary
redundancy / early retirement schemes.16 In summary, there are
various ways in which an employer might treat a worker less
favourably on redundancy because s/he is near retirement or pension
age,17 and the key question will be whether the employer can show
the treatment was justified.
Another controversial area is whether customer preference or
corporate image is an acceptable defence to age discrimination.
Where this is based on stereotypes and used to justify direct

14.14

discrimination, it should be challenged as not being a legitimate
public interest aim. Defences such as health and safety or proximity
to retirement age, although more superficially attractive, may well be
based on assumptions and generalisations about the health and
abilities of workers of a certain age, and how long workers of any
age are likely to remain in a particular job. If a certain level of health
or fitness is genuinely needed for a job, it is better that an employer
applies a medical or fitness test to all job candidates, rather than
make assumptions that workers over a particular age will not be
suitable. A general health test may still be indirectly discriminatory,
in that it may disproportionately screen out older workers, but it will
be fairer than a directly discriminatory rule, in that it assesses the
actual individual. ‘Last in, first out’ (LIFO) may be justifiable
indirect discrimination as one of several redundancy selection
criteria but probably not as the sole criterion.18
The onus is on the employer to prove the defence, but the worker
should be ready to challenge the employer’s justification and demand
proof of any assumptions made about the link between age and
performance. Cases have revealed that a great deal of stereotyping
around age still exists.

Harassment: age
14.15

The general law on harassment in respect of all characteristics is set
out at para 13.81 onwards. Examples of harassment involving age –
deliberate or unintentional – could be teasing; offensive jokes;
hostile or patronising remarks; exclusion from team meetings or
social occasions; remarks about physical appearance linked to age;
being made to do menial tasks and run errands; bullying; and making
someone feel they ought to leave. Of course, the worker may be
happy with a certain level of joking and banter, especially on
occasions such as birthdays. However, if it is unwanted and if it is
reasonable to consider that it creates a humiliating or offensive
environment etc, remembering the seriousness of those words, then it
is unlawful.

Exceptions: Where age discrimination is allowed
14.16

EqA 2010 Sch 9 sets out most of the exceptions where
discrimination is permitted. Part 2 of the Schedule contains further
exceptions which apply only to age. The main exceptions applying
specifically to age discrimination are set out below.
Occupational requirements

14.17

The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected
characteristics is set out in chapter 13. In relation to age, an example
may be a TV production company requiring a young or young-looking
actor to play the role of a young person in a film. It is important that
stereotyped assumptions regarding age are not used when applying
the occupational requirement exception. For example, requirements
that staff in leisure industries be of an age which matches the targeted
customer group are not necessarily a proportionate means of
achieving a legitimate aim.
Armed forces

14.18

The rules against age discrimination do not apply to service in the
armed forces.19
Minimum wage

14.19

An employer may pay a worker a lower hourly rate because of age if
the worker is in a lower national minimum wage band than his/her
comparator and the worker is paid less than the national living wage,
ie the rate for adults aged 23 and above.20 For example, in the year
starting 1 April 2021, waiter A (aged 19) falls within the 18–20
band (minimum rate £6.56 per hour). Waiter B (aged 26) is within
the national living wage band (minimum rate £8.91 per hour). An
employer is entitled to pay B £10.00 per hour and pay A, because he
is younger, £7.00 per hour. However, if the employer pays A £9.00
per hour, the exception does not apply, because A is now paid more
than the national living wage rate. Waiter A can claim direct

discrimination and the employer will have to justify the pay
difference in the usual way.
Benefits based on length of service
14.20

14.21

14.22

EqA 2010 Sch 9 para 1021 exempts certain benefits based on length
of service. It is common for employers to give pay increments or
other enhanced benefits, eg longer holiday entitlement, for each year
of employment. This indirectly discriminates against younger
workers. The EqA 2010 permits these enhancements for the first five
years of a worker’s service. After that, an employer must justify
applying length of service criteria to pay or benefits, but the usual
objective test for justification does not apply. The employer need
only show that it reasonably appears to him/her that the service
criterion fulfils a business need. The previous legislation gave
examples such as rewarding experience and loyalty and increasing
motivation. These were only examples, but are still likely to apply.
Service requirements can also discriminate against other workers
who are less likely to build up long service eg women because of
career breaks, or black workers because of previous discrimination.
Indirect discrimination cases can therefore be brought in relation to
other protected characteristics. The Cadman test case, which was
brought under the former Equal Pay Act (EqPA) 1970, concerned
what level of justification is necessary for pay increments which
indirectly discriminate against women.22 The decision in that case
indicated that although justification is usually self-evident, it can be
challenged in special circumstances. It is interesting to consider
whether that means the general service-related benefits exemption in
relation to age, which does not allow for consideration of special
circumstances in individual cases, could be challenged as contrary to
European law.
The Schedule 9 para 10 exemption does not include any benefit
awarded to a worker because s/he has stopped working for the
employer,23 eg redundancy pay. However, redundancy selection
criteria could be considered a ‘benefit’ and would be covered,
presumably because the worker has not yet been selected for

dismissal. This means that criteria such as LIFO, which disadvantage
younger workers, require a lower standard of justification in relation
to indirect age discrimination.24 However, if LIFO also
discriminated against women or black workers, it would need proper
justification under the usual test in relation to indirect sex or race
discrimination, since there is no equivalent exemption for servicerelated benefits for those protected characteristics.
Redundancy payments
14.23

Direct and indirect age discrimination in the calculation of
redundancy pay is permitted in certain circumstances. Details are set
out at para 18.23.
Life assurance

14.24

It is not age discrimination for an employer to provide a worker with
insurance cover or a related financial service which ends at the age
of 65 or any later state pensionable age. Nor is it age discrimination
only to provide such insurance or service to workers below that
age.25
Childcare benefits

14.25

It is not age discrimination for an employer to provide childcare
facilities only in respect of children of certain ages.26 This includes
paying some of the costs and helping the parent to find a carer or
spend more time caring for the child him/herself.
Pensions

14.26

Certain discrimination in pensions is permitted, but this is a very
complex area and beyond the scope of this book.27

Retirement
14.27

Until abolished on 1 October 2011 (with some transitional
provisions), a default retirement age of 65 used to apply. Provided
an employer followed the correct statutory procedures, an employee

14.28

14.29

14.30

(though not other kinds of worker) could be forced to retire at 65 and
would be unable to claim age discrimination or unfair dismissal.
This is no longer the case. The usual rules of unfair dismissal and
age discrimination now apply if an employee is forced to retire.
It is direct age discrimination to dismiss a worker or force him/her
to retire because s/he has reached a certain age, unless this can be
objectively justified. This applies whether an employer is applying a
general normal retirement age or is just making a decision in respect
of an individual worker. Primarily it is the general rule which has to
be justified since, if it is, its application to the individual will
usually also be justified.28 The term ‘EJRA’ (employer justified
retirement age) is sometimes used to refer to a situation where an
employer imposes a contractual retirement age in place of the
abolished default retirement age. Employers following this route will
need to justify doing so as a proportionate means of achieving a
legitimate aim.
In the key case of Seldon v Clarkson Wright & Jakes and
Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills,29 the
Supreme Court analysed various CJEU cases and gave guidelines as
set out in paras 14.32–14.34 below on what an employer must prove
to justify imposing a retirement age.
The Supreme Court (SC) said that in order to justify direct age
discrimination, the employer’s aims must be of a public interest
nature consistent with the UK’s social policy objectives, as opposed
to purely individual reasons particular to an employer’s situation,
such as cost reduction or improving competitiveness. Two different
kinds of legitimate objective have been identified by the CJEU. The
first kind can be summed up as ‘inter-generational fairness’, eg
facilitating access to employment by young people; enabling older
people to remain in the workforce; sharing limited opportunities to
work in a particular profession fairly between the generations; or
promoting diversity and the interchange of ideas between younger
and older workers. The SC felt this aim was comparatively
uncontroversial.

14.31

14.32

14.33

14.34

The SC said that the second kind of aim which the CJEU believes
is legitimate can be summed up as ‘dignity’, eg avoiding the need to
dismiss older workers on the grounds of incapacity or
underperformance, thus preserving their dignity and avoiding
humiliation, or avoiding the need for costly and divisive disputes
about capacity or underperformance. The SC felt that the assumptions
underlying these objectives look suspiciously like stereotyping.
However, the CJEU has said that the avoidance of unseemly debates
about capacity is capable of being a legitimate aim.
The SC said it is not enough that the employer’s aim falls into
these categories and is capable of being a legitimate aim. It still has
to be legitimate in the particular circumstances of the case. For
example, improving the recruitment of young people in order to
achieve a balanced and diverse workforce is in principle a
legitimate aim. However, if there is in fact no problem in recruiting
the young, and if the real problem is in retaining the older and more
experienced workers, then it may not be a legitimate aim for the
business concerned. Avoiding the need for performance management
may be a legitimate aim, but if in fact the business already has
sophisticated performance management measures in place, it may not
be legitimate to avoid them for only one section of the workforce.
Similarly, it may be a legitimate aim to protect public-sector workers
nearer retirement from the effect of changes in their pension scheme,
but only if the government can show that older workers really would
be more badly affected than younger workers.30
Following Seldon, it is important to remember that the defence to
direct age discrimination does not stop with whether the employer’s
aim is legitimate. The means used must also be proportionate. Even
if an employer can justify imposing a retirement age, it does not mean
that the particular retirement age selected is proportionate. On the
other hand, the retirement age used by the employer will not be
disproportionate purely because an age slightly higher or lower
would have been equally justifiable.31
It is useful to follow through this little checklist when considering
whether an employer has justified applying a retirement age to a

worker:
•

Identify the employer’s aim in applying the retirement age.

•

Consider whether this is genuinely the employer’s aim or a false reason put forward for the
purpose of defending the case.

•

Consider whether the aim is generally capable of being a legitimate social policy aim.

•

If so, consider whether the aim was legitimate in the particular circumstances of the case.

•

If so, consider whether applying the retirement age rule (including the particular age
chosen) was a proportionate means of achieving that aim.

14.35

14.36

As anticipated by the SC in Seldon, many of the justifications put
forward in tribunals for imposing a retirement age to date have
included the need for workforce planning; encouraging staff retention
by making available promotion routes; and maintaining a ‘collegiate’
atmosphere by enabling older workers to retire with dignity rather
than having to take them up on deteriorating performance. All of
these reasons would need proving in the context of the particular
workplace, both in terms of legitimate aims and in terms of
proportionate means. In most organisations these days, staff turnover
is relatively high (unlike perhaps the level of turnover among
partners in professional firms, where the test cases to date tend to
have occurred). It therefore seems unlikely that older workers
staying on past a predictable retirement age have much or any impact
on promotion vacancies or workforce planning. The exception might
be a very small employer with long-serving staff.32
As for the ‘collegiate’ atmosphere, that would be an argument
against dismissing employees of any age for a variety of reasons
connected with performance. It is not usually something which
concerns employers or is thought to damage the employer’s
organisation. Moreover, the assumption that older workers will have
greater performance difficulties than younger workers and that they
should be deprived of the same opportunity for performance
management reeks of stereotyping. The question is whether it is
proportionate to make a whole workforce retire at a particular age
just to avoid putting a few individuals through a capability
procedure.

14.37

This is an area where unfounded stereotypes can easily creep in.
The research report cited by the High Court in Heyday pointed out
that, except in a very limited range of jobs, work performance does
not deteriorate with age, at least up to age 70.33 In the light of that,
the High Court said that if employers had adverse perceptions of
employees between 65 and 70, it was likely these were precisely the
result of stereotypical thinking. More recently, the House of
Commons Select Committee Report on Older people and
employment said:
There are four main misconceptions that seem to underpin employer bias against older
workers: that younger workers cost less; that younger workers are likely to be more
productive; that younger workers will provide the employer with more years of work; and
that older people need to leave work in order to ‘make way’ for younger people. We heard
evidence refuting all of these stereotypes.34

14.38

When considering justifications for age discrimination, it is worth
remembering the warning of the House of Lords against stereotyping
(albeit racial) in the Roma Rights Centre case.35 Regarding unfair
dismissal, a retirement dismissal will probably now be a dismissal
for ‘some other substantial reason’ (SOSR), whether or not it is fair
will presumably depend on the considerations discussed above.

Disability
14.39

Disability is covered in chapter 15.

Gender reassignment
Historical and European contexts
14.40

Discrimination because of gender reassignment was previously
covered by the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA) 1975, although the
EqA 2010 made a step forward by removing the requirement that
gender reassignment be a medical process. In its 2016 report on
Transgender equality,36 the Women and Equalities Parliamentary
Select Committee pointed out that the terms ‘gender reassignment’
and ‘transsexual’ in the EqA 2010 ‘are outdated and misleading, and

may not cover wider members of the trans community’. The Select
Committee recommended that the protected characteristic should be
amended to that of ‘gender identity’. The government has rejected
this idea, as it did when the same issue arose on the passage of the
EqA 2010 through parliament. This leaves the unsatisfactory position
whereby workers who are discriminated against because they are
non-binary, non-gendered or gender fluid are not clearly protected,
although a recent ET decision has suggested the protection may be
wider (see below). Meanwhile, the Select Committee recognised
that high levels of transphobia are experienced by individuals on a
daily basis. A survey of 410 trans workers in 2021 indicated that 25
per cent had experienced transphobic discrimination from work
colleagues and 17 per cent from managers, an improvement from
2016, but with higher figures over preceding years.37 Sixty-five per
cent had still felt the need to hide their gender status or history at
work. A Trades Union Congress (TUC) survey in 2017 found similar
levels of discrimination and bullying. It said that 30 per cent of trans
respondents had had their transgender status outed against their will.
In a 2018 survey, one in three employers were prepared to admit that
they were less likely to hire a transgender worker.38

The protected characteristic of gender reassignment
14.41

A ‘transsexual person’ under the EqA 2010 is someone who has the
protected characteristic of gender reassignment. Under EqA 2010 s7,
a worker has the protected characteristic of ‘gender reassignment’ if
s/he is ‘proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a
process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the
person’s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex’.
Unlike the previous position under the SDA 1975, it is not necessary
that such a process be under medical supervision. The EHRC
Employment Code gives the example of a person born physically
female, who decides to spend the rest of his life as a man. He lives
as a man but does not seek medical advice because he successfully
passes as a man without the need for any medical intervention. He
would have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment.

14.42

14.43

14.44

It is strongly arguable that for the purposes of sex discrimination
law, a trans person must be regarded as having the sexual identity of
the gender to which s/he has been reassigned.39 This should certainly
be the position if the worker has acquired a gender recognition
certificate (GRC) under the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2004.
The GRA 2004 enables trans people to obtain legal recognition of
their acquired gender on obtaining a full GRC by a Gender
Recognition Panel.40 This means that the person should be treated
entirely as of his/her acquired gender from then on (with very limited
exceptions). GRA 2004 ss1–3 set out the basis on which a certificate
will be issued. The GRA 2004 was passed following comments by
the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) that to deny this right
could be a breach of European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)
Article 8 (the right to respect for private life).41
In its 2016 report, the Women and Equalities Parliamentary Select
Committee recommended that the government update the GRA 2004,
stating that it was pioneering but is now dated. It said its medicalised
approach pathologises trans identities and runs contrary to the dignity
and personal autonomy of applicants. In view of evidence of
underuse of the GRA 2004, the government did eventually consult on
its reform in August 2018. In September 2020, the government finally
announced its response and that no change would be made to the
criteria for legal gender recognition.42 The Women and Equalities
Committee then launched a further inquiry into reform of both the
GRA 2004 and the EqA 2010, including the question whether
reforms are needed to better support the rights of gender-fluid and
non-binary people.43
Meanwhile in Taylor v Jaguar Land Rover,44 an ET decided that
‘gender reassignment’ could encompass a non-binary or gender fluid
person. It said this (at para 178):
We thought it was very clear that Parliament intended gender reassignment to be a
spectrum moving away from birth sex, and that a person could be at any point on that
spectrum. That would be so, whether they described themselves as ‘non-binary’ i.e. not at
point A or point Z, ‘gender fluid’ i.e. at different places between point A and point Z at
different times, or ‘transitioning’ i.e. moving from point A, but not necessarily ending at

point Z, where A and Z are biological sex. We concluded that it was beyond any doubt that
somebody in the situation of the Claimant was (and is) protected by the legislation because
they are on that spectrum and they are on a journey which will not be the same in any two
cases. It will end up where it does. The wording of section 7(1) accommodates that
interpretation without any violence to the statutory language.

14.45

14.46

14.47

The ET’s reasoning would appear also to apply to other trans
identities, though not someone who simply performed drag without
any change of their gender identity. The Taylor case is likely to be
influential, but it has not been appealed so it remains with no
precedent value.
Where there is uncertainty regarding whether a worker will be
protected under the protected characteristic of ‘gender
reassignment’, it may also be possible to argue such discrimination
is sex discrimination, on an extended definition of ‘sex’ or that it is
based on perception that they might undergo or have undergone
gender reassignment, but this is an untested area.
When running a legal case, it will usually be desirable to avoid
the term ‘transsexual’ as far as possible so as to avoid the risk of
offence. Where necessary to refer to the statute, it can be said that a
worker has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. As
already indicated, for many, ‘trans’ or ‘transgender’ are preferred
terms. However, be aware that these terms can cover all those who
feel their gender identity does not match the single gender assigned to
them at birth, regardless of whether they wish to undergo gender
reassignment. Advisers need to understand exactly what a worker
means when referring to themselves as a trans person. This may be
relevant to how well the law fits the circumstances.
For an introduction to the latest issues around gender identity, see
the latest update of the judiciary’s Equal Treatment Bench Book,
chapter 12 (‘Transgender people’).45 UNISON and the Scottish
Transgender Alliance have produced an excellent guide, Gender
identity: an introductory guide for trade union reps supporting
trans members.46 An ACAS Research Paper, Supporting trans
employees in the workplace47 has useful good practice advice, as

does the government guidance for employers: Recruiting and
retaining trans gender staff: a guide for employers.48

Direct discrimination because of gender reassignment
14.48

The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. In the context of gender reassignment, it
is unlawful to treat a worker less favourably because s/he proposes
to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone gender reassignment. The
comparison is with the way the employer treats or would treat a
worker who has not undergone, is not undergoing and does not
propose to undergo gender reassignment. Alternatively, it may be
appropriate to compare the worker’s treatment with that of a person
of the worker’s original sex.49 In addition, it would be
discriminatory to treat a worker’s time off for gender reassignment
less favourably than a routine sickness absence.50 It may also be
discriminatory to treat such absence less favourably than an absence
for some other cause would be treated, eg paid or unpaid leave, but
this depends on whether it is reasonable to do so.

Harassment: gender reassignment
14.49

Harassment in relation to all the protected characteristics is set out
from para 13.81 onwards. There are three definitions of harassment
which can apply to gender reassignment: the general definition;
unwanted conduct of a sexual nature; and harassment because of
rejection of submission to the conduct.51 For more detail on these,
see paras 14.136–14.144 in relation to sex.

Exceptions
Occupational requirements
14.50

The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected
characteristics is set out in chapter 13. In the case of gender

reassignment, it only applies to a requirement not to be a ‘transsexual
person’.52
Religious requirements
An employer may apply to a worker a requirement not to be a
‘transsexual person’, if s/he can show:

14.51

•

the employment is for the purposes of an organised religion;

•

the application of the requirement engages the compliance or non-conflict principle; and

•

the worker to whom the employer applies the requirement does not meet it (or the
employer has reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the person meets it).53

14.52

The ‘compliance principle’ occurs where the requirement is applied
so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion. The ‘non-conflict
principle’ applies where, because of the nature or context of the
employment, the requirement is applied so as to avoid conflicting
with the strongly held religious views of a significant number of the
religion’s followers. This exception should only be used for a
limited number of posts, eg ministers of religion and a small number
of other posts, including those which exist to promote or represent
the religion.54 It is unlikely to cover jobs such as cleaners, or even
teachers in religious schools. The term ‘for the purposes of an
organised religion’ does not mean ‘for the purposes of a religious
organisation’ such as a faith school.55 This exception applies to
discrimination in recruitment arrangements and job offers; access to
promotion, transfer or training or any other benefit, facility or
service; and dismissal.
Armed forces

14.53

The armed forces can require a person not to be transsexual if that is
a proportionate means of ensuring combat effectiveness.56

Marriage and civil partnership
Historical and European contexts

Discrimination because of marriage and civil partnership was
previously covered by the SDA 1975.

14.54

The protected characteristics of marriage and civil
partnership
Under EqA 2010 s8, a worker has the protected characteristic of
marriage or civil partnership if s/he is married or a civil partner.

14.55

Direct marriage or civil partnership discrimination
The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. It is unlawful to discriminate against a
worker because s/he is married or a civil partner. The evidence
needs to show that the discrimination is specifically because of the
individual’s marital (or civil partnership) status and not simply
because the worker is involved in a close relationship akin to
marriage, eg a cohabiting partner.57 For example:

14.56

•

An employer refuses to offer a married woman a job because s/he assumes the woman
will soon want children, and this assumption would not have been made if the woman was
unmarried.

•

A church employer dismisses a clergyman because he is having difficulties within his
marriage and this damages its promotion of marriage as an important institution.58

•

A police officer’s appointment to a particular division is rescinded because the law means
she would be unable to give evidence against her spouse, who is Chief Superintendent in
the same division, in any criminal proceedings.59

14.57

14.58

There have been conflicting Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)
cases as to whether it is direct marriage discrimination to treat a
worker less favourably because s/he is married to a particular
person. The latest and most probably correct view is that the answer
is no – not if the real reason for the less favourable treatment is the
close association between the couple.60
It is not unlawful under the EqA 2010 to discriminate against
workers because they are unmarried or not a civil partner.61

Discrimination against a worker because s/he is divorced does not
appear to be covered, but discrimination against a worker because
s/he is married and in marital difficulties could be discrimination if
the evidence shows that the employer would not have minded so
much if an unmarried worker was in relationship difficulties.62

Indirect marriage or civil partnership discrimination
The definition of indirect discrimination is set out in respect of all
the protected characteristics in chapter 13.

14.59

Harassment: marriage and civil partnership
The specific definition of harassment does not cover harassment
related to marriage or civil partnership. If such harassment occurs, it
will be necessary to rely on the usual definition of direct
discrimination.

14.60

Exceptions
Occupational requirements
The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected
characteristics is set out in chapter 13. In the case of marriage and
civil partnership, it only applies to a requirement not to be married
or a civil partner.63

14.61

Religious requirements
An employer may apply a requirement not to be married or a civil
partner, or not to be married to or the civil partner of a person who
has a living former spouse or civil partner, or a requirement relating
to the circumstances in which a marriage or civil partnership came to
an end. For this, the employer must show that:

14.62

•

the employment is for the purposes of an organised religion;

•

the application of the requirement engages the compliance or non-conflict principle; and

•

the worker to whom the employer applies the requirement does not meet it (or the
employer has reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the person meets it).64

14.63

The ‘compliance principle’ occurs where the requirement is applied
so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion. The ‘non-conflict
principle’ applies where, because of the nature or context of the
employment, the requirement is applied so as to avoid conflicting
with the strongly held religious views of a significant number of the
religion’s followers. This exception should only be used for a
limited number of posts, eg ministers of religion and a small number
of other posts, including those which exist to promote or represent
the religion.65 It is unlikely to cover jobs such as cleaners, or even
teachers in religious schools. The term ‘for the purposes of an
organised religion’ does not mean ‘for the purposes of a religious
organisation’ such as a faith school.66 This exception applies to
discrimination in recruitment arrangements and job offers; access to
promotion, transfer or training or any other benefit, facility or
service; and dismissal.

Pregnancy and maternity
14.64

The law on pregnancy and maternity operates a little differently from
that in respect of the other protected characteristics. It is therefore
dealt with separately at chapter 11.

Race
Historical and European contexts
14.65

The first Race Relations Act was passed in 1965, after Lord
Brockway had unsuccessfully presented a race relations bill to
parliament on nine occasions. Race discrimination in employment
was not covered until the 1968 Race Relations Act, and even then,
individuals could not bring their own cases in tribunals. They had to
go through what was then the Race Relations Board. The first time
individuals could directly claim in tribunals was with the Race
Relations Act (RRA) 1976. The RRA 1976 was modelled on the Sex

14.66

14.67

Discrimination Act of the previous year. The RRA 1976 remained in
force until replaced by the EqA 2010.
The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) took over from the
Race Relations Board, with a remit to oversee the operation of the
RRA 1976. The CRE has now been replaced by the Equality and
Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The CRE issued various Codes
of Practice under the RRA 1976. These have been replaced by single
codes applying to all the protected characteristics and are referred to
elsewhere in this book.
In 2000, the European Council issued a Directive on Equal
Treatment Between Persons Irrespective of Racial or Ethnic
Origins.67 This is known as the ‘Race Directive’, ‘Race
Discrimination Directive’ or the ‘Race Equal Treatment Directive’.
For the relationship between EU and national law and the effect of
Brexit, see chapter 3 above. In the 2018 calendar year, 3,324 race
discrimination claims were started.68 From December 2021,
practitioners can apply to the EHRC for financial support for cases
tackling race discrimination.

The protected characteristic of race
14.68

14.69

Under EqA 2010 s9, ‘race’ is one of the protected characteristics
and includes colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins. These
terms appeared in the RRA 1976 and have been explained further by
the case-law.
There are seven essential characteristics which a group must have
to fall within the meaning of ‘ethnic group’ under the EqA 2010.69 In
summary, these are:
1) a long shared history;
2) its own cultural tradition;
3) a common language;
4) literature;
5) religion;
6) a common geographical origin; and
7) being a minority or oppressed group within a larger community.

14.70

14.71

14.72

14.73

It does not matter if the size of a particular ethnic group has
diminished due to intermarriage or lapsed observance, provided
there remains a discernible minority.70
Jewish and Sikh people are considered ‘ethnic groups’ and
therefore within the protected characteristic of ‘race’, but
Rastafarian71 and Muslim72 people are not. However, they all fall
within the EqA 2010 under the protected characteristic of ‘religion’
(see above). Roma people and Irish Travellers are also ‘ethnic
groups’. Discrimination against ‘Travellers’ generally may refer to
all those of a nomadic way of life but could amount to indirect
discrimination against those of Romany origin.73 Discrimination
because of ethnic origin also includes discrimination because of a
worker’s descent or lineage.74
The meaning of ‘national origins’ is ambiguous. Does it mean a
worker’s nationality at birth, when that has changed? Or does it mean
the nationality of the parents or grandparents of a British worker? Or
is it entirely separate from the concept of nationality? The Court of
Session has suggested that it includes ‘nations’ with a historical or
geographical meaning but which cannot confer citizenship as such, eg
a worker discriminated against specifically as English, although s/he
is a British national.75
A British national from Northern Ireland who is discriminated
against on the ground of being ‘Irish’ is covered by the EqA 2010.76
English-speaking Welsh people are not considered a different racial
group from Welsh-speaking Welsh people.77 If a worker is
discriminated against in England, for example, because s/he is from
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, s/he should probably claim
race discrimination on grounds of national origins as opposed to
nationality or ethnic origin.78 Vulnerable immigration status is not
protected in itself because it does not exactly equate with nationality.
Many non-British nationals living and working in Britain do not have
vulnerable immigration status.79
For the purposes of the EqA 2010, a particular racial group may
comprise two or more distinct racial groups.80 For example, a
person of Cypriot nationality could claim s/he has suffered

14.74

discrimination not only as a Cypriot, but as a non-British national or
(in the past) as someone not of EU nationality.81
Under EqA 2010 s9(5) there is a power for ministers to issue
regulations to include caste within the definition of ‘race’. The
decision whether to do this was originally made dependent on
evidence that came to light in a government-sponsored survey
conducted by the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research. This reported in December 2012, finding evidence of
various kinds of caste discrimination and harassment. For some time,
the government resisted calls from the EHRC and various campaign
groups to make caste discrimination unlawful. Eventually the
government was pressurised by the House of Lords into amending
section 9(5) so as to make it compulsory to issue regulations
prohibiting caste discrimination, but no timescale was fixed.82 In
March 2017, the government issued a consultation reopening the
question whether caste discrimination should be explicitly included
in the EqA 2010 or left to the case-law. In July 2018, the government
announced its decision not to legislate on the basis that few cases
have occurred and it is difficult to arrive at a definition for ‘caste’.83
It prefers to leave it to the case-law to bring caste within the
definition of ‘ethnic origins’ (as below). Many commentators do now
feel that caste discrimination can already be challenged within the
definition of ‘race’ in that it amounts to discrimination by reason of
descent (see para 14.70). Interestingly, the UN’s International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, ratified by the UK in 1969, defines racial
discrimination as including descent. A UN general comment states
that discrimination based on ‘descent’ includes discrimination
against members of communities based on forms of social
stratification such as caste and analogous systems of inherited
status.84 The EAT has said in the only test case so far that EqA 2010
s9 does not currently cover ‘caste’ but there may be factual
circumstances where the term ‘caste’ applies, and which come
within the term ‘ethnic origins’ in that the group is determined in part
by descent and is of a sufficient quality to be described as ‘ethnic’.85

Direct race discrimination
Overview
14.75

14.76

The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. An example of direct race discrimination
would be if an employer gave a black worker a final written warning
for reading football websites in work time, but did not discipline a
white worker for the same offence. If the employer could not provide
an innocent explanation, this would suggest the reason for the less
favourable treatment was the worker’s colour.
Segregating a worker from others because of his/her race is also
direct race discrimination.86
Not the worker’s own race

14.77

As explained in chapter 13, it is unlawful to directly discriminate
against a worker because of the race of someone else. For example,
a white worker is excluded from outings entertaining clients because
s/he has a black boyfriend/girlfriend, or is refused promotion
because s/he is friendly with black members of staff. It is also
unlawful to treat a worker less favourably because s/he refuses to
discriminate against black customers. However, this principle does
not extend to making it unlawful to take account of racial
considerations in all situations. For example, it is not in itself direct
race discrimination for an employer to dismiss a worker for racially
abusing a colleague or customer because of their race.87

Indirect race discrimination
14.78

The definition of indirect discrimination is explained in chapter 13.
An example of indirect race discrimination would be if an employer
required job candidates to speak fluent English. This would
disadvantage those born and brought up in non-English speaking
countries. It is unlikely to be justifiable unless fluent English was
needed for the job.

The type of PCPs which commonly cause indirect race
discrimination are listed in appendix B. PCPs to watch out for
include language requirements, qualifications, experience, duration
or area of residence.
Certain dress requirements and other rules which indirectly
discriminate because of religion may also amount to indirect race
discrimination. Before religious discrimination was made unlawful
in 2003, it was important that such claims could be brought as
indirect race discrimination. For example:

14.79

14.80

•

a rule against wearing turbans may indirectly discriminate against Sikhs;

•

a requirement that a manager work on Saturdays may indirectly discriminate against
Jewish workers;88

•

a rule that no holidays are taken over summer peak periods and therefore not on Eid may
indirectly discriminate against workers of Asian national origin.89

Harassment: race
14.81

The general law on harassment in respect of all characteristics is set
out at para 13.81 onwards. In the context of the protected
characteristic of race, harassment could include racist remarks
directed towards a worker because of his/her own race or made in
the worker’s presence about other workers of a different race.

Migrant workers
General treatment at work
14.82

Where migrant workers are permitted to work in the UK, they have
the same protection against discrimination as everyone else. They
also have the same entitlement to other employment rights. In some
situations, employers may deprive migrant workers of basic rights
such as the minimum wage or rest breaks and limits on working
hours under the Working Time Regulations 1998 on an assumption
that they are less aware of their rights or less able to take them up
than British nationals.90 However, it is uncertain whether a race
discrimination claim can be brought on these grounds (as well as any

claims under the relevant legislation such as the National Minimum
Wage Act 1998). If the tribunal finds that the mistreatment is due to
the claimant’s vulnerable immigration status, that does not in itself
amount to direct race discrimination.91 It is necessary to bring
evidence to show the less favourable treatment is because of the
worker’s particular nationality or race as opposed to his/her
‘vulnerability’. This is clearly a severe gap in the law, especially
where migrant workers are victims of trafficking or modern slavery.
Getting work – consequence of immigration rules
14.83

14.84

The rules making employers liable for employing illegal workers
may have repercussions for non-British workers who are entitled to
work. The Code of practice on preventing illegal working: civil
penalty scheme for employers (1 July 2021) sets out very clearly
what employers are expected to do.92 Basically, employers may be
liable for a substantial civil penalty in respect of every illegal
migrant they have employed unless they have a ‘statutory excuse’
defence, ie they have taken the correct steps to verify and keep
copies of relevant documentation (passports, work permits,
residence cards etc). An online right-to-work check can now be
carried out in most circumstances. A pre-employment check must be
carried out before work starts, and a further check when any timelimited right to work expires. It may well be race discrimination to
make assumptions about who needs to prove their right to work and
who does not. Employers are therefore advised to check everyone’s
documents at the point of recruitment. The Code also sets out details
of temporary changes to the method of conducting checks from 30
March 2020 to 31 August 2021 (extended to 5 April 2022) because
of the Covid-19 pandemic.93 The Home Office has issued a statutory
Code of Practice, which may be taken into account in any tribunal
race discrimination claim: Code of practice for employers:
avoiding unlawful discrimination while preventing illegal working
(May 2014). The Code is available on the GOV.UK website.94
Immigration law is beyond the scope of this book, but there are
other occasions where it interrelates with employment rights. There

have been a number of cases where an employer has dismissed an
employee who is actually entitled to work, because the employee has
not produced the supporting documentation fast enough when
requested. This cannot be a fair dismissal for ‘breach of statutory
restriction’, whatever the employer reasonably and genuinely
believes, because there is in fact no breach. It could potentially be a
fair dismissal for ‘some other substantial reason’, but the employer
will need good evidence to show s/he was acting reasonably in such
circumstances.95 Moreover, it may be unlawful race discrimination
to refuse to employ a worker who needs a work permit on a mere
assumption that the Home Office would be unlikely to grant a work
permit.96 Equally, it may be race discrimination to avoid employing
workers of certain nationalities altogether on the assumption that
there will be difficulties regarding their work status. For the position
on transfers of businesses under the TUPE Regulations 2006,97 see
para 10.53.
Illegal contracts
14.85

If a migrant worker knows s/he does not have the right to enter or
work in the UK under the immigration rules, s/he will probably be
working illegally. S/he may well be unable to claim unfair dismissal
or any other employment rights based on the contract of employment.
However, if the employee is not culpable, eg s/he is a vulnerable
foreign national who has been brought to the UK for exploitation,
s/he may still be able to make such claims.98 Where the worker has
been a victim of trafficking,99 it may also be useful in relevant
circumstances to refer to the Council of Europe Convention on
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. Article 15 says that
victims of trafficking must have the right to civil compensation. It
could be argued that this is only realistically available in an
employment tribunal and rules about illegal contracts should not
stand in the way. It is also worth noting that legal aid may be
available for cases brought by victims of trafficking and modern
slavery if they have victim status under the National Referral
Mechanism.100 The position with illegal contracts in discrimination

claims is sometimes easier as they are not directly based on the
contract of employment, but it is still not straightforward.101

Exceptions
Occupational requirements
14.86

The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected
characteristics is set out in chapter 13. For example, a council could
decide to recruit a worker of Somali origin to visit older people
from the Somali community in their homes to encourage them to take
up health services. This would probably be allowed because it
would be necessary for the post-holder to have good knowledge of
Somali language and culture if the council does not have a Somali
worker already in post who could take up the duties.102

Religion or belief
Historical and European contexts
14.87

14.88

As mentioned above, in 2000, the European Council issued a
Directive Establishing a General Framework for Equal Treatment in
Employment and Occupation.103 This ‘General Framework
Directive’ forbids discrimination in employment on grounds of
sexual orientation, religion, disability and age. In order to implement
the directive in respect of religion and belief, the Employment
Equality (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003104 came into force
on 1 December 2003. These have since been replaced by the EqA
2010. For an introduction to the effect of Brexit on the applicability
of EU law, see chapter 3 above.
In the financial year 2020/21, 733 religious or belief
discrimination claims were started.105 ACAS has issued some very
practical Guidance: Religion or belief discrimination: key points
for the workplace (August 2018), although it has no formal legal
status.106

The protected characteristic of religion and belief

Religion and belief are protected characteristics under EqA 2010
s10. These include a lack of religion or belief.107 ‘Belief’ means any
religious or philosophical belief.108 The EHRC Employment Code
says at paras 2.43–2.54 that ‘religion’ includes the more commonly
recognised religions in the UK such as the Baha’I faith, Buddhism,
Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Rastafarianism,
Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism. However, a religion need not be
mainstream or well known to gain protection, as long as it has a
clear structure and belief system. Other ancient religions, eg Druidry,
Paganism and Wicca, as well as fringe religions and membership of
religious cults, would also seem to be covered, as is membership of
the Spiritualist Church.109
Originally the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief)
Regulations 2003 referred to ‘religious or similar philosophical
belief’ (emphasis added). In 2007, this was amended to remove the
word ‘similar’. The current definition in EqA 2010 also omits this
word. The government insisted that the word ‘similar’ was
superfluous and its removal had no significance, but it did open the
way for a wider interpretation of ‘belief’. Philosophical belief
discrimination is no less protected than religious discrimination.
Philosophical beliefs may be just as fundamental or integral to a
person’s individuality and daily life as are religious beliefs.110
Philosophical belief cannot be a matter of casual opinion. The key
case of Grainger plc and others v Nicholson111 set out guidelines
for deciding whether a belief is covered by the EqA 2010, ie:

14.89

14.90

14.91

i)

The belief must be genuinely held.

ii)

It must be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of
information available.

iii)

It must be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour.

iv)

It must attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance.

v)

It must be worthy of respect in a democratic society, be not incompatible with human
dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.

The requirements should not be set at too high a level. ‘Substantial’
in guideline iii) just means ‘not trivial’. ‘Cohesion’ in guideline iv)

14.92

14.93

14.94

simply means intelligible and capable of being understood.112 In
arriving at these guidelines, the EAT considered case-law under the
ECHR, particularly Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and
religion) and Article 2 of Protocol 1.113
The nature of an individual’s beliefs in any particular case need to
be considered. However, beliefs in pacifism, vegetarianism, ethical
veganism,114 total abstinence from alcohol, environmentalism115 and
humanism are potentially covered. It does not matter whether the
philosophical belief is based on science as opposed to religion, eg a
belief in Darwinism.116 Membership or non-membership of the
Masons may also be considered a belief.117 A belief in a political
philosophy or doctrine could constitute a belief covered by the EqA
2010, eg a belief in the philosophies of Socialism, Marxism,
Communism or free-market Capitalism.118 Mere affiliation with or
belief in a political party is unlikely to be covered, as distinct from a
belief in a political philosophy aligned with such a party.119
It does not matter that no one else shares the religious or
philosophical belief in question.120 A religious belief can be
intensely personal and subjective. As long as a belief is asserted in
good faith, it need not be shared by others for it to be a religious
belief, nor need it be a mandatory requirement of an established
religion. For example, a Christian worker may believe she ought to
wear a cross visibly over her clothing, even though she knows it is
not required by scripture or as an article of faith.121
In general, people are allowed to believe what they like, however
offensive, shocking or even disturbing to others. Criterion v) above
from the Grainger case would therefore only exclude the most
extreme beliefs akin to Nazism or totalitarianism.122 There was much
recent publicity surrounding the Forstater case, where the EAT said
that belief that sex was immutable and binary (sometimes known as
gender-critical belief) was a protected belief. However, the fact that
a religion or belief is protected is not the end of the story. In
Forstater, the EAT was at pains to stress that it does not mean those
with gender-critical beliefs can indiscriminately and gratuitously
refer to trans people in terms other than they would wish. Depending

on the circumstances, such conduct could be discrimination against
or harassment of a trans person. Most religion or belief
discrimination claims depend not so much on whether the religion or
belief is protected, but on whether the employer’s treatment of the
worker is discriminatory. That is a different – and difficult –
question, as is discussed below.

Direct religion or belief discrimination
14.95

14.96

14.97

The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. Direct discrimination is where the
worker is treated less favourably because of religion or belief. It
includes situations where the discriminator is of the same religion as
the worker, but discriminates against the worker because of the
latter’s lack of religious belief on an aspect of an otherwise shared
faith.123 The EqA 2010 also covers discrimination against a worker
because of someone else’s religion or belief (or lack of religion or
belief), eg because the worker has Muslim friends or because s/he
refuses to carry out an employer’s instruction to discriminate against
Muslims. However, the EAT has said that the EqA 2010 does not
cover discrimination against a worker because of the discriminator’s
own religion or belief.124
There is a difference between where a worker is less favourably
treated simply because s/he holds or manifests a protected belief,
and where s/he is less favourably treated because s/he has
manifested the belief in some objectionable way. The latter is not
direct religion or belief discrimination because the employer’s
reason for acting is the objectionable manifestation, eg removing a
non-executive director of an NHS Trust from post because he
expressed views on the national media which risked putting off gay
people with mental health difficulties from using the Trust’s
services.125
There have been cases where workers have been dismissed
because they have expressed religious views uninvited to serviceusers or customers of the employer. Such dismissals will not

14.98

necessarily be unfair where workers have been warned of the
organisation’s policy and there is a good reason for it. It is also
unlikely to be religious discrimination unless the employer would not
have dismissed a worker of a different religion or no religion in
equivalent circumstances. Dismissing a worker for promoting his/her
religion is not direct religious discrimination in itself. There is a
distinction between manifestation of a religious belief and
inappropriate promotion of that belief.126
Obviously, restricting freedom of speech about deeply held beliefs
cannot be done lightly, and whether it is justified depends on the
facts. But under both the EqA 2010 and the ECHR, the freedom to
express religious or other beliefs cannot be unlimited. There are
circumstances in which it is right to expect those who work for an
institution, especially in a high-profile position, to accept some
limitations on how they express their beliefs in public on particularly
sensitive matters.127

Indirect religion or belief discrimination
The definition of indirect discrimination is set out in respect of all
the protected characteristics in chapter 13. Any unjustifiable
restriction on religious practices, eg dress requirements or Sabbath
working, may be indirect religious discrimination.128
14.100
To prove indirect discrimination, a worker only needs to prove
s/he was manifesting his/her religion and not that s/he was actually at
a disadvantage because s/he believed s/he must follow the practice
required.129 S/he does, however, need to show some level of group
disadvantage, ie that the employer’s rules disadvantage not only
him/her but also some others of the same religion or belief. This may
be a problem where the worker holds a very subjective and personal
belief which is not strictly speaking part of the requirements of
his/her religion. For example, in Eweida, a Christian worker
believed she should wear a cross visibly over her clothes, but was
unable to prove that other Christians would hold the same views. It
would not be enough if she could find one or two other like-minded
souls who shared this belief. It must be possible to make some
14.99

general statements which would be true about a religious group such
that an employer ought reasonably to be able to appreciate that any
particular PCP may have disparate adverse impact on the group. It is
necessary to find some identifiable section of the workforce, even a
small one, which would suffer the same disadvantage as the
claimant.130 Despite the subsequent decision of the ECtHR in
Eweida,131 where for the purposes of deciding if Ms Eweida’s
human rights were breached, it was not necessary to prove group
disadvantage, the Court of Appeal has said it is not possible to
interpret the EqA 2010 to avoid this requirement in an indirect
discrimination claim.132
14.101
If a worker does prove individual and group disadvantage, the
burden of proof will shift to the employer to justify applying the PCP
as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Although
generally the more people who would be affected by a PCP, the
harder it is to justify, this is not the case where a worker’s right to
manifest his/her religion under ECHR Article 9 applies. This is
because the justification defence under the EqA 2010 must be read
compatibly with Article 9. What matters is weighing up the worker’s
rights against the employer’s legitimate aims. Paradoxically, it may
even help the worker if few others would be affected by the PCP
because his/her religious belief is unusual, since it might be easier
for an employer to accommodate the worker if there are only a few
other employees holding the belief than a large number.133
14.102
There can be difficulties where a worker does not want to perform
certain duties because of his/her religion and this clashes with the
rights of other protected groups, eg women or gay workers. Where a
public employer wants to promote equal opportunities in its
services, it may well be justifiable indirect discrimination for it to
dismiss a worker who refuses to provide certain services, such as
civil partnership ceremonies, for religious reasons.134 Similarly, a
provider of counselling services is likely to be justified in
dismissing a worker who will not provide sexual counselling to
same-sex couples.135 Unless evidence shows otherwise, it is also
unlikely to be direct discrimination, because the employer would

probably also have dismissed someone not of that religion who
similarly refused to provide the services in question.

Harassment: religion or belief
14.103 Harassment in relation to all the protected characteristics is set out

from para 13.81 onwards. In relation to religion and belief, the
ACAS Guidance says it can include bullying, nicknames, threats,
intrusive or inappropriate questions, insults, excluding someone,
unwanted jokes and/or gossip. It is no defence to say the behaviour
was unintended or that the comments were ‘banter’.
14.104
Harassment may not be targeted at the individual but may consist
of a general culture, eg which tolerates the telling of religious jokes.
The harassment need not be because of the worker’s own religion or
belief; it can be because of that of a friend, relative or work
colleague. Examples of harassment, deliberate or unintentional,
could be:
•

anti-Muslim remarks or so-called ‘jokes’ and ‘banter’ referring to terrorist attacks, or
demonstrating general prejudice towards Muslims as a group (Islamophobia);

•

allowing excessive expression of overt football allegiances where these are a proxy for
sectarian rivalry, eg as may happen in Glasgow as between Celtic and Rangers fans;

•

harassing Jewish workers because of their (perceived) support for Israel; allowing hostility
towards the State of Israel to develop into an atmosphere of anti-Semitism;136

•

a devout Christian haranguing colleagues for being insufficiently religious.

Exceptions: Where religion or belief discrimination is
allowed
Occupational requirements
14.105 The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected

characteristics is set out in chapter 13.
Religious ethos
14.106 An employer with an ethos based on religion or belief may require a

worker to be of a particular religion or belief if the employer can

prove that, having regard to that ethos and to the nature or context of
the work:
•

it is an occupational requirement;

•

the application of the requirement is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim;
and

•

the worker does not meet that requirement (or the employer has reasonable grounds for not
being satisfied that the worker meets it).137

14.107 This exception applies to discrimination in recruitment arrangements

and job offers, access to promotion, transfer or training or any other
benefit, facility or service, and dismissal. The need for the
requirement to be ‘proportionate’ suggests that whereas, eg a Roman
Catholic school may be able to insist on its teachers being Roman
Catholic, it may not be able to so insist with cleaners or gardeners.

Special situations
Dress codes and appearance
14.108 The ACAS Guidance has a section on dress code and appearance.

Many religions have obligations in terms of dress and appearance.
How people dress will depend on their level of observance.
Examples of religious dress are as follows:
•

As part of the five Ks of their faith, strictly practising male Sikhs do not shave or cut their
hair, which is covered with a turban. They wear a ‘Kara’ (metal bracelet) and a ‘Kirpan’
(short ceremonial sword under clothing).

•

Many Sikh women cover their hair with a scarf (‘dupattah’ or ‘chooni’).

•

Rastafarians wear uncut hair, plaited into dreadlocks. They often wear a hat (usually red,
gold and green).

•

Muslim men usually wear western shirts and trousers (not shorts), though a few may wear
traditional dress. Some men will keep their heads covered at all times. Many Muslim men
also grow a beard, which is considered obligatory within some schools of thought.

•

Muslim women may dress modestly, covering arms and legs. Some may wear a ‘hijab’
(headscarf). More unusually, in some communities, women may wear a ‘burqa’ or
‘chador’, which covers them from head to ankle and conceals the shape of their body.
Muslims may wear jewellery signifying marriage or religious devotion.

•

Many Hindu women wear modest dress, covering their legs, eg a sari or top over loose
trousers. They often wear a ‘bindi’ (a red dot on the forehead). Many married women
wear a necklace (‘mangal sutra’) or other wedding jewellery, eg bangles or nose rings, as
well as a wedding ring.

•

Some Hindu men wear a small tuft of hair (‘shikha’) similar to a ponytail, although this is
often hidden under the remaining hair.

•

Orthodox Jewish men keep their head covered at all times, usually wearing a skullcap
(‘kappel’, ‘kippah’ or ‘yarmulke’). Orthodox women will dress modestly, avoiding trousers
or short sleeves and skirts. They may cover their heads with a scarf.

14.109 Differential

rules may amount to direct discrimination, eg if the
employer allows a Jewish man to wear a kappel but does not allow a
Muslim woman to wear a headscarf (or vice versa). If an employer
applies a general rule that, eg, no one can wear a head covering
(whether for religious reasons or otherwise), there is unlikely to be
direct discrimination.
14.110
Employers imposing rigid dress codes forbidding jewellery,
headwear, beards or long hair for men, or who impose uniforms with
short sleeves or skirts, may indirectly discriminate against members
of certain religious groups. Whether or not it is unlawful will usually
depend on the employer’s reason for imposing the rule. Reasons such
as safety or hygiene are the most likely justification, but there are
non-discriminatory ways around most difficulties. In one wellpublicised case,138 the EAT upheld an ET decision that it was
justifiable to require a bilingual support worker to remove her veil
when teaching school pupils, so that children could receive optimal
communication from visual clues. This is not to say that an employer
could justify refusing to allow the veil in other jobs. Headscarves
are a different matter and it is hard to think of many jobs where a
prohibition would be justifiable. Although the CJEU recently stated
that it would be justifiable for an employer to tell a Muslim woman
she could not wear a veil in a public-facing role as part of a crossthe-board ‘neutrality’ policy applied for business reasons, this was
in relation to employment in Belgium and France.139 In the UK, there
is not the same tradition of secularism in the public arena. Moreover,
the weight given to business reasons as a justification is contrary to

the ruling of the ECtHR in Eweida (see para 14.100). Note that the
Employment Act 1989 exempts turban-wearing Sikhs from any
statutory requirements to wear safety helmets at work. This exception
must not be taken as discrimination against any non-Sikh. It is also
unjustifiable indirect discrimination for an employer to insist that a
Sikh wear a safety helmet, provided the employer has no reasonable
grounds for believing the person would not wear a turban at work at
all times. These exceptions do not apply if the Sikh is working in an
occupation involving response to fire, riot or other hazardous
situations.140 For the position regarding the wearing of a veil in a
tribunal hearing, see para 21.79.
Prayer breaks
14.111 Observant Muslims need to pray five times per day at fixed times.

The times are: dawn; just after midday; mid-afternoon; immediately
after sunset; and at night, just before going to bed. The number of
occasions which fall at work therefore depends on the worker’s
shifts and the season. The prayer breaks take about ten minutes on
each occasion, the same time it may take any worker to make coffee,
have a chat or go to the toilet. Devout Hindus may also pray three
times per day: at sunrise, noon and sunset.
14.112
Unjustified refusal to allow time off to pray will be indirect
discrimination. It is difficult to see how such a refusal could be
justified, although if the employer refuses to allow any workers to
take breaks of any kind, the worker may have to offer to make up the
time. It is helpful that a worker is entitled to at least one 20-minute
break away from the work station after six hours under the Working
Time Regulations 1998 (see para 4.84). If the employer allows other
workers to take breaks for different reasons, eg cigarette breaks,
refusal of a prayer break may also be direct discrimination.
14.113
Employers are probably not required to provide a prayer room,
but if there is an available quiet space, it would almost certainly be
discriminatory not to allow the worker to use it. The ACAS
Guidance makes some recommendations about enabling prayer at
pages 14–15.

Sabbath working
14.114 Workers

may need certain days off for religious holidays (para
14.116) or because of the Sabbath. The Muslim holy day is Friday
and many Muslim men try to attend midday prayer at a mosque every
Friday. For Jewish people, the Sabbath (‘Shabbat’) is Saturday, but
it starts at sundown on Friday. Observant Jews must arrive at home
before Sabbath begins, which means leaving work in the early
afternoon during winter. A requirement to work Friday, Saturday or
Sunday may therefore indirectly discriminate against certain
workers. Whether or not such a requirement is justifiable is likely to
depend on the nature of the job and whether other arrangements can
be made.141
14.115
There are also long-standing rules under the Employment Rights
Act (ERA) 1996, allowing shop and betting workers to refuse to
work on Sundays (see para 6.97).
Religious holidays and time off
14.116 Every religion has a range of holidays of varying importance. Each

individual will have his/her own feelings as to which holidays s/he
feels obliged to observe. Very often the holidays are part of a
cultural as well as a religious tradition, and there are social and
family pressures to observe the day, even if the individual is not
particularly religious. The dates of the holidays can be hard to
ascertain in advance, as many follow the lunar year. Jewish holidays
start at sundown the previous evening. Advance dates of Jewish
holidays can be found on specialist websites.142
14.117
Some religious holidays are as follows:
•

The two most important festivals for Muslims are Eid-al-Fitr, which marks the end of
Ramadan; and Eid-al-Adha, of which the exact date depends on a sighting of the new
moon and is not known far in advance. ‘Eid’ means festival. Muslim workers would need
at least one day off on each occasion to celebrate appropriately.

•

Major Hindu festivals include Divali (or Deepavali) in October/November; which marks the
end of the Hindu year; Holi (in February/March); Raksha bandhan (in August); and
Navratri (in September/October).

•

The main Sikh festivals include the Birthday of Guru Nanak (in October/November);
Vaisakhi, the New Year festival, normally on 13 April; and Bandhi Chhord
(October/November), at the same time as Divali – many Sikhs celebrate both.

•

There are 13 key days which a minority of observant Jews would follow. The most
important and universally observed dates requiring time off work are Yom Kippur (the Day
of Atonement) and Rosh Hashannah (the New Year). These fall in September/October.
Pesach (or Passover), near Easter, and Chanukah, near Christmas, are also commonly
celebrated. Other holidays include Sukkot, Shavuot and Tish’ah B’av.

•

Greek Orthodox Easter is a different date from that usually observed for Easter by other
Christian religions.

14.118 Not

all religious holidays require time off work, but most do.
Difficulties arise when employers object to granting time off, saying
that the worker has benefited from time off over Christmas and
Easter. This is rather unfair when such holidays are traditional bank
holidays for all workers regardless of their religion. In most
circumstances, refusal to allow the worker time off for a religious
holiday would be discriminatory. It should not be underestimated
how important many of these religious holidays are to the individual
and his/her family. The question is whether the time should be paid
or unpaid, or whether it should come out of the worker’s annual
holiday entitlement. Legally, this is difficult to answer. Requiring the
time to come out of existing holiday entitlement is arguably indirect
discrimination, because the worker is disadvantaged by using up one
of his/her holiday days to meet religious obligations, which may not
even be of a recreational or festive nature (eg a fast day). It all
depends on whether a tribunal would think such an arrangement was
justifiable. The best solution may be to allow paid leave. Arguably
this discriminates against those who are not of a religion requiring
additional holidays, but it is doubtful this is a comparable situation.
It is thoughtless, unfair and possibly discriminatory to fix social
events, important meetings or one-off training on important religious
holidays. Dates should routinely be checked in advance.

Religion, belief and human rights
14.120 Under the HRA 1998, the tribunals and higher courts must interpret

the EqA 2010 so far as is possible to give effect to the rights
imposed by the articles of the ECHR.145 Articles 9 (freedom of
thought, conscience and religion) and 10 (freedom of expression) are
particularly relevant to religion and belief discrimination. Article 11
(the right to freedom of association with others) may also be
relevant. In recent years there has been a few religion and belief
cases taken directly to the ECtHR in Strasbourg where employees
have lost their discrimination claims in the domestic courts.146 This
is really only a practical option where there is financial backing
from some kind of organisation or campaign group.
14.121
Article 9 says that everyone has the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion, and to manifest their religion or belief in
public or private in worship, teaching, practice and observance. Not
every action which is inspired, motivated or influenced by a religion
or belief constitutes a ‘manifestation’ of it. The act in question must
be ‘intimately linked’ to the religion or belief. There needs to be ‘a
sufficiently close and direct nexus between the act and the underlying
belief’.147
14.122
The freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs is a qualified
right, ie under Article 9(2) it is subject to such limitations as are
prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the
interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or
morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
14.123
The most notable religion and belief case decided in recent years
by the ECtHR was brought jointly by four Christian employees:
Eweida, Chaplin, Ladele and McFarlane.148 All of these had
ultimately lost their claims in the UK courts for indirect religious
discrimination under the EqA 2010 because the employers’

requirements had been found to be justifiable.149 However, Ms
Eweida had primarily lost because she could not prove any group
disadvantage, ie although she was personally disadvantaged because
she was not allowed to wear a cross visibly over her uniform, she
was unable to prove that any other Christians would take that as a
disadvantage.
14.124
The ECtHR considered whether there was a breach of Article 9.
The issue of group disadvantage did not arise because of the
different wording of Article 9 compared with the stages of indirect
discrimination under the EqA 2010 (see comments at para 14.100).
Under Article 9, the key questions were whether the employees were
‘manifesting’ their beliefs and if so, whether interference with their
right to do so was allowed under the wording of Article 9(2). The
ECtHR rejected the approach it had taken in the past, which said that
if there is a problem reconciling working hours with religious belief,
a worker can simply find alternative employment.150
14.125
The ECtHR upheld Ms Eweida’s claim, essentially because it
thought the UK courts had given too much weight to the employer’s
(British Airways (BA)) reasons (corporate image) for not letting her
wear her cross. The cross was discreet, it did not detract from
corporate image, and anyway, BA had allowed others to wear
turbans and hijabs, and it had subsequently decided to amend its
uniform code, which showed the rule had not been of crucial
importance. By contrast, the ECtHR thought the UK courts were
entitled to say the employer was justified in insisting Ms Chaplin
remove her cross because of health and safety risks on a hospital
ward.
14.126
As for Ms Ladele and Mr Macfarlane, the employers were also
justified in their actions. The UK courts had a great deal of
discretion in striking a balance between competing Convention
rights, and it was important to avoid discrimination against people
because of their sexual orientation.
14.127
The ECtHR decisions in these religious cases may provide useful
guidance which can be applied to whether indirect religious
discrimination under the EqA 2010 is justified. For example, more

weight was given by the ECtHR to health and safety reasons for
imposing a uniform code than corporate image. It was also very keen
to avoid discrimination against people because of their sexual
orientation. The ECtHR also said that it is not conclusive – although
it is a factor to be considered whether a worker has taken on a job
knowing in advance of the restriction on their religious practices or
whether the issue only arises unexpectedly later.
14.128
Article 9 requires that, when assessing justification, a tribunal
should take into account the impact of the PCP on the individual. The
incorporation of this into the EqA 2010 is discussed more fully at
para 14.101. It may also be significant that, whereas indirect
discrimination law weighs the discriminatory impact against the
employer’s needs, Article 9 weighs it against the needs of the
community generally. It seems that there must be a slight shift in
emphasis in any evaluation under the EqA 2010 if a worker’s human
rights are to form part of the equation.

Sex
Historical and European contexts
14.129 Discrimination because of sex was previously covered by the SDA

1975. Sex discrimination in pay and contract terms was dealt with by
the EqPA 1970. The EqPA 1970 was structured quite differently from
the SDA 1975. These separate structures are retained in the EqA
2010.151
14.130
Until replaced by the EHRC in October 2007, the body with a
remit to oversee the operation of the SDA 1975 and the EqPA 1970
was the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The EOC issued
various Codes of Practice under the SDA 1975. These have now
been replaced by single codes applying to all the protected
characteristics and are referred to elsewhere in this book.
14.131
The longest tradition of European discrimination law has been in
the field of sex discrimination and equal pay. The key legislation is:
•

Article 157 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 119 of
the Treaty of Rome, then Article 141), which lays down the principle of equal pay for equal

work.
•

The Recast Directive. This came into effect on 15 August 2006. Its full name is the
Directive on Equality between Men and Women in Matters of Employment and Occupation
(Recast).152 It consolidated the seven previous directives dealing with equality between
men and women in employment, including the Equal Treatment Directive153 and the Equal
Pay Directive,154 together with interpretative case-law. The individual directives which it
replaced were repealed with effect from 15 August 2009.

For an introduction to the effect of Brexit on the applicability of EU
law, see chapter 3 above.
14.132
In the financial year 2020/21, 5,172 sex discrimination claims
were started, excluding equal pay claims, but including claims for
discrimination related to marriage, civil partnership and gender
reassignment.155

The protected characteristic of sex
14.133 Under EqA 2010 s11, ‘sex’ is a protected characteristic and means

being a man or being a woman.

Direct sex discrimination
14.134 The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are

explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. Dress codes are referred to in para 13.9.
It is not sex discrimination against a man to give a woman special
treatment in connection with pregnancy or childbirth.156 However,
this only applies if the special treatment goes no further than is
reasonably necessary to compensate the woman for any disadvantage
occasioned by her being pregnant or on maternity leave.157

Indirect sex discrimination
14.135 The definition of indirect discrimination is set out in respect of all

the protected characteristics in chapter 13. Indirect sex
discrimination most commonly arises in the context of employment
requirements which interfere with childcare, eg requirements for

full-time working, flexible hours and mobility. These are discussed
in chapter 11. Note also that the Part-time Workers (Prevention of
Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 prohibit
discrimination against part-timers, regardless of their sex or marital
status.158 Length of service requirements also tend to disadvantage
women, who may build up less service due to childcare breaks.

Harassment: sex
Overview
14.136 Sexual harassment in the workplace has gained increased attention

over the past few years, partly as a result of the #MeToo movement.
In July 2018, the House of Commons Women and Equalities
Committee published a report on Sexual harassment in the
workplace159 suggesting that it is an everyday common occurrence,
with the vast majority of incidents never reported. EHRC research
has also reported on the lack of consistent effective action by too
many employers.160 The EHRC has produced Preventing sexual
harassment at work: a guide for employers (January 2020) and
Sexual harassment and harassment at work – Technical guidance
(January 2020).161 In July 2021, the government published a
response to its consultation on sexual harassment in the
workplace.162 It plans to produce guidance for employers and also to
support the EHRC in producing a statutory code of practice on sexual
harassment. The government also says it will legislate to introduce
workplace protections against third-party harassment. Nondisclosure agreements on settling tribunal claims are a particular
problem in sexual harassment cases. ACAS has published guidance
discouraging their routine use.163 On a different but related topic, the
government intends to look at ways to support workers in the
workplace who have been subjected to domestic abuse.164
14.137
The law on harassment in relation to all the protected
characteristics is set out from para 13.81 onwards. There are three
definitions of harassment which can apply to gender:
a)

the general definition applicable to all protected characteristics;

and then two further definitions applicable only to sex and gender
reassignment:
b)

unwanted conduct of a sexual nature; and

c)

harassment because of rejection of submission to the conduct.

Chapter 7 of the EHRC Employment Code deals with harassment.
The general definition: conduct related to sex
14.138 The general

definition of harassment refers to unwanted conduct
related to sex which has the purpose or effect of violating the
worker’s dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
humiliating or offensive environment for the worker.165 The meaning
of this is discussed generally at para 13.81 onwards, which should
be read first.
Conduct of a sexual nature

14.139 The second definition of harassment is unwanted conduct of a sexual

nature which has the same purpose or effect as in the general
definition.166 This definition obviously overlaps to a large extent
with the general definition. The EHRC Employment Code says
conduct of a sexual nature can cover verbal, non-verbal or physical
conduct including unwelcome sexual advances, touching, forms of
sexual assault, sexual jokes, displaying pornographic pictures or
sending emails with material of a sexual nature.167
14.140
As already discussed at para 13.91, where the conduct is not done
with the purpose of violating the worker’s dignity etc, it will still be
unlawful if it has that effect. However, in the latter case, it is not
simply a question of whether the worker felt his/her dignity violated
etc. It is also a question of whether it is reasonable for the conduct to
have that effect, taking account of the circumstances as well as the
worker’s own perception.168 This rather controversial test is
designed to prevent situations where a ‘hypersensitive’ worker might
be upset by something which no one else would consider to be
offensive in any way.

There have been few reported cases regarding when it would be
‘reasonable’ for sexual harassment to have the unlawful effect on the
worker. Most of the case-law was decided before the specific
definition of harassment was introduced into the SDA 1975, at a time
when harassment needed to fit within the definition of direct
discrimination causing an unlawful detriment. Many of the principles
in those earlier cases would still apply, but it is important always to
remember the difference in the wording of the definitions, the fact
that the specific offence of harassment is more widely defined than
direct discrimination, and also the difference in the definition
between cases where the harasser’s purpose was to cause the
unlawful effect and those where it was not.
14.142
With that cautionary note, some of the older cases regarding what
amounts to a ‘detriment’ may be useful when considering what kind
of conduct a tribunal would think a worker was reasonable to be
upset by. A single incident of harassment can amount to a detriment
‘provided it is sufficiently serious’. A one-off racist or sexist remark
can be made worse by the surrounding circumstances, eg an
offensive or demeaning sexual comment made by a junior employee
to a supervisor in front of others could be unlawful.169 Where there
is a series of incidents, it is important not to look at each one
separately, since there can be a cumulative effect which exceeds the
sum of each incident.170 Incidents trivial in themselves can acquire a
measure of seriousness if they appear to be recurrent.171 Once a man
has shown unwelcome sexual interest in a female employee, other
incidents which would normally appear quite unobjectionable, eg
asking to look at personal photographs, can take on a different
significance.172
14.141

Unwanted
14.143 A

big issue which tends to arise in harassment cases, and
particularly acutely on sexual harassment claims, is whether the
conduct was indeed ‘unwanted’. It may be easier for a woman to
prove it was unwanted if she objected at the time, but there are many
reasons why she may not have done so.173

Harassment because of rejection of or submission to the
conduct
14.144 The third definition of harassment is where the worker is treated less

favourably because s/he rejected or submitted to unwanted conduct
of a sexual nature or that is related to gender reassignment or sex.174

Exceptions
Occupational requirements
14.145 The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected

characteristics is set out in chapter 13, though in relation to sex, it
does not cover dismissal. Occupational requirements may be used to
preserve decency and privacy, eg a gym could require a changing
room attendant to be of the same sex as the users of that room.
Similarly, a women’s refuge could require all its staff members to be
women.175
Religious requirements
14.146 An employer may apply a requirement to be of a particular sex, if

s/he can show:
•

the employment is for the purposes of an organised religion;

•

the application of the requirement engages the compliance or non-conflict principle; and

•

the worker to whom the employer applies the requirement does not meet it (or the
employer has reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the person meets it).176

The ‘compliance principle’ occurs where the requirement is applied
so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion. The ‘non-conflict
principle’ applies where, because of the nature or context of the
employment, the requirement is applied so as to avoid conflicting
with the strongly held religious views of a significant number of the
religion’s followers. For example, an orthodox synagogue could
require its rabbi to be a man. This exception should only be used for
a limited number of posts, eg ministers of religion and a small
number of other posts, including those which exist to promote or
represent the religion.177 It is unlikely to cover jobs such as cleaners,

or even teachers in religious schools. The term ‘for the purposes of
an organised religion’ does not mean ‘for the purposes of a religious
organisation’ such as a faith school.178 This exception applies to
discrimination in recruitment arrangements and job offers; access to
promotion, transfer or training or any other benefit, facility or
service; and dismissal.
Armed forces
14.147 The armed forces can require a person to be a man if that is a
proportionate means of ensuring combat effectiveness.179

The menopause and work
14.148 Despite

increased publicity over the last couple of years, the
menopause often remains a taboo subject in the workplace, with few
workplace policies covering the subject, and many women leaving
their jobs because they cannot get the adjustments they need or do not
feel able to ask. There is also evidence that where women do raise
the matter, they can frequently be met with embarrassment, ignorance,
inappropriate humour and sometimes hostility.
14.149
The menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, but
it can happen much earlier, and can typically last around four years.
There is also a period of hormonal change leading up to the
menopause known as the perimenopause, which can last several
years in itself. The majority of women are unwilling to disclose
menopause-related health problems to their managers, because of
embarrassment, fear about how they will be seen, or lack of
confidence that any help will be forthcoming. A 2019 survey
conducted by BUPA and the Chartered Institute for Personnel and
Development (CIPD) found that three in five menopausal women
were negatively affected at work, and that almost 900,000 women in
the UK left their jobs because of menopausal symptoms.180 There
have been many useful and practical guides from both sides of
industry.181 ACAS has issued guidance on the Menopause at
work.182

The menopause is not a protected characteristic under the EqA
2010 and there is no piece of employment legislation specifically
addressing it. This is the subject of some concern and in July 2021,
the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee launched
an Inquiry to consider whether enough is being done in legislation
and workplace practices.183 In the meantime, women can only use
existing employment law, most notably the law against sex, disability
and age discrimination. This is an awkward fit and does not always
match the facts and issues.
14.151
Menopause is not a disability. It is a natural life process.
However, many menopausal symptoms, when sufficiently severe, fit
the legal definition of disability in the EqA 2010. The section on the
menopause in chapter 15 sets out some of the common symptoms of
the menopause and considers how disability discrimination law may
help. The following paragraphs discuss how sex and/or age
discrimination law may apply.
14.152
It could be direct sex or age discrimination or sex or age-related
harassment:
14.150

•

to treat physical or mental health difficulties caused by the menopause less seriously or
sympathetically than equivalent ill health of a male or younger female employee, eg failing
to get an Occupational Health report;

•

to use the term menopausal as if it is some kind of insult when talking about women of a
particular age;

•

to make or allow comments such as ‘she is menopausal’ or ‘it must be that time of the
month’ when trying to suggest a woman is being irrational or difficult; but when a man
behaves that way, just saying ‘he must be having a bad day’;

•

to make constant remarks without any knowledge of a particular woman’s situation,
attributing matters to the menopause, eg when seeing an older woman sweat on a very hot
day or when wearing heavy uniform, making jokes about hot flushes;

•

not to promote or give particular projects to an older woman because of an assumption that
she is or will soon be in the menopause and will be performing poorly as a result. For
example, an older woman without menopausal symptoms reported in the Guardian that
she received comments like ‘I am worried about you because you’re in your late 40s; you
won’t be able to do the night shift because you’ll be menopausal and won’t be sleeping and
will be tired all the time’.184 Although many women are severely affected by menopausal

symptoms when at work, many others only have minor symptoms or none that cause any
notable difficulty. It can be equally discriminatory to make negative comments and
assumptions, regardless of whether a particular woman is in fact in the menopause or
having any adverse effects.
14.153

It could be indirect sex discrimination, eg unjustifiably to require
a menopausal worker to wear close-fitting, heavy or synthetic
uniform or to work in a hot environment with no fans. Dismissing a
woman because of capability or conduct issues which the woman
says relate to her menopausal symptoms, without fairly taking that
into account, may be unfair dismissal.

Sexual orientation
Historical and European contexts
14.154 In a TUC survey at the end of 1998 of 440 lesbian, gay and bisexual

(LGB) workers, 44 per cent said they had suffered discrimination at
work because of their sexuality. In the public sector trade union
UNISON’s survey in 2003, 52 per cent of its lesbian or gay members
said they had experienced harassment for that reason. Yet despite
evidence of the desperate need, no government was prepared to
legislate against such discrimination until the intervention of Europe.
A 2014 report by the Economic and Social Research Council said
that LGB people were twice as likely to be bullied at work as their
heterosexual colleagues.185 According to a 2015 report by
Stonewall, 26 per cent of LGB staff in health and social care
services said they had personally experienced bullying or poor
treatment from colleagues in the previous five years as a result of
their sexual orientation.186 A survey by the TUC in 2017 showed that
while there were some positive experiences, bullying and
harassment by colleagues, managers and customers were still rife. In
addition, 23 per cent of gay workers had been outed against their
will, 62 per cent had heard homophobic or biphobic remarks or socalled jokes directed at others and 28 per cent had had such
comments directed towards themselves. Over half of those
responding said the experience of discrimination and harassment had

affected their mental health.187 In a 2019 TUC survey, seven out of
ten LGBT workers said they had experienced at least one type of
sexual harassment at work, and almost one in eight LGBT women
reported being sexually assaulted or raped at work; black, Asian and
minority ethnic LGBT women were the most likely to be targeted.188
Workplace research shows that whether, how and when to ‘come out’
at work is difficult for LGB workers to manage for a variety of
reasons, not only because of fear of harassment, but because of
uncertainty as to what reception they might receive.189
14.155
In 2000, the European General Framework Directive190 came into
effect, prohibiting discrimination in employment on grounds of
sexual orientation as well as religion, disability and age. In order to
implement the directive in respect of sexual orientation, the
Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003191 came
into force on 1 December 2003. For the anticipated effect of Brexit
on the applicability of EU law, see chapter 3 above.
14.156
Until the EHRC came into being in 2007, there was no
organisation with a statutory remit to oversee the working of sexual
orientation discrimination law. Nor were there any statutory codes.
There is now the EHRC Employment Code which relates to all the
protected characteristics. In the financial year 2020/21, 438 sexual
orientation discrimination claims were started.192

The protected characteristic of sexual orientation
14.157 Under EqA 2010 s12, ‘sexual orientation’ is one of the protected

characteristics and means a person’s sexual orientation towards
people of the same sex, or towards those of the opposite sex or
towards people of either sex. Sexual orientation discrimination
covers discrimination against a worker because of his/her sexual
orientation. It also covers discrimination because of the
manifestation of that sexual orientation, eg a worker’s appearance,
places they visit or people they associate with.193

Direct sexual orientation discrimination

Overview
14.158 The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are

explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. When making a comparison with how an
employer treats a colleague of a different sexual orientation, it is not
a relevant difference between the circumstances of the worker and
his/her colleague that one is a civil partner or married to someone of
the same sex and the other is married to someone of the opposite
sex.194 It is not direct sexual orientation discrimination to treat
someone less favourably because they support gay marriage. Many
heterosexual people can and do also support gay marriage. The
comparison is with how the employer would treat a person who was
not gay in similar circumstances.195
Not the worker’s own sexual orientation
14.159 It is unlawful to discriminate because of a perception of the worker’s

sexual orientation, whether this is correct or false. A worker who is
discriminated against because of a false perception that s/he is gay
would therefore be protected. It also means that a worker may not
need to disclose his/her actual sexual orientation when bringing an
ET claim.196 Discrimination against a worker because of someone
else’s sexual orientation is also covered, eg because s/he has gay
friends or because s/he refuses to carry out an employer’s instruction
to discriminate against gay men or lesbians.197

Indirect sexual orientation discrimination
14.160 The definition of indirect discrimination is set out in respect of all

the protected characteristics in chapter 13.

Harassment: sexual orientation
14.161 The general law on harassment in respect of all characteristics is set

out at para 13.81 onwards. The TUC says the most common form of
discrimination faced by lesbian and gay workers is harassment, and

the majority of successful tribunal claims have concerned this.
Harassment may comprise intentional and obvious bullying, or
unintentional or subtle behaviour. It may involve nicknames, teasing,
name-calling or other behaviour which is not intended to be
malicious, but nevertheless is upsetting. It may not be targeted at the
individual but may consist of a general culture, eg which tolerates the
telling of homophobic jokes. Harassment can be based on the sexual
orientation of the worker or of someone else, eg a friend or relative.
It is also unlawful to harass someone on the misconception that they
are gay or even using homophobic abuse when knowing perfectly
well that they are not gay.198
14.162 Examples of harassment, deliberate or unintentional, could be:
•

‘outing’ (ie revealing the sexuality of) a lesbian, gay or bisexual worker for malicious
reasons or against his/her wishes;

•

spreading rumours that a gay man has HIV just because he takes sick leave or loses
weight (though one would hope this particular stereotype is less common now);

•

where lesbian, gay or bisexual workers complain of harassment, accusing them of being
oversensitive, having no sense of humour or bringing it on themselves by hiding (or
revealing) their sexual orientation.

The fact that a gay worker has ‘come out’ does not mean that remarks
or references to his/her sexuality thereafter cannot constitute
discrimination. For example, subsequent remarks could be vicious or
designed to embarrass the worker. However, it is difficult for a
worker who has come out to certain colleagues, without asking them
to keep it confidential, to say it is unlawful harassment if they then
pass on that information in a non-malicious manner to other
colleagues. Although a gay worker in that position may be upset that
s/he was unable to take control of how and when s/he came out to the
other colleagues, the definition of harassment requires more than
being upset; it requires that the worker has had his/her dignity
violated or that s/he has been subjected to an intimidating, hostile,
degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.199
14.163
When the law against sexual orientation discrimination was
introduced, much was made of the possible conflict with the law

against religious discrimination. For example, can a worker be
prevented from making homophobic observations if these are an
expression of his/her religious views? In practice, this kind of case
has rarely arisen. Making gratuitous offensive remarks is likely to be
unlawful harassment. However, although some religions have strong
views about sexual orientation, most do not advocate persecution of
people because of their sexual orientation. Everyone has the right to
be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace, whatever
his/her race, sex, age, disability, religion or sexual orientation.
Workers need not be friends, but they should treat each other
professionally. What has been a greater problem is where some
workers, because of their religious beliefs, have refused to provide
civil partnership services or sexual counselling to same sex couples.
The tribunals and appeal courts have found the dismissal of workers
refusing to provide such services is not direct religious
discrimination (where anyone else refusing to provide such services
would also be dismissed) or indirect discrimination (where it is
justifiable in view of the employer’s ethos and commitment to equal
opportunities for its client group).200

Exceptions
Occupational requirements
14.164 The occupational requirement exception applicable to all protected

characteristics is set out in chapter 13.
Religious requirements
14.165 An employer may apply a requirement related to sexual orientation,

if s/he can show:
•

the employment is for the purposes of an organised religion;

•

the application of the requirement engages the compliance or non-conflict principle; and

•

the worker to whom the employer applies the requirement does not meet it (or the
employer has reasonable grounds for not being satisfied that the person meets it).201

The ‘compliance principle’ occurs where the requirement is applied
so as to comply with the doctrines of the religion. The ‘non-conflict
principle’ applies where, because of the nature or context of the
employment, the requirement is applied so as to avoid conflicting
with the strongly held religious views of a significant number of the
religion’s followers. For example, an evangelical church could
require its ministers to be heterosexual. This exception should only
be used for a limited number of posts, eg ministers of religion and a
small number of other posts, including those which exist to promote
or represent the religion.202 It is unlikely to cover jobs such as
cleaners, or even teachers in religious schools. The term ‘for the
purposes of an organised religion’ does not mean ‘for the purposes
of a religious organisation’ such as a faith school.203 This exception
applies to discrimination in recruitment arrangements and job offers,
access to promotion, transfer or training or any other benefit, facility
or service, and dismissal.
Benefits dependent on marital status
14.166 It

is not unlawful sexual orientation discrimination to provide
married people and civil partners access to benefits, facilities or
services to the exclusion of others.204

Special considerations
14.167 Given that not all LGB workers choose to be ‘out’ to their managers,

this would have implications for the nature of workplace policies,
the purpose of monitoring, and the willingness of individuals to
complain about discrimination or harassment. In the years since
2003, many employers have taken steps to make their workplaces
more LGB-friendly. The EqA 2010 does not explicitly require
employers to monitor sexual orientation, but the Welsh and Scottish
Specific Duties require collating information on employees by
reference to all the protected characteristics. How sexual orientation
should be monitored and for what purpose are difficult questions
given that, unlike with race and gender, workers may choose to hide

their sexual orientation at work. There is guidance in the EHRC
Employment Code at paras 15–20.
14.168
The statutory entitlements to dependant, parental, adoption and
‘paternity’ leave are all available where there are same-sex partners.
Any additional benefits offered by the employer in internal policies
should state that they are equally available to same-sex partners, eg
compassionate and bereavement leave; parental and adoption leave;
carers’ leave; perks such as private healthcare insurance, free travel
and discounts on company goods. Granting benefits only to those
with heterosexual partners would probably be direct discrimination.

There is a complex definition of disability under the Equality
Act (EqA) 2010. It can often cover workers who would not be
seen by themselves or their employers as disabled, eg those
with back injuries, depression and other temporary health
problems.
It is often necessary in a case to prove a worker has a
disability even where that seems obvious.
HIV, multiple sclerosis and cancer are deemed a disability on
diagnosis. Those registered as blind or partially sighted are
also automatically covered.
Long Covid is potentially a disability, depending on its length
and severity.
Although the menopause should not be considered a disability,
menopausal symptoms can sometimes meet the legal
definition and thus gain the protection of disability
discrimination law.
Failure to make reasonable adjustment is at the heart of the
EqA 2010. Employers are expected to make risk assessments
and take proactive steps to assist a worker where reasonable
adjustment is needed.
An employer is not obliged to make reasonable adjustments if
s/he does not know and cannot reasonably be expected to
know the worker has a disability and that adjustments are
required.
Discrimination arising from disability (DAFD) involves
discrimination because of something connected with the
worker’s disability. There is a potential justification defence.
Direct discrimination means less favourable treatment
because of disability. There is no justification defence.
Indirect disability discrimination can be claimed where
applicable, though it will only rarely be needed, as the duty to

•
•

•

make reasonable adjustments covers most situations.
Victimisation is where a worker is punished for complaining
about discrimination.
Public authorities must comply with the public sector equality
duty (PSED) which includes a duty in respect of disability (see
chapter 12).
Guidance for running a discrimination case is at chapter 21.
Evidence to prove disability discrimination is in chapter 16.
Checklists are in appendix A.

Introduction
15.1

An overview of discrimination law, who is covered and the
protected characteristics are set out in chapter 12. Chapter 13
explains the definitions of the different types of discrimination. This
chapter expands on how the law applies in the case of disability. The
other protected characteristics are covered in chapter 14.

Meaning of disability
Historical and European contexts
15.2

15.3

15.4

After several attempts at private members’ bills, disability
discrimination was finally made unlawful by the Disability
Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995. The employment provisions did not
come into force until December 1996.
Until replaced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission
(EHRC) in October 2007, the body with a remit to oversee the
operation of the DDA 1995 was the Disability Rights Commission
(DRC). The DRC issued various Codes of Practice under the DDA
1995. These have now been replaced by unified codes applying to
all the protected characteristics. Most important for the purposes of
this chapter is the EHRC’s Employment Code.1
In 2000, the European Council issued a Directive Establishing a
General Framework for Equal Treatment in Employment and

15.5

15.6

Occupation.2 This is known as the ‘General Framework Directive’
or sometimes the ‘Framework Employment Directive’ or the ‘Equal
Treatment Framework Directive’. The directive forbids
discrimination in employment on grounds of disability as well as a
number of the other protected characteristics. For an introduction to
the effect of Brexit on the applicability of EU Law, see chapter 3.
On 8 June 2009, the UK ratified the UN Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities together with the optional protocol. This
was also approved by the EU in 2009 and where possible, the law
must be interpreted consistently with the Convention.3 To date it is
not clear that this will create any additional rights in terms of the
employment sphere except in relation to the definition of ‘disability’
(see para 15.34). It is also useful in relation to the duty of courts and
tribunals to make reasonable adjustments (see para 21.73).
In the 2020/21 financial year, 7,430 disability discrimination
claims were started.4 Although disabled people are now more likely
to be employed than they were in 2002, they are still significantly
less likely to be in employment than non-disabled people. Mid 2018,
for example, 51.3 per cent of working-age disabled people were in
employment compared to 81.4 per cent of working-age non-disabled
people.5 There have been a large number of research reports and
good practice guides in the last few years, particularly regarding
mental health in the workplace. Particularly important is ACAS
guidance on Supporting mental health at work and Thriving at
work: The Stevenson/Farmer review of mental health and
employers.6

The protected characteristic of disability
Overview
15.7

‘Disability’ is a protected characteristic under Equality Act (EqA)
2010 s6. Except in obvious cases, one of the most important and
difficult issues is whether a worker falls within the definition of
‘disability’ in the EqA 2010. Far more people are covered than may
be realised. The EqA 2010 definition is very wide, and it is also

15.8

important to remember that many disabilities are invisible. In
addition, the definition includes many workers with long-term illhealth, which would not conventionally be seen as a ‘disability’. It is
dangerous to generalise about when the definition applies and each
case will depend on a close examination of its facts. A worker with
a back impairment or depression, for example, may or may not be
covered by the EqA 2010, depending on the duration and severity of
the problem. It is necessary to go through the stages of the statutory
definition. Whether the worker is recognised as disabled in other
contexts, eg for the purposes of social security benefits, requires a
different legal test.7
A ‘disabled person’ under the EqA 2010 is a person who has a
‘disability’. Section 6(1) reads:
A person (P) has a disability if–
(a) P has a physical or mental impairment, and
(b) the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on P’s ability to carry
out normal day-to-day activities.

15.9

15.10

Each element of this definition should be separately considered.8
It is essential to have a copy of the 2011 Office for Disability
Issues guidance, Equality Act 2010: Guidance on matters to be
taken into account in determining questions relating to the
definition of disability, which provides guidelines for applying the
definition.9 The Guidance has similar status to statutory codes. When
deciding whether a worker is disabled, a tribunal must take it into
account if it is relevant.10 The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)
has encouraged employment tribunals (ETs) to refer explicitly to any
relevant provision of the EHRC Employment Code or the
Guidance.11 This chapter should be read together with chapter 16 on
evidence to prove disability discrimination.
Although far more conditions are covered by the EqA 2010 than
advisers or workers may at first realise, there is no doubt that many
workers with obvious disabilities have struggled to prove they are
within the Act. Employers frequently refuse to admit that a worker
has a relevant disability once a case starts. The effect of this and the

15.11

detailed stages of the definition, has led to some seemingly obvious
cases being excluded. The EAT stressed in Goodwin12 that although
the Guidance should be looked at in deciding whether someone has a
disability, it should not be used as an obstacle if it is obvious that
they do. The Guidance is for cases where it is not obvious that a
worker has a disability, not in the majority of cases where it is clear
that s/he does.13
Workers with multiple sclerosis, HIV or cancer,14 or those
registered with a local authority or certified by a consultant
ophthalmologist as blind, severely sight impaired, sight impaired or
partially sighted,15 are deemed disabled without the need to prove
the stages of the definition. The type of cancer or stage at which it
has reached is irrelevant. Pre-cancerous skin cancer will still be
covered if cancerous cells are present, however superficially.16
Physical impairment

15.12

15.13

‘Physical impairment’ includes sensory impairment and severe
disfigurement, although not tattoos or ornamental body piercing.
Provided all aspects of the definition are met, conditions such as ME
(chronic fatigue syndrome),17 epilepsy and back disorders can be
covered. Seasonal allergic rhinitis, for example hay fever, is
expressly excluded, unless it aggravates another condition,18 eg
asthma. Addictions to alcohol, nicotine or other substances are also
not covered unless the addiction was originally the result of
administration of medical treatment or medically prescribed drugs.19
It is not necessary to consider how a physical or mental impairment
was caused. So for example, depression20 or liver disease resulting
from alcohol dependency, would count as an impairment.21
The concept of ‘impairment’ is not defined by EqA 2010. It does
not equate with a clinical condition – it is a functional concept rather
than a medical one, ie focussing more on adverse effects.22 Indeed,
sometimes it can be hard to distinguish an impairment from its
effects. An impairment can be something which results from an
illness or which is the illness itself, ie it can be cause or effect.23 A
worker can therefore have a physical impairment where s/he

genuinely suffers physical symptoms, even if these result from
psychological distress rather than any organic physical cause.24 In
such a case, the psychological condition may also amount to a mental
impairment. The underlying cause of an impairment may be hard to
establish; effects can be physical and mental, and physical effects
can be caused by a mental impairment as well as vice versa.25 It also
seems that a person can be regarded as having had a disability if s/he
has suffered from a combination of impairments with different
effects, to different extents, over periods of time which have
overlapped, even though none of the individual impairments had
sufficient adverse effect on their own.26
Mental impairment
15.14

15.15

‘Mental impairment’ can include impairments such as learning
disabilities, dyslexia and autism, as well as mental illnesses. In each
case, to amount to a ‘disability’, every stage of the definition must be
met. The original requirement in the DDA 1995 that a mental illness
be clinically well-recognised was removed in December 2005. It is
no longer necessary to name a precise condition which is recognised
by a respected body of medical opinion, eg by being listed in the
World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) international classification of
diseases. However, it is still necessary to provide evidence of a
particular impairment and its effects (though note comments in the
previous paragraph).
Workers suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe
psychoses will usually be covered. With regard to depression,
workers may also be able to claim that ordinary clinical depression
is covered, but it will depend on the circumstances and it should be
distinguished from a worker simply feeling fed-up or stressed by
adverse circumstances or life events.27 With depression, it is often
easiest to start by looking at the severity of the effects and then
consider afterwards whether there is an impairment. If the adverse
effects of the stress or depression have lasted 12 months or more, it
is likely there is a mental impairment. However, the worker’s ability
to carry out day-to-day activities must be affected. It is not enough on

its own that s/he feels unhappy about a work situation, even over a
prolonged period.28 It is also important that the depression meets
other aspects of the definition of disability, eg it must have a
substantial adverse effect for as long as 12 months (although it would
still have a long-term effect if it was likely to recur). Similarly, a
reaction to bereavement may be an ordinary response to adverse life
events or may have developed into an impairment.29
Personality disorder is another area which may or may not amount
to an impairment, and where it may be helpful (although not
essential) first to consider the effect on day-to-day activities.30
Certain personality disorders are specifically excluded, for example,
a tendency to set fires or steal, to physical or sexual abuse,
voyeurism or exhibitionism.31 Where a worker displays an excluded
disorder as a result of a non-excluded impairment, the question is
why s/he has been discriminated against. For example, a worker who
is dismissed for committing indecent exposure as a result of
depression is protected only if the dismissal is wholly or partly for
the depression as opposed to wholly for the exhibitionism.32

15.16

Affecting normal day-to-day activities
The impairment must affect the worker’s ability to carry out normal
day-to-day activities. Under the DDA 1995, it was necessary to
show that the affected abilities fell into one of several categories, ie:

15.17

•

mobility (including ability to stand);

•

manual dexterity;

•

physical co-ordination;33

•

continence;

•

ability to lift, carry or move every-day objects;34

•

speech, hearing or eyesight;

•

memory or ability to concentrate, learn or understand;35 or

•

perception of the risk of physical danger.

Ability to understand included understanding of normal social
interaction and the subtleties of human non-factual communication.36
The need to fit within these categories was removed by the EqA

15.18

15.19

15.20

2010 because not all affected activities comfortably fitted within
them. However, the list may still be a useful starting point for
checking some of the effects of an impairment.
Section D of the Guidance, together with its appendix, provides
useful guidelines and illustrations as to what are ‘normal day-to-day
activities’. A general overview is given at para D3. The activity
must be one which is carried out by many people on a daily or
frequent or fairly regular basis, although not necessarily by a
majority of people.37 Travel by tube or aeroplane is a normal
activity,38 as is taking exams.39 An activity is still normal if it is only
normal for one sex.40
Highly specialised work or leisure activities or those which
require a high level of attainment are not considered ‘normal day-today’ activities.41 The Guidance gives as examples inability to play a
musical instrument to a high level of achievement or to play a
particular sport to a high level of ability, such as would be required
for a professional footballer. This suggests that playing a piano or
guitar, or engaging in tennis, swimming or park football at a basic
hobby level, should be considered a normal day-to-day activity.
Indeed, it is hard to see how such activities are not normal for many
people. Presumably normal day-to-day activities would also be
affected if, because of an impairment such as depression, a worker
lost enthusiasm for doing any kind of hobby at all. However, to be
safe, workers should give as many examples as possible of the
effects of their impairment and not restrict these to hobbies. In many
cases, the impairment which restricts the worker’s ability to engage
in such hobbies, also affects other normal day-to-day activities
involving manual dexterity, mobility and so on.
Difficulty carrying out specialised work activities raises similar
issues. For example, in one old case, a garden centre worker was
unsuccessful because although he could not lift heavy bags of soil as
required by his job, he could still lift everyday objects.42 On the
other hand, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has
said it is a disability under the directive where a worker’s
impairment hinders his/her full and effective participation in

professional life.43 It remains to be clarified whether this includes an
inability to do the worker’s chosen profession, however specialised.
Certainly, an inability to do a work activity which is common to
many jobs, would be covered, eg using a word processor, answering
the telephone, interacting with customers,44 standing for long periods
of time,45 lifting and moving cases weighing up to 25kg46 or taking
assessments or exams.47 It is also possible that an impairment which
causes difficulty carrying out specialist tasks, might also hinder the
worker in doing normal daily activities. The Guidance gives an
example of a watch repairer who cannot carry out his job because of
tenosynovitis. Although watch repair may not be an example of a
normal day-to-day activity, the restricted movement in his hands
means he also cannot prepare invoices and count and record daily
takings. The latter are normal day-to-day activities. Adverse effects
on normal activities such as mobility, which occur only when
working at nights, would also be covered because many people do
work nights.48 All this still leaves open the question as to whether
workers are disabled if they have a disability which prevents them
doing a very specific chosen profession, but which does not interfere
with any normal work or day-to-day activity.49
Substantial effect
15.21

The Guidance at section B expands on the meaning of ‘substantial’
adverse effect. It is unnecessary that a worker is completely unable
to carry out the activity, but the effect must be more than minor or
trivial.50 A substantial effect could include where a worker can carry
out the activity, but only for short periods of time or more slowly
than usual51 or only in a particular way52 or under certain
environmental conditions.53 It may be that a worker can carry out the
activity, but it is tiring or painful to do so.54 Alternatively, the worker
may have been medically advised to refrain from the activity
altogether.55 An ET should also recognise that someone is disabled
even if s/he can get around a problem, eg by using a shoulder bag
when s/he is unable to carry a bag in his/her hand.56 An ET should

15.22

15.23

15.24

not place too much emphasis on the way a worker appears to cope at
the hearing because this can be misleading.57
A worker may tell an adviser or the tribunal that his/her day-today life is unaffected by his/her disability. This can be misleading. A
worker may play down the effect of his/her disability.58 Or it may be
that a worker has rearranged his/her life to avoid carrying out a
certain activity and feels that s/he is coping. Some coping and
avoidance strategies work to a certain extent, but break down in
certain circumstances, eg when the worker is under stress.59 Equally,
a worker would still be disabled if s/he had to take abnormal steps
to avoid things which might trigger adverse effects. The Guidance at
para B7 suggests that where reasonable avoidance steps could stop
the effects of an impairment being substantial, there may come a
point where a person is not disabled.60 This is a dangerous idea,
which could undermine the protection of disability discrimination
law. The examples given by the Guidance do suggest a high
threshold, eg a person with chronic back pain could reasonably be
expected to avoid going skiing, but not to modify more normal
activities which might exacerbate symptoms, such as shopping. It is
also important to bear in mind that if the worker’s coping/avoidance
measures amount to medical treatment, the impairment should be
assessed as it would be if such measures were not taken. This is
discussed further at para 15.28.
To assess whether an effect is substantial, comparison is made, not
with the population at large, but with how the worker would carry
out the activity if s/he did not have the impairment.61 The focus
should be on what the worker cannot do, or cannot do without
difficulty; as opposed to what s/he can do.62
The appendix to the Guidance lists examples of circumstances
where it would and would not be reasonable to regard the adverse
effect on a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day activities as
substantial. These are only indicators, not rigid tests.63 In each case,
the example is given on the basis that it is the only effect of the
impairment. It is also possible that a person is affected in a minor
way in a number of different activities and the cumulative effect is

substantial.64 It is important to remember that the list is only
illustrative, it is not exhaustive. Advisers should elicit as many
examples as possible from the worker, both from within the list and
additional to it. Remember also that a physical impairment may have
mental effects, and a mental impairment may have physical
manifestations.65 It is important always to remember the statutory
wording and that the effect need only be something more than minor
or trivial. The appendix to the Guidance can be misleading and place
the threshold too high because, as we shall see in the next two
paragraphs, on the one hand it gives examples where the effect is
substantial and on the other hand, it gives examples where the effect
is not substantial. This gives the impression that there is a sliding
scale between substantial effects and trivial effects, but there is not.
The effect of the impairment is either trivial/minor, or it is not, in
which case it is substantial and covered by the definition.66
The appendix’s examples of where it would be reasonable to
regard an impairment as having a substantial adverse effect on
normal day-to-day activities include:

15.25

•

difficulty getting dressed, preparing a meal or eating;

•

difficulty using transport, whether because of physical restrictions or as a result of a mental
impairment;

•

difficulty using steps, or ability to walk only a short distance without difficulty, eg because
of pain or fatigue;

•

difficulty carrying objects of moderate weight with one hand, eg a shopping bag or small
piece of luggage;

•

difficulty hearing and understanding another person speaking clearly on the telephone;

•

persistent and significant difficulty reading or understanding written material, eg because of
a mental impairment or learning difficulty or visual impairment;

•

difficulty understanding or following simple verbal instructions;

•

difficulty operating a computer, eg because of a physical impairment or a learning disability;

•

behaviour which challenges other people, making it difficult for the person to be accepted in
public places;

•

persistent general low motivation or loss of interest in everyday activities;

•

persistent difficulty taking part in normal social interaction;

•

compulsive activities or behaviour; difficulty adapting after a reasonable period to minor
changes in a routine;

•

difficulty concentrating;

•

intermittent loss of consciousness.

Examples given where it would not be reasonable to regard the
effect as substantial include:

15.26

•

inability to move heavy objects, eg a large suitcase or heavy piece of furniture;

•

experiencing some discomfort as a result of travelling, eg by car or plane, for more than
two hours;

•

experiencing some tiredness or minor discomfort as a result of walking unaided for one
mile;

•

minor problems with writing or spelling;

•

inability to reach typing speeds standardised for secretarial work;

•

inability to concentrate on a task requiring application over several hours;

•

inability to hold a conversation in a very noisy place, eg a factory floor or alongside a busy
main road;

•

inability to undertake activities requiring delicate hand movements, eg picking up a pin or
threading a small needle.

15.27
15.28

Severe disfigurement is deemed to have ‘substantial’ adverse
effect.67
The fact that medical treatment or medication controls or corrects
the impairment is irrelevant (except for someone whose sight
impairment is corrected by glasses or lenses).68 The effect without
the correcting measures should be assessed. So, for example, a
worker is still protected, even if his/her epilepsy is controlled by
medication or his/her depression is controlled by counselling
sessions with a clinical psychologist.69 Plates and pins inserted into
an ankle some time previously should also be taken into account if
they continue to give support.70 The test is whether the impairment is
‘likely’71 to have substantial adverse effect if the medication or
controlling measures were not taken. The EAT has suggested that an
ET should consider both the effect of a worker’s impairment while
on medication and the ‘deduced effects’ but for the medication.72
This is obviously difficult, and medical evidence may be needed. A

15.29

15.30

15.31

controversial case in 2015 suggested that although following a
particular diet on medical advice might amount to medical treatment,
eg for a person with diabetes, simply avoiding sugary drinks would
not be sufficient to amount to a ‘particular diet’; it would just be a
reasonable avoidance step as envisaged in para B7 of the Guidance.
It is difficult to follow the logic of this case and it certainly should
not be taken to mean that individuals with type 2 diabetes or, for that
matter, severe food allergies, can never be covered by the definition
of disability.73
A worker with a progressive condition, eg motor-neurone disease
or muscular dystrophy, is deemed disabled as soon as the condition
has any effect on the worker’s ability to carry out day-to-day
activities, even if the effect is not yet substantial. The worker must
prove that it is likely that at some stage in the future, the progressive
condition will lead to an impairment with a substantial adverse
effect.74 ‘Likely’ simply means ‘could well happen’, which is a
lower threshold than ‘more probable than not’.75 If the condition has
not yet had any effect at all, the worker is not protected.76 This
causes real problems for workers who are discriminated against by
their employers simply because they have been diagnosed with a
condition, but who are not covered by the EqA 2010 until the
condition starts to affect any of their day-to-day activities.
It does not matter whether the activity which is initially affected,
but not substantially, is different from the activity which will in
future be substantially affected, if both arise from the same
impairment.77 It also does not matter if the adverse effect is
indirectly caused by the impairment, eg the impairment is an immune
disorder, but it is the resultant infections which cause the substantial
adverse effect on the worker’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day
activities.78
Tattoos and body piercings for decorative or other non-medical
purposes are not considered to have a substantial adverse effect.79
Long-term effect

15.32

15.33

The EqA 2010 does not protect those with short-term or temporary
disability. To be considered long-term, the effect of the impairment
must already have lasted or be likely to last at least 12 months or for
the rest of the worker’s life.80 ‘Likely’ means it could well happen.81
It is the effect which must be long-term, not just the underlying
medical condition.82 If the effect has not yet lasted 12 months at the
time of the discriminatory actions, the tribunal must assess whether at
that point it was likely it would go on to do so.83 The tribunal has to
look at the facts and circumstances existing at the date of
discrimination. It is not a question of what has actually happened
since then. If a secondary condition is likely to develop out of an
original impairment, this can be taken into account when deciding
whether the effect of the original impairment is likely to be longterm.84 Where the disability is one which can be treated and cured, it
is relevant to consider when this might happen.85
If an impairment ceases to have substantial adverse effect but such
effect is likely to recur more than 12 months after the first
occurrence, the substantial adverse effect is treated as continuing.86
This covers workers with impairments with fluctuating or recurring
effects, eg rheumatoid arthritis or a recurrent depressive disorder.87
Conditions which recur only sporadically or for short periods (eg
epilepsy or migraine) can still be covered, depending on the facts.
Again, the likelihood must be assessed as it existed at the date of the
discrimination and not in the light of what has actually happened by
the time of the tribunal hearing.88 The tribunal can consider medical
evidence obtained after the event, as long as it relates to the
circumstances at the time. For the meaning of ‘recurring or
fluctuating effect’ see the Guidance, section C.

The EU definition
15.34

The EU directive does not define ‘disability’, so the only guidelines
we have derive from primarily two CJEU cases, Chacón Navas and
HK Danmark.89 In the latter case, the CJEU said that, as the EU has
approved the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with

Disabilities, the directive must be interpreted consistently with the
Convention as far as possible. Article 1 of the Convention says:
Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or
sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and
effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

The CJEU confirmed in HK Danmark that it does not matter if the
impairment is caused by an illness, whether curable or incurable.
Nor does it matter whether the worker has contributed to the onset of
his/her disability.90 Echoing the UN Convention, the CJEU said (para
53):
… the concept of ‘disability’ must be understood as referring to a limitation which results in
particular from long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments which in interaction
with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of the person concerned
in professional life on an equal basis with other workers?…

This applies not only to the impossibility of exercising a
professional activity, but also to a hindrance to the exercise of such
an activity.91 UK law cannot provide lesser rights than in the
directive, but it can of course choose to provide greater rights and a
wider coverage. As stated above, the CJEU’s wording is useful in
that it indicates that a measure of whether a worker is disabled is the
effect on participation in professional life, regardless of whether
there is an adverse impact on other normal day-to-day activities.

Past disability
15.35

A worker who has recovered from a past disability is protected if
s/he is discriminated against in connection with that disability.92

Pre-employment health and disability enquiries
15.36

The EqA 2010 introduced a ban on enquiries about health and
disability before a job has been offered. Such enquiries were thought
to be the main reason why disabled job candidates often failed to
reach the interview stage, and they were also a disincentive in them

15.37

15.38

applying for jobs. With certain exceptions, employers are not
allowed to ask job candidates questions about their health or whether
they have a disability until they have offered a job (on a conditional
or unconditional basis) or put the candidate into a pool of successful
candidates to be offered a job when one becomes available.93 This
includes questions about previous sickness absence.94 The questions
must not be asked at any stage of the application process and the
candidate must not be referred to an occupational health practitioner
or asked to fill in an occupational health questionnaire before any
offer is made.95 If a disabled worker volunteers health information
during an interview, the employer still needs to avoid discussing the
matter further (unless within one of the exceptions set out below).
The rules also apply in respect of contract workers and to job
agencies.96
Employers can make offers conditional on health or disability
checks. So once the offer has been made, an employer can make
enquiries and there is always the risk that the offer will be
subsequently withdrawn. However, any change of heart by the
employer would be more obviously disability-related at that stage
(although not necessarily so) and subject to the usual rules on
disability discrimination.
The EHRC can bring proceedings against an employer who makes
unlawful pre-employment health enquiries.97 It is especially worth
drawing it to the EHRC’s attention if a large employer persists with
making pre-employment health and disability enquiries. An
individual job candidate cannot bring a disability discrimination
claim purely because such an unlawful enquiry was made, but s/he
can bring a claim in respect of any discriminatory action taken by the
employer as a result of information contained in his/her response to
the question, eg if the employer fails to offer the candidate the job
because it was clear from the candidate’s answer that s/he was
disabled. In such a case, the fact that the employer made a preemployment health or disability enquiry reverses the burden of
proof.98 The employer would then have to explain why s/he had not
offered the job, and if the explanation was unconvincing, the tribunal

15.39

15.40

would find disability discrimination. Unfortunately, the burden of
proof only shifts where the claim brought by the job candidate is for
direct discrimination,99 which considerably reduces the effectiveness
of the protection, since job candidates are probably more likely to be
rejected from a job because of discrimination arising from disability
(DAFD) than from direct discrimination. In a DAFD case, therefore,
a candidate would still need to establish a prima facie case to make
the burden of proof shift, though there is no reason why an ET could
not take it into account if an employer who knew the rules
deliberately flouted them.
There are exceptions so that an employer can make preemployment health and disability enquiries where necessary to
monitor the diversity of job applicants100 or to find out whether the
candidate will be able to undergo an interview or other job
assessment or will need reasonable adjustments to that process.101
However, questions about reasonable adjustments needed for the job
itself should not be asked until after a job offer is made (unless
relating to a function which is intrinsic to the job, as explained
below). The employer can also ask necessary questions for positive
action purposes under EqA 2010 s158102 or where the employer has
decided that, having regard to the nature or context of the work, it is
a justifiable occupational requirement that the successful candidate
have a particular disability.103
Potentially the most problematic exception is that the employer
can ask questions necessary to establish whether the candidate can
carry out a function which is intrinsic to the work concerned.104
Where the employer reasonably believes s/he would have a duty to
make reasonable adjustments for that candidate in relation to the
work, this means a function which is intrinsic once the employer has
complied with that duty.105 It is not clear what ‘intrinsic’ means. The
EHRC suggests in the EHRC Employment Code that this means only
functions necessary to a job. It gives as an example, an employer
recruiting a scaffolder could ask questions relating to a candidate’s
ability to climb ladders and scaffolding to a significant height.106 The
Code says this exception should be applied narrowly.107

15.41

The prohibition on pre-employment and disability health enquiries
does not apply where it is necessary to vet applicants for reasons of
national security.108

Disability discrimination
Forms of disability discrimination
15.42

There are six forms of unlawful discrimination in relation to
disability:
1) failure to make reasonable adjustments;109
2) direct discrimination;110
3) DAFD;111
4) harassment;112
5) indirect discrimination;113
6) victimisation.114

The definitions of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination,
victimisation and harassment are common to all the protected
characteristics under the EqA 2010.
Failure to make reasonable adjustments
15.43

The duty on employers to make reasonable adjustments is at the heart
of disability discrimination law. A failure to make reasonable
adjustments constitutes unlawful discrimination.115 The duty divides
into three similar categories which are framed as ‘requirements’:
1) Where the employer applies a provision, criterion or practice (PCP) which puts a
disabled person at a substantial disadvantage compared with people who are not disabled.
The employer must then take such steps as are reasonable to avoid the disadvantage.116
2) Where a physical feature puts a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage compared
with people who are not disabled. Again, the employer must take such steps as are
reasonable to avoid the disadvantage, eg by removing or altering the feature.117
3) Where a disabled person would, but for the provision of an auxiliary aid, be put at a
substantial disadvantage compared with people who are not disabled. The employer must
then take such steps as are reasonable to provide the auxiliary aid.118

15.44

15.45

15.46

A disabled worker is not entitled to a reasonable adjustment simply
because s/he is disabled. S/he must be put at a substantial
disadvantage by a PCP or physical feature of the premises or lack of
an auxiliary aid, compared with a non-disabled worker. The reason
for the comparison is to establish whether it is because of the
worker’s disability that s/he is put at the disadvantage.119 The
purpose of the adjustment is then to address that disadvantage. A
‘substantial’ disadvantage means one that is more than minor or
trivial.120 It is not necessary to show that the PCP would also put
other workers with the same disability at a disadvantage.121
Moreover, if a PCP is more likely to bite on disabled workers, it is
irrelevant that non-disabled workers would also be disadvantaged
by the PCP if they could not comply with it.122
The phrase ‘provision, criterion or practice’ may be familiar from
the definition of indirect discrimination, and it means the same thing
in both contexts.123 It can cover formal and informal policies, rules,
requirements and arrangements, eg attendance and training policies;
selection criteria for recruitment, promotion and redundancy; job
duties and deadlines. A dismissal is not a PCP in itself, but it might
be the result of a different PCP, eg a requirement to be fit for
work.124 A PCP can include imposing an expectation or a strong
request.125
Although ‘provision criterion or practice’ should be interpreted
widely, it does not apply to every decision or to every act of unfair
treatment by an employer. The PCP must be capable of being applied
to other people, even if that has not actually happened. Also, the
word ‘practice’ suggests repetition, eg the employer has acted that
way more than once, or the evidence suggests the employer would
act that way again in future if a similar situation arose. It is not
impossible for a one-off decision or action to be a practice, but it
depends on the facts.126 For example, if an employer repeatedly fails
to investigate a worker’s grievances, this is likely to be a ‘practice’.
But if, on a one-off occasion, in a very particular context, an
employer has not investigated a worker’s grievance, this might be
unique to the circumstances and not a ‘practice’, because there is no

15.47

15.48

15.49

15.50

indication it would happen again, either with that worker or with any
other.
Workers sometimes try to fit the employer’s treatment awkwardly
into the phrase PCP, when the other two reasonable adjustment
categories would fit the situation much more easily.127 A ‘physical
feature of the premises’ can be temporary or permanent and includes
internal and external features such as steps, exits, parking areas,
doors, toilets, lighting and ventilation, floor coverings, furniture and
signs.128 An ‘auxiliary aid’ is something which provides support or
assistance to a disabled person, eg a specialist piece of equipment,
or an auxiliary service129 such as a support worker or sign language
interpreter.130
In the employment field, there is no open-ended duty to make
adjustments. The duty is owed only to a particular disabled worker
or job applicant if s/he is put at a disadvantage by workplace
practices or features. A worker who fails to get a job or who is not
promoted or trained or who suffers any other detriment as a result of
an employer’s failure to make reasonable adjustments may bring a
discrimination case. There is no duty under the EqA 2010 or under
European law131 to make reasonable adjustments to enable a nondisabled worker to look after a disabled relative.132
The EHRC Employment Code says that any reasonable
adjustments should be implemented in timely fashion.133 This is a
very important point. It is a common feature of disability
discrimination cases that the necessary adjustments have taken an
extremely long time to put into place, often leading to a breakdown
of the working relationship. Failure to make reasonable adjustments
can, if sufficiently serious, amount to a fundamental breach of the
implied term of trust and confidence, entitling an employee to resign
and claim constructive dismissal.134
Failure to make a reasonable adjustment can never be justified.135
It is for the tribunal to decide, using an objective test, whether it
thinks that an adjustment would have been reasonable. It is not
simply a matter of what the employer reasonably thinks.136

The employer’s knowledge
15.51

15.52

15.53

The employer is under no duty to make reasonable adjustments if
s/he does not know and cannot reasonably be expected to know that
the worker has a disability and does not know and cannot reasonably
be expected to know that the worker is likely to be placed at a
substantial disadvantage as a result.137 A worker may not have to tell
an employer that s/he is disabled, but if s/he needs adjustments to be
made, s/he would be wise to tell the employer clearly in writing that
s/he is disabled and any adjustment s/he thinks may help. Although an
employer has a duty to make reasonable enquiries based on
information given to him/her, there is no absolute onus on the
employer to make every enquiry possible.138 When disability
discrimination law first came into force, early cases suggested,
rather alarmingly, that employers did not always need to take a very
proactive approach in finding out whether a worker was disabled.
However, ETs are likely now to have higher expectations of
employers. The Code says employers must do all they can
reasonably be expected to do to find out if someone has a disability
and is likely to need reasonable adjustments.139
An employer cannot just rely on a statement by an occupational
health doctor that a worker is not disabled. Responsible employers
have to make their own judgment. This involves asking occupational
health specific medical questions which are relevant to the definition
and not just making a general enquiry. For example, does the worker
have an impairment; which day-to-day activities are adversely
affected; is the effect likely to be long-term? Having said that, an
employer can still give great weight to an informed and reasoned
occupational health report.140
With regard to job applicants, an employer is not subject to the
duty to make reasonable adjustments if s/he does not know and could
not reasonably be expected to know that a disabled person was or
might be a job applicant.141
Types of adjustment

Chapter 6 of the EHRC Employment Code142 deals with the duty to
make reasonable adjustments. It says a good starting point is for the
employer to conduct a proper assessment in consultation with the
disabled worker of what adjustments may be required.143 Failure to
carry out such an assessment or even to think about the possibility of
adjustments is almost certainly not a breach of the duty to make
reasonable adjustments in itself.144 It is always necessary for a
tribunal to decide that there is a particular practical adjustment
which should have been carried out. However, if employers fail to
consult, they seriously risk failing to take appropriate steps through
ignorance.
The EHRC Employment Code makes suggestions (with examples)
as to the type of steps which employers may have to take, eg:

15.54

15.55

•

adjusting premises;

•

providing information in accessible formats;

•

acquiring or modifying equipment;

•

providing a reader or interpreter;

•

modifying procedures for testing and assessment;

•

adjusting hours of work or training;

•

allowing time off for rehabilitation, assessment or treatment;

•

allowing a period of disability leave;

•

providing training or mentoring for the disabled worker or someone else;

•

providing supervision or other support; reallocating some duties;

•

assigning the disabled worker to a different workplace or allowing home working;

•

transferring him/her to fill an existing vacancy;

•

permitting flexible working;

•

modifying disciplinary or grievance procedures;

•

adjusting redundancy selection criteria

and modifying performance-related pay

arrangements; or
•

employing a support worker and participating in supported employment schemes.145

Many of these suggestions were previously set out in the DDA 1995,
but the EqA 2010 does not give any examples of adjustments.
Presumably the reason was to keep an already very long Act concise.
In any event, it should not make any difference legally whether the

15.56

examples are in the statutory Code or in the Act. Adjustments are not
confined to those needed to enable a worker to function in his/her
job; they include countering a disadvantage in terms and
conditions.146
The duty to make reasonable adjustments is unique to the protected
characteristic of disability and it is central to the effectiveness of
disability discrimination law. In the key case of Archibald v Fife
Council,147 the House of Lords said that disability discrimination
law was different from sex and race discrimination law in that
employers are required to take steps to help disabled people, which
they are not required to take for others:
The duty to make adjustments may require the employer to treat a disabled person more
favourably to remove the disadvantage which is attributable to the disability. This
necessarily entails a measure of positive discrimination.

The House of Lords Select Committee on the Equality Act 2010 and
Disability reported in 2016 that a significant problem is employers’
failure to understand that making adjustments may involve giving a
disabled person more favourable treatment. Employers often tell
disabled employers that they ‘cannot show any favouritism’ to them.
The Committee said this is an unsuitable one-size fits all approach.
In addition, understanding is also low on hidden disabilities. The
Committee said many employees are told by their employer that they
cannot have any adjustments because they do not have a physical
disability.148
When is an adjustment reasonable?
15.57

15.58

In considering whether an employer has met any duty of reasonable
adjustment, the ET must apply an objective test. Although it should
look closely at the employer’s explanation, it must reach its own
decision on what steps were reasonable and what was objectively
justified. Sometimes it may be necessary for an employer to make
more than one adjustment.149
Factors which are particularly relevant in deciding whether it was
reasonable for the employer to have made the necessary adjustment

15.59

15.60

15.61

are the extent to which the adjustment would prevent the
disadvantage, the practicability of the employer making the
adjustment, the employer’s financial and other resources, the
availability of financial or other assistance to make the adjustment,
and the cost and disruption entailed. These factors are set out in the
EHRC Employment Code.150
Sometimes friends and family might be prepared to help a
disabled person, eg they may be willing to help a dyslexic person
who has difficulty completing an online application form. But if it is
otherwise reasonable for an employer to make an adjustment, other
people should not be expected to do so, just in order to save the
employer the trouble.151
Employers cannot require disabled workers to pay any of their
costs in complying with the duty.152 Research suggests that
adjustments are not necessarily expensive. There may also be
financial assistance available, eg grants under the Access to Work
Scheme153 as well as advice and information from specialist bodies,
eg the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and the Work
Coaches at the local Jobcentre Plus offices. When considering the
reasonableness of an adjustment, the cost of not making the
adjustment may also be a relevant factor, eg it may be more
expensive to medically retire a worker than make the needed
adjustments to keep him/her in work.
It is not necessary that a particular step is guaranteed to work – it
is enough if there is a prospect of it working; it does not even need to
be a ‘real prospect’ or a ‘good prospect’.154 However, the likelihood
of the proposed adjustment preventing the disadvantage to the worker
is still a factor affecting whether it is reasonable.155 It may also
affect compensation.156
Examples of adjustments

15.62

When running a case, a worker needs to make some suggestions as to
what adjustments should have been made.157 The following are some
examples of possible adjustments given in the EHRC Employment
Code.158 Note that whether it is reasonable to expect the employer to

make such adjustments will depend on all the facts of the case.
Possibilities are:
•

allowing the worker to work flexi-time to enable additional breaks to overcome fatigue or
changing the worker’s hours to avoid travel on public transport during rush hours;

•

where no reasonable adjustment can keep the worker in his/her original post, transferring
him/her to an available suitable alternative post with retraining and modified equipment;

•

ensuring a worker with autism has a structured working day and making sure other
workers co-operate with this arrangement;159

15.63

•

discounting periods of disability-related absence when selecting for redundancy;

•

allowing a phased return to work with a gradual build-up of hours.

Depending on the facts, the duty may require moving the worker
without competitive interview to a post at a slightly higher grade.160
If an employee needs redeployment as a result of his/her disability,
s/he must be given equal priority (at least) with other categories of
redeployee, eg redundant employees.161 It would also be a
reasonable adjustment before dismissing a worker to consult him/her
regarding his/her continued prospects for employment.162 It does not
necessarily excuse an employer from making a reasonable adjustment
that disciplinary action which may lead to dismissal is pending.163 It
depends on the difficulty of effecting the adjustment, the likelihood of
dismissal and the fairness of the disciplinary process. An employer
may be under a duty to make physical arrangements for the worker to
go to the toilet or to accommodate an external carer to help the
worker do so. However, this does not go as far as a duty actually to
provide carers to attend to a worker’s personal needs.164 Reasonable
adjustments have to enable a worker to work, and not just be steps on
the way. So just as it is not a reasonable adjustment to carry out a
risk assessment (see para 15.54), it is not a reasonable adjustment to
pay the worker to do non-productive work merely by way of
rehabilitation.165 This is to be distinguished from allowing a phased
return to work with reduced and less pressurised tasks which
nevertheless do amount to work done for the employer. This latter
scenario is a commonly required adjustment.

15.64

15.65

15.66

15.67

Although it is a common reasonable adjustment to relocate a
worker into a suitable existing vacancy, an employer would rarely be
required to create an entirely new job. However, there could be
some circumstances where it was appropriate, eg if the employer
was in the middle of a reorganisation where many new jobs were
being designed. It would also be extremely unusual to expect an
employer to require a non-disabled worker to swap jobs with a
disabled worker, but it might be feasible in a workplace where an
employer frequently instructs workers to change jobs and where the
non-disabled worker has no real objection to the move.166 In certain
circumstances, it may be a reasonable adjustment to maintain a
worker’s pay at the original level, even though moving him/her to a
lower grade job.167 After all, other types of adjustment may involve
a cost to the employer. Nevertheless, this will not be an adjustment
which is routinely ordered by a tribunal and may depend on the
amount of differential and period of protected pay.
It will rarely be a reasonable adjustment to pay full sick pay
which has otherwise run out in respect of disability-related
absences, especially if the original sick pay was generous.168
However, it may be a reasonable adjustment to pay a worker fully if
s/he is off sick due to the employer’s failure to make a reasonable
adjustment which would enable him/her to return to work.169
There is no absolute rule that disability-related absences must be
disregarded for the purpose of totting-up and triggering a review
process or dismissal under a sickness absence procedure. To what
extent disregarding disability-related absences for this and other
purposes may be a reasonable adjustment depends on the facts of the
particular case. However, it is likely an ET would expect employers
at least to consider disability-related absences separately from other
sick leave and to think about each case separately, rather than have a
general all-purpose total target.
Where a worker is unhappy about being subjected to a sickness
absence procedure or its consequences, it is important to think
carefully about how to formulate the PCP. ‘Application of the
Attendance Policy’ is vague and likely to lead to difficulties.170

15.68

15.69

Where a worker is disciplined or dismissed for poor attendance
under a sickness absence procedure, the relevant PCP is usually that
s/he had to maintain a certain level of attendance at work in order not
to be subject to the risk of disciplinary sanctions. Although both
disabled and non-disabled workers would suffer stress and anxiety if
they were ill in circumstances which might lead to disciplinary
sanctions, a disabled worker is at a substantial disadvantage if s/he
is more likely because of his/her disability to be unable to meet the
attendance requirement.171 The worker could alternatively or
additionally bring a claim for DAFD if s/he was disciplined,
dismissed, made redundant, not promoted etc because of his/her
disability-related sickness record (see below). The issue would then
be whether the employer could justify his/her actions. See para 7.24
above for dismissals where contractual sick pay is still due or where
there are benefits under health insurance schemes or there is a
possibility of ill-health retirement.
Provision of awareness training for other employees in relation to
the worker’s disability could also be a reasonable adjustment.172
Indeed, in some cases a reasonable adjustment will not succeed
without the co-operation of other workers. Subject to confidentiality,
the employer must make sure this happens. The EHRC Employment
Code says it is unlikely to be a defence to a claim for reasonable
adjustments that other staff were obstructive or unhelpful, and the
employer must at least try to deal with such behaviour.173
Special rules exist where an employer may need to alter premises
which s/he occupies under a lease.174
Contract workers

15.70

The duty to make reasonable adjustments applies both to the
employer and to the principal of any contract worker.175 The period
of time that the worker is likely to be placed with the principal will
be relevant to what adjustments it would be reasonable for the
principal to have to make.176
Direct disability discrimination

15.71

15.72

15.73

15.74

15.75

The definition of direct discrimination and general principles are
explained in chapter 13. It is important to read those paragraphs
before reading this chapter. In the context of disability, direct
discrimination occurs where an employer treats a disabled worker
less favourably because of his/her disability than s/he treats or
would treat a worker who was not disabled or who did not have that
particular disability. For example, a disabled worker is sacked
because his/her total sickness absence amounts to three months,
whereas a non-disabled worker who is off sick for three months is
not sacked. This suggests the employer has treated the disabled
worker less favourably because s/he is disabled, unless the employer
can prove a credible reason for the different treatment which is
unrelated to disability. It is still possible, though harder, to prove
direct discrimination where there is no comparator, eg no one else
has been off sick for three months.177
Stereotypical assumptions made about a worker because of his/her
disability may also be direct discrimination, eg failing to recruit a
disabled worker because of an assumption that s/he will take
excessive time off sick,178 or an overreaction to a worker’s
behaviour because of stereotyped views of mental illness.179 In
Coffey, the employer made a stereotypical assumption that a police
officer with hearing loss was not capable of front-line duties.180
It can also be direct disability discrimination to treat a person less
favourably because of their particular disability as opposed to
someone with a different disability.181
As with all direct discrimination claims, there must be no material
difference between the circumstances relating to the worker and
his/her actual or hypothetical comparator.182 In the case of direct
disability discrimination, these circumstances include the abilities of
the worker and the comparator.183 For example, a disabled worker
with arthritis is not selected for a job because s/he types too slowly.
The comparator is a non-disabled worker who types at the same
pace as the disabled worker.
Sometimes it is difficult to identify the relevant circumstances of
the appropriate comparator. For example, in Aylott, a worker with

15.76

15.77

bipolar affective disorder was dismissed because of his attendance
record. The correct comparator would be a person who did not have
the conduct and performance difficulties which were in fact caused
by the worker’s disability.184 The Court of Appeal in Aylott and in
Coffey suggested it is easier to start by asking why the claimant has
been treated as s/he has. If it is because of his/ her disability, eg
because of stereotyping, it usually follows that a hypothetical
comparator without that disability would have been treated better.
The importance of direct discrimination, as opposed to
discrimination arising from disability, is that there is no justification
defence available to the employer. Sometimes it can be hard to
identify which type of discrimination took place. For example, has
the employer refused to recruit a worker because the worker is in
fact unable to do certain duties due to his/her disability
(discrimination arising from disability) or because the employer
wrongly assumes that a worker with such a disability would be
unable to do the duties (direct discrimination/ stereotyping)?
Note that it is not discrimination against a non-disabled person to
treat a disabled person more favourably because of his/her
disability.185
Associative disability discrimination

15.78

15.79

As with other protected characteristics,186 it is unlawful to directly
discriminate against a worker because s/he is associated with
someone else who has a disability. For example, a worker is not
invited to a business dinner with clients, where everyone is attending
with their partners, because her partner is disabled. The word
‘associative’ does not appear in the EqA 2010, so it is important not
to become preoccupied with what it means. The Act simply says that
the employer must not treat a worker less favourably because of ‘a’
protected characteristic. That would include the protected
characteristic (disability) of other people.
Unfortunately, the scope of this protection has been widely
misunderstood. It is far more limited than it appears, and it does not
give a general right to time off to care for disabled relatives. If the

complaint is that the employer has refused, or otherwise penalised
the worker for taking time off to care for a disabled relative, the
actual or hypothetical comparator is a worker who took or wanted to
take time off to care for a non-disabled relative. This is well
illustrated in the Coleman case,187 which established the right to
claim associative disability discrimination under the DDA 1995 and
the General Framework Directive. Ms Coleman complained that that
her employers did not allow her the same flexibility regarding her
working hours to look after her disabled son, as they did her
colleagues, who were parents of non-disabled children. She said she
was described as lazy when she requested time off to look after her
son, whereas parents of non-disabled children were allowed time
off. If proved by the evidence, this would be direct associative
discrimination. On the other hand, if an employer refused everyone
time off for childcare, whether or not their child was disabled, this
would not succeed as a disability discrimination claim.188
Discrimination because of perceived disability
15.80

15.81

It is unlawful to directly discriminate against a worker because of
his/her perceived disability.189 This is fairly straightforward with
most of the other protected characteristics, but is difficult to apply in
disability cases. What exactly is it that the employer must have
wrongly perceived? It is fairly clear-cut if an employer makes an
entirely false assumption that a worker has a disability when the
worker actually has no impairment whatsoever. For example, an
employer has misunderstood something which was said, or has
jumped to conclusions through overheard conversations or
stereotyped ideas, eg that a worker has HIV or mental health
difficulties. This would seem to be covered.
However, how does it work in other situations? The EAT has said
it is not to do with whether the employer understands the law or not.
It is to do with whether the employer (wrongly) perceives the worker
to have an impairment with the necessary elements of the legal
definition. For example, an employer does not recruit a worker
because s/he wrongly perceives that the worker’s hearing loss is

severe enough to have an adverse effect on her ability to carry out
day-to-day activities or that it is likely in the future to become so
severe.190
Discrimination arising from disability
15.82

15.83

The definition of DAFD was new to the EqA 2010, replacing the
previous concept of disability-related discrimination in the DDA
1995 whose effectiveness was eroded by the case of Mayor and
Burgess of Lewisham LBC v Malcolm.191 The definition of DAFD
was designed to cover the same ground as disability-related
discrimination, but to avoid the technical problems exposed by the
Malcolm case.
Under EqA 2010 s15(1):
A person (A) discriminates against a disabled person (B) if–
(a) A treats B unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of B’s
disability; and
(b) A cannot show that the treatment is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate
aim.

Unlike with the definition of direct discrimination, it is not necessary
to compare the worker’s treatment with that of a comparator. It is
only necessary to show the worker was treated ‘unfavourably’, ie
that s/he was put at a disadvantage.192 The ‘consequence’ of a
disability includes anything which is the result, effect or outcome of
the disability, eg inability to use certain equipment at work.193
Another example might be if a partially-sighted worker was
dismissed for making computer-entry errors, when those mistakes
were because s/he could not see the computer screen properly. There
is a tendency to misunderstand DAFD. The question is not simply
whether the treatment of the worker caused him/her difficulty
because of his/her disability. The starting point is why the employer
treated the worker as s/he did, eg the employer dismissed the worker
because the worker was unable to type sufficiently fast. The next
question is whether that reason was something arising in
consequence of the worker’s disability, eg the reason the worker

typed slowly was as a result of his/her arthritis.194 The employer
need not be aware that the ‘something’ arises in consequence of the
worker’s disability.195 Note that if there are several reasons for
treating a worker unfavourably, it is sufficient if only one of them
was something arising from his/her disability, provided that reason
was a ‘significant (ie more than trivial) influence’. It need not be the
only or main reason.196
It is useful to consider again the example where an employer
dismisses a disabled worker because s/he has been off sick for three
months. If the employer would have dismissed the worker for three
months’ absence, whether or not s/he was disabled, the employer has
not directly discriminated against the disabled worker. However, if
the disabled worker’s absences were as a result of his/her disability,
the dismissal would be DAFD. A DAFD claim is less attractive than
a direct discrimination claim to a worker, because the employer has
the possibility of proving the dismissal is justified as a proportionate
means of achieving a legitimate aim.
Note that the ‘something’ must arise ‘in consequence of’ the
disability. This is a looser connection than ‘because of’ the
disability.197 The ‘something’ may arise from the worker’s disability
in different ways. These examples have been found to be DAFD:

15.84

15.85

•

Giving a worker a negative reference because of her absence record, where the absences
were due to her disability.198

•

Dismissing a worker because she could not decide whether to accept a new shift until a
medical report into her disability was received.199

•

Treating a worker unfavourably because of a genuine but wrong belief that she was falsely
claiming to be sick, when in fact her absence was due to disability-related sickness.200

•

Excluding workers from a bonus because the scheme automatically excluded workers who
had a formal warning for sickness absence. The claimants, who were disabled, had each
received a warning for absences which were disability-related.201

•

Dismissing a worker for losing his temper over a non-accessible training venue, even
though being short-tempered was not in itself caused by his disability.202

•

Taking action against a worker because of something she has done as a result of anxiety
arising from her disability. Generally, a worker’s genuine but false belief that certain
workplace conditions will aggravate her physical disability is not something arising from her

disability, However, it may become so if that belief arises from the pain or stress of the
disability.203

The justification defence
15.86

15.87

It is a defence to DAFD if the employer can prove the unfavourable
treatment was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.
This wording is the same as used for the objective justification of
indirect discrimination in relation to all the protected characteristics
(see para 13.48 onwards). In particular, it is important not to forget
the ‘proportionate means’ part of the defence so that, eg, in a
dismissal case, the tribunal should balance the prejudice to the
worker of losing his/her job against the employer’s legitimate aim.204
If the treatment is the automatic result of applying a rule or policy, it
is usually the rule or policy which must be justified. However, this
rarely applies to disability cases involving attendance management
because attendance management policies generally allow for a series
of responses to individual circumstances. The tribunal should
therefore consider each discretionary step taken by the employer and
whether it is justified.205
It is hard to see how DAFD could be justified if the employer has
not made relevant reasonable adjustments. For example, if a typist is
dismissed for typing too slowly because of arthritis, this is unlikely
to be justifiable if s/he could have reached acceptable typing speeds
had the employer obtained accessible keyboards. Similarly,
dismissing a worker because s/he cannot return to work as a result of
failure to make reasonable adjustments is almost bound to be
unjustifiable DAFD. The reverse does not necessarily hold true –
just because there are no reasonable adjustments which the employer
could have made, does not necessarily mean that the unfavourable
treatment of the worker was justifiable DAFD.206
The employer’s knowledge

15.88

DAFD is not unlawful if the employer can prove s/he did not know,
and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that the

worker had the disability.207 There is no explicit requirement that the
employer was aware of the effects of the disability.
Harassment
15.89

The general law on harassment in respect of all characteristics is set
out in chapter 13.
Indirect discrimination

15.90

15.91

15.92

The definition of indirect discrimination is explained in chapter 13.
Indirect discrimination did not apply to disability prior to the EqA
2010. It was not thought necessary because of the easier and more
targeted concept of reasonable adjustments.
When applying the definition of indirect discrimination to
disability, it must be shown that the PCP puts the worker and others
who have the same disability at a particular disadvantage.208 It is
unclear how closely defined the disability needs to be for these
purposes. One example of indirect disability discrimination would
be if an employer’s office was located on the second floor of a
building with no lift. This would disadvantage a disabled worker
who was unable to climb stairs. It would also disadvantage other
workers who were unable because of the same disability to climb
stairs. It would then be a question of whether the employer could
objectively justify the location of the workplace.
A worker unable to climb stairs could equally claim failure to
make reasonable adjustments, provided the employer knew of his/her
disability. Indeed, it is hard to think of many examples where it
would be necessary to claim indirect discrimination, as opposed to
failure to make reasonable adjustments. Loosely speaking, in both
cases, it is necessary to show the employer has applied a PCP to the
worker which has put the worker at a disadvantage. In the case of
indirect discrimination, it is also necessary to show that the PCP puts
or would put other disabled people at a particular disadvantage. This
is a difficult stage in indirect discrimination cases, but not necessary
at all in reasonable adjustment claims, where only the worker
bringing the claim needs to be affected. Then in an indirect

15.93

15.94

discrimination case, an employer has a defence if s/he can prove
applying the PCP was objectively justified as a proportionate means
of achieving a legitimate aim. This defence is not available to
employers in reasonable adjustment claims, though the employer is
only required to take such steps as are ‘reasonable’.
It is also possible for indirect discrimination to apply where a
PCP puts workers with a particular disability at a disadvantage
compared with workers who have a different disability.209
Possibly one situation where an indirect discrimination claim may
prove advantageous over a reasonable adjustment claim is where the
employer is not aware that the worker is disabled or needs a
reasonable adjustment. Although knowledge is required for the
reasonable adjustment obligation to apply, it is not explicitly
required for indirect discrimination. It may be that there are other
examples which are not immediately apparent. Cautious advisers
may want to claim indirect discrimination in the alternative if they
identify potential difficulties with a reasonable adjustment claim, but
this needs to be balanced against the added complexities of such a
claim. Another use of the concept of indirect discrimination may be
as a negotiating tool where employers are proposing to make
workplace changes which are likely to disadvantage workers with
certain disabilities.
Victimisation

15.95

The law on victimisation is set out in chapter 13. There are no
special considerations applicable to disability.

Deciding on the relevant claim
15.96

There are so many different types of disability discrimination that it
can become confusing to decide which ones apply to a particular set
of facts. The best approach is first to identify the apparently
discriminatory actions by the employer, eg failure to promote,
disciplinary action, dismissal; and then to test each definition of
discrimination against each action, looking for the most natural fit.
However, when making a final decision on how to put the claim, it is

15.97

15.98

15.99

important not to lose sight of the wood for the trees. It is easy to bury
a good claim by listing too many small incidents and covering every
option out of anxiety, when the evidence to prove some types of
discrimination is weak.
Where a worker’s complaint is about a specific action, such as
failure to promote or dismissal, the most obvious claim (subject to
evidence) is usually that such action amounted to direct
discrimination or DAFD. It is often uncertain whether the evidence
suggests direct discrimination or DAFD, in which case, an ‘and/or’
claim can be made. Remember the advantage of direct discrimination
is that there is no justification defence available to the employer. The
disadvantage is usually that it is harder to prove.
A DAFD claim can often be looked at through a different
perspective as a claim for failure to make reasonable adjustments.
For example, if a worker is demoted because s/he cannot do his/her
job, which in turn is because a reasonable adjustment has not been
made, his/her claim could also be for the failure to make the
reasonable adjustment as opposed to for the demotion. The
compensation would include financial loss arising from the
demotion. Similarly, a disability-related dismissal due to the
worker’s absence on sick leave could amount to a failure to make
reasonable adjustments if adjustments such as allowing a staged
return to work or offering alternative employment would have
avoided the dismissal.210 In cases like this, it is usually best to claim
both DAFD and/or failure to make reasonable adjustments. This is
because the reasonable adjustment claim may not quite fit the exact
circumstances.211 There is also a potential time limit risk in that the
failure to make adjustments may have occurred some time before the
later demotion or dismissal or other action.212
In other situations, the claim is very obviously for failure to make
reasonable adjustments and nothing else. Often such claims will also
amount to indirect discrimination, but this may add an unnecessary
complexity if a reasonable adjustment claim will cover the situation.

Exceptions

Occupational requirements
15.100 The

occupational requirement exception, where in certain
circumstances it is not unlawful for an employer to require a worker
to have a particular protected characteristic, is set out in chapter 13.
In disability cases, this exception is less important because an
employer is in any event permitted to treat a disabled worker more
favourably because of his/her disability than a non-disabled
worker.213 However, the exception may be useful in relation to
special treatment for those with a particular disability.
Supported employment

15.101 Some charities are permitted to provide employment only to people
with a particular disability in order to help them gain employment.214

Armed forces
15.102 The rules against disability discrimination do not apply to service in
the armed forces.215

Special cases
Long Covid
15.103 As

at 1 August 2021, an estimated 970,000 people were
experiencing self-reported long Covid. Of those 40 per cent were
experiencing the symptoms over a year after the first (suspected)
infection. Of working adults, 38 per cent said it had negatively
affected their ability to work.216In TUC research, workers reported
that they were faced with disbelief and suspicion, with employers
questioning the impact of their symptoms and sometimes challenging
whether they had long Covid at all.217 ACAS has advice for
employers and employees on its website.218 There is also useful
information from the NHS.219
15.104
Long Covid, also known as post-Covid-19 syndrome, may in some
cases meet the definition of disability. Common symptoms include
difficulty sleeping, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty

concentrating, brain fog and memory problems, palpitations and
dizziness, joint pain / muscle ache, depression and anxiety, loss of
appetite, loss of smell, earache and feeling sick. This could cause
substantial adverse effects on day-to-day activities such as difficulty
completing housework, other tasks, or a full work day due to
tiredness, difficulty walking or climbing stairs, difficulty eating a
normal meal, reluctance to socialise etc. The effects often fluctuate.
One key issue may be whether the substantial effects are long-term. If
they have not yet lasted 12 months, are they ‘likely’ to go on to do
so? This may be hard to prove with an illness which is still not fully
understood, but general statistics from the Office of National
Statistics (ONS) as to the usual duration of long Covid together with
a specific medical report may be helpful.
15.105
Reasonable adjustments may include flexible working, breaks,
recording Covid-related absence separately from other sick leave,
and delaying capability procedures. Both ACAS and the TUC
recommend as good practice that employers focus on making
adjustments rather than whether or not an individual has a disability
and can make legal claims.

The menopause
15.106 Difficulties faced by many menopausal women at work have long

been a taboo unaddressed subject. In recent years, the issue has
gained publicity and some claims for disability or sex discrimination
have been brought in tribunals. Unfortunately, the law is not designed
to address menopause discrimination, and it is a poor fit. For an
introduction to the menopause and work, see the section on the
menopause in chapter 14. That section looks at whether sex and/or
age discrimination law can apply. However, pending new targeted
legislation, disability discrimination law will often be the most
useful where a woman is badly affected.
15.107
The menopause is not a disability, but its symptoms can fit the
legal definition where they are sufficiently severe and long-lasting.
Every woman will be differently affected in terms of type and
seriousness of symptom. Common symptoms include hot flushes and

body temperature swings; night sweats; difficulty sleeping; tiredness
and lack of energy; difficulty concentrating or memory problems;
heavy and unpredictable periods; bladder infections; headaches
including migraines; dry eyes; feelings of stress; depression and
anxiety; panic attacks; crying spells; mood swings and irritability;
loss of confidence and feelings of isolation.
15.108
In terms of the definition of disability, the following are examples
of potential substantial adverse effects on ability to carry out normal
day-to-day activities:220
•

substantial difficulty sleeping;

•

difficulty concentrating, eg because of tiredness or severe migraines;

•

difficulty engaging in normal conversation because of tiredness or distraction of hot flushes;

•

persistently wanting to avoid people, eg because of embarrassment;

•

reduced ability to socialise because of accumulated tiredness;

•

persistent low motivation, eg because of depression (depression can be covered as a
disability in itself);

•

difficulty using the computer because of tiredness or headaches;

•

difficulty completing housework because of lack of energy;

•

difficulty carrying out activities associated with toileting;

•

difficulty using transport, eg because of a frequent need for the lavatory;

•

difficulty lifting full shopping bags because of muscle weakness and cramps;

•

inability to stay awake through a film;

•

a combination of various effects.

15.109 A woman needs to show any effects are substantial, which means not

trivial. This may require spelling it out. An occasional inability to
sleep or very minor infrequent hot flushes may not be considered
sufficient. If the symptoms are lessened by HRT, then the relevant
effect is what it would be without the HRT.
15.110
Depending on how a woman is affected by the menopause,
reasonable adjustments could include:221
•

Sleep disruption: allowing short-term absence, temporary shift swaps, ad hoc home
working, and flexible hours.

•

Hot flushes / daytime sweats: desk fans, adjusted air conditioning, desk near window,
drinking water, adapted uniform (looser / natural fabrics), limiting time on duties which

require personal protective equipment (PPE).222
•

Headaches / fatigue: quiet areas to work, access to private rest areas, regular breaks,
flexible break times, temporary adjustment to duties.

•

Heavy / irregular periods / urinary problems: easy access to washrooms, more frequent
toilet breaks, extra uniform, ad hoc home working.

•

Loss of confidence / anxiety / loss of concentration: quiet time when needed, quiet
workspace, homeworking, agreed protected time to catch up with work.

15.111 Unjustifiably dismissing a woman because of conduct or capability

which arises from her menopause could be discrimination under
section 15.223 Bearing in mind that some women may be reticent to
mention to their managers that they have menopausal symptoms,
remember that it will be necessary to establish that the employer had
the requisite knowledge for disability discrimination claims (see
above).

Once the claimant proves facts from which a tribunal could
conclude there was discrimination in the absence of an
explanation, the burden of proof moves to the employer to
prove s/he did not discriminate.
It is not necessary to apply the two-stage burden of proof in
obvious cases.
Where appropriate, the employment tribunal (ET) must take
account of the employer’s failure to follow a relevant part of
the discrimination Codes in deciding whether the employer has
a case to answer.
Employers rarely admit discrimination and often deny it, even
to themselves.
The ET can infer direct discrimination from a variety of factors,
eg a pattern of incidents, racist remarks, inadequate
explanations, statistics, wholly unexplained unreasonable
behaviour, and most importantly, actual or evidential
comparators.
The best evidence is an actual comparator, ie another worker
of a different race, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation or
without a disability, who has been treated differently (ie better)
in comparable circumstances.
A hypothetical comparison can be made where there are no
actual comparators or only evidential, ie loosely comparable,

The burden of proof in discrimination cases
16.1

16.2

The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the normal civil
standard, namely whether, on the balance of probabilities (ie ‘more
likely than not’), discrimination occurred. The employment tribunal
(ET) should be reminded of this at the hearing.
As a result of various European Union (EU) directives, the burden
of proof shifts onto the employer once the worker has proved a
‘prima facie’ case.1 The burden of proof is set out in Equality Act
(EqA) 2010 s136 which, to paraphrase, reads as follows:
If there are facts from which the ET could decide, in the absence of any other explanation,
that the employer contravened the provision concerned, the ET must hold that the
contravention occurred. However, this does not apply if the employer shows that s/he did
not contravene the provision.

16.3

The Court of Appeal in Igen Ltd and others v Wong; Chamberlin
Solicitors and another v Emokpae; Brunel University v Webster2
set out guidance on the stages which an ET should follow. Although
the guidelines were expressed in terms of a sex discrimination case
under the former Sex Discrimination Act (SDA) 1975, the same
principles apply under the EqA 2010 to all forms of discrimination,
subject to the qualifiers set out below. The Court of Appeal said the
ET must go through a two-stage process: At stage 1, the claimant
must prove facts from which the ET could conclude, in the absence
of an adequate explanation from the respondent (employer), that the
respondent had discriminated against the claimant. In deciding
whether the claimant has proved these facts, the ET can take account
of the respondent’s evidence. At stage 2, the respondent must prove
s/he did not commit that discrimination. Although there are two

stages, ETs will generally wish to hear all the evidence in one go,
including the respondent’s explanation, before deciding whether the
requirements of each stage are satisfied. The full guidelines are as
follows.
1)

Pursuant to SDA 1975 s63A,3 it is for the claimant4 who complains of sex discrimination
to prove, on the balance of probabilities, facts from which the tribunal could conclude, in
the absence of an adequate explanation, that the respondent has committed an act of
discrimination against the claimant which is unlawful by virtue of Part II or which by
virtue of section 41 or section 42 of the SDA 1975 is to be treated as having been
committed against the claimant. These are referred to below as ‘such facts’.

2)

If the claimant does not prove such facts, s/he will fail.

3)

It is important to bear in mind in deciding whether the claimant has proved such facts that
it is unusual to find direct evidence of sex discrimination. Few employers would be
prepared to admit such discrimination, even to themselves. In some cases, the
discrimination will not be an intention but merely based on the assumption that ‘the
claimant would not have fitted in’.

4)

In deciding whether the claimant has proved such facts, it is important to remember that
the outcome at this stage of the analysis by the tribunal will, therefore, usually depend on
what inferences it is proper to draw from the primary facts found by the tribunal.

5)

It is important to note the word ‘could’ in SDA 1975 s63A(2).5 At this stage, the tribunal
does not have to reach a definitive determination that such facts would lead it to the
conclusion that there was an act of unlawful discrimination. The tribunal is looking at the
primary facts before it to see what inferences of secondary fact could be drawn from
them.

6)

In considering what inferences or conclusions can be drawn from the primary facts, the
tribunal must assume that there is no adequate explanation for those facts.

7)

These inferences can include, in appropriate cases, any inferences that it is just and
equitable to draw in accordance with section 74(2)(b) of the SDA 1975 from an evasive
or equivocal reply to a questionnaire or any other questions that fall within section 74(2) of
the SDA 1975.6

8)

Likewise, the tribunal must decide whether any provision of any relevant Code of Practice
is relevant and, if so, take it into account in determining, such facts pursuant to section
56A(10) of the SDA 1975.7 This means that inferences may also be drawn from any
failure to comply with any relevant Code of Practice.

9)

Where the claimant has proved facts from which conclusions could be drawn that the
respondent has treated the claimant less favourably on the ground of sex, then the burden
of proof moves to the respondent.

10) It is then for the respondent to prove that s/he did not commit, or as the case may be, is
not to be treated as having committed, that act.
11) To discharge that burden it is necessary for the respondent to prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that the treatment was in no sense whatsoever on the grounds of sex, since
‘no discrimination whatsoever’ is compatible with the Burden of Proof Directive.8
12) That requires a tribunal to assess not merely whether the respondent has proved an
explanation for the facts from which such inferences can be drawn, but further that it is
adequate to discharge the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that sex was not
a ground for the treatment in question.
13) Since the facts necessary to prove an explanation would normally be in the possession of
the respondent, a tribunal would normally expect cogent evidence to discharge that burden
of proof. In particular, the tribunal will need to examine carefully explanations for failure
to deal with the questionnaire procedure9 and/or code of practice.
16.4

16.5

16.6

Note that stage 1 of the burden of proof (guidelines 1)–8)) requires
the claimant to prove facts from which the tribunal could conclude
that the respondent has committed an act of discrimination – not
simply that the respondent could have committed an act of
discrimination. Regarding stage 2 of the burden of proof (guidelines
9)–13)), it is not necessary for the tribunal to go as far as rejecting
the respondent’s explanation; the respondent will not have
discharged the burden of proof if the tribunal simply says it was not
persuaded by its explanation.10
Although the burden of proof is on the claimant at stage 1, the
tribunal should take account of all evidence that is in front of it, not
only evidence produced by the claimant.11
What facts are sufficient to potentially suggest discrimination in
the absence of an adequate explanation from the employer (stage 1)?
This is often referred to as having a ‘prima facie’ case. Ideally, the
worker can identify an actual comparator of a different race, sex, etc
who has been treated differently or better in similar circumstances.12
However, by way of an example, it may not be enough to shift the
burden of proof simply that a white comparator was promoted to a

post for which a black worker had applied. It seems the black
worker would also have to have met the stated requirements of the
post and was at least as well qualified as the white comparator.13
Other examples where it may be legitimate for an ET to find a prima
facie case so that the burden of proof shifts are:
•

where a black woman is not selected for one of five posts following a reorganisation in
circumstances where all the successful candidates are white men with whom she is equally
qualified. It may be different if a number of equally qualified white candidates have also
been rejected;14

•

where a woman is allocated only three projects out of over 200 following her gender
reassignment, compared with a large allocation previously;15

•

where an employer dismisses a black employee for an offence which has equally been
committed by his/her white colleagues; has failed to investigate his/her allegation of race
discrimination and has been evasive in replying to his/her questionnaire;16

•

where an employer asks an employee rhetorically whether it is his age that caused him not
to be able to work to expectations and comments that ‘you can’t teach an old dog new
tricks’, even if there is no other evidence of age discrimination in the criticism of the
employee’s performance;17

•

where on closure of one site, two employees in their 30s are offered transfer to vacancies
on another site; the claimant who is aged 64 is not offered a third vacancy, which is
eventually filled by external recruitment; and the decision-maker falsely tells the tribunal
that he had offered the claimant a transfer which the claimant refused.18

16.7

The Court of Appeal in Madarassy said that the mere fact of a
difference in protected characteristic and a difference in treatment
will not be enough to shift the burden of proof. There needs to be
‘something more’. There has to be enough evidence from which a
reasonable tribunal could properly conclude, if unexplained, that
discrimination has (not could have) occurred.19 The need for
‘something more’ is often raised by employers defending
discrimination claims, but it is a vague concept. If too much ‘more’
is required, the shifting burden of proof will not operate as intended
by the EU directives. The better treatment of a comparator is usually
good evidence if the circumstances are such that one would have
expected the worker and the comparator to have been treated the

16.8

16.9

16.10

same way. Perhaps those circumstances constitute the required
‘more’. So, for example, if a 57-year-old employee is dismissed for
poor performance, while a younger employee is retained, this fact
alone is highly unlikely to shift the burden of proof for a case of age
discrimination. However, if the evidence indicated that the
performance of the employee and his comparator was at a similar
level, this could be the ‘more’ which makes the burden of proof shift.
Or to take another example, it may not be enough to shift the burden
of proof on sex discrimination that a woman has been disciplined for
misconduct, whereas a male colleague has not. However, if the
employer was aware that they had both committed the same offence,
that might be sufficient to constitute the required ‘more’. Arguably, to
require any further indicators of sex discrimination in that scenario
would make the shifting burden of proof redundant. See also the
examples in the previous paragraph.
Where there is no actual comparator or overt racist, sexist or
ageist remarks etc, the prima facie case needs to be established from
other evidence,20 eg a woman who is well-qualified for a job and
meets the person specification, is not even interviewed. Further
examples of the type of evidence which could lead to an inference of
discrimination are set out in the rest of this chapter.
In deciding whether stage 1 of the burden of proof has been met,
although the ET must disregard the employer’s explanation, it can
take into account other evidence from the employer which discredits
or puts the claimant’s facts into context, for example, evidence that
the alleged discriminator treats all employees equally badly.21
Some employers argue after the claimant’s evidence at the ET
hearing that it is not necessary for them to provide any explanation
because stage 1 has not been met. However, discrimination cases are
best looked at as a whole. The ET will usually want to hear the
employer’s evidence and explanation and the worker should have the
opportunity of questioning the employer’s witnesses.22 Very often a
claimant may not be sure what lies behind something that concerns
him/her and it can only be decided after evidence has been given.23

16.11

16.12

In indirect discrimination cases, the claimant must point to a
provision, criterion or practice (PCP) with discriminatory impact
which disadvantages him/her and others sharing the same relevant
protected characteristic. Once this is shown, if the employer seeks to
claim that a discriminatory practice is justifiable, it is for the
employer to prove it is a proportionate means of achieving a
legitimate aim. Note the above comments regarding the wording of
EqA 2010 s136 in relation to the burden of proof.
The shifting burden of proof is very important where it is uncertain
if there is enough evidence to prove discrimination. However, it is
artificial and unnecessary where the evidence is very clear one way
or another.24 One of the problems with the burden of proof is the
question whether an employer’s unconvincing or lack of explanation
can be a matter which helps shift the burden of proof. The wording of
section 136 suggests possibly not. However, if the tribunal looks at
all matters together, albeit with the burden remaining on the claimant,
a poor or contradictory explanation should be able to go into the mix
from the outset. Unfortunately the key cases are difficult to reconcile
and do not explicitly state the effect of not applying section 136 in
this context.25

Helpful kinds of evidence in discrimination
cases
Direct discrimination
Introduction
16.13

In King,26 the Court of Appeal said that as direct evidence of
discrimination is rarely available, the necessary evidence will
‘usually depend on what inferences it is proper to draw from the
primary facts’. In other words, the ET must look for clues and draw
conclusions. The concept of the ET drawing ‘inferences’ is central to
running a discrimination case. Since such an indirect approach is
necessary, a wide range of evidence may seem relevant. Choosing
which evidence to use in a case is important. A good case can
become discredited by taking weak points. Excessive and

inconclusive evidence clouds the real issues and lengthens the
hearing.
Other acts of discrimination
16.14

16.15

Every act of discrimination within the three months prior to lodging
an ET127 may form the basis of a claim. However, acts or indicators
of discrimination falling outside the time limit may be mentioned in
the claim purely as evidence in support of the discriminatory acts
founding the claim.28 For clarity, it should be stated which acts form
the basis of the claim. Earlier alleged acts of discrimination will
usually be helpful only if they took place relatively recently and
relate to the same managers. Acts of discrimination or evidence of
discriminatory attitudes occurring after the acts founding the claim
are also admissible as supporting evidence of a tendency to
discriminate.29 Indicators from a time before or after a particular
decision, eg not to promote, may indicate that an ostensibly fair
decision was made because of a protected characteristic.30 Workers
would be well advised not to overload their claims with too many
incidents, whether forming the basis of the claim or supporting
evidence. There is a great danger that the best evidence will get lost
in the welter of information, and cases become very long and
expensive, with increasing costs risks if they lose.31 When
considering whether to add in a further incident, the worker should
think about how much that incident, in itself or added together with
other incidents, helps prove the key discrimination. Does it add
anything? If the main incidents do not convince the tribunal, will
adding this one make any difference?
Where the worker mentions a number of out-of-time incidents as
evidence supporting the claim, the ET should not look at each
incident in isolation to decide if it was itself discriminatory. In such
a case, it is important to draw the ET’s attention to the Employment
Appeal Tribunal’s (EAT’s) guidance in Qureshi v (1) Victoria
University of Manchester (2) Brazier.32 The ET should find the
primary facts about all the incidents and then look at the totality of
those facts, including the employer’s explanations, in order to decide

whether to infer the acts complained of in the ET1 were because of
the protected characteristic. To adopt a fragmented approach ‘would
inevitably have the effect of diminishing any eloquence that the
cumulative effect of the primary facts might have’ as to whether
actions were because of the protected characteristic.
The employer’s explanation
16.16

16.17

The employer’s likely explanation for what has happened must be
anticipated, as it will have to be discredited. If, for example, a
worker has clearly committed a dismissable offence or is obviously
the least qualified and experienced for an appointment or promotion,
then it will be extremely difficult to prove unlawful discrimination,
even if it could be shown that the employer was generally prejudiced
against workers with the same protected characteristic. The issue is
less favourable treatment and if, for example, a man would similarly
have been dismissed for the same offence, it is irrelevant that the
employer was pleased to have the opportunity to dismiss a woman.
Where the alleged act of discrimination is dismissal, the ET may
wonder whether the case is an attempt to claim unfair dismissal for a
worker without the necessary qualifying service. It must therefore be
remembered that the ET is not interested in whether or not the
dismissal was fair, but whether it was on the discriminatory
ground.33 Direct discrimination is not about unfair treatment, it is
about different treatment. However, unreasonable conduct by an
employer is not completely irrelevant. An inference of unlawful
discrimination can be drawn from the employer’s inability to explain
unreasonable treatment of the worker.34 Also, in some cases it can be
argued that the dismissal was so patently unfair as to be irrational
unless explained by hidden grounds. An ET should not assume
without evidence that the employer behaves equally badly to
employees of all races etc.35 Even so, it is advisable for the claimant
to prove that the employer is not normally unreasonable with other
workers or to show some further evidence indicating unlawful
discrimination. ETs should take care before accepting an employer’s
explanation that the reason for the less favourable treatment of the

16.18

16.19

16.20

claimant is general inefficiency or poor administration.36 This could
be a mask for direct discrimination. Tribunals can also infer
discrimination from untrue or inconsistent explanations.37
Discrimination cases are more than usually dependent on the
quality of the employer’s evidence at the hearing, which makes their
outcome hard to predict. Much will depend on how well the
employer’s explanation stands up to cross-examination. Any
contradiction between different witnesses for the employer, or
between the explanation given at the hearing and that in any
contemporaneous document or in the tribunal defence, may well lead
the ET to infer discrimination was because of a protected
characteristic. However, it will not usually be enough simply to
discredit the employer’s version of events; some other indication of
unlawful discrimination will also be required.
When listening to the employer’s explanation, the ET should not
simply consider whether the witnesses sound credible or honest. A
witness can be credible, honest – and mistaken.38 The fact that the
employer had a genuine belief that the claimant was guilty of
misconduct does not mean s/he has discharged the burden of proving
s/he did not discriminate. That would fail to appreciate the insidious
nature of discrimination.39 Witnesses do not generally advertise their
prejudices.40 Indeed, very little discrimination today is overt or even
deliberate.41 Witnesses can be unconsciously prejudiced.42
An ET should recognise that an employer may discriminate against
one minority ethnic group even though s/he may not discriminate
against another. The fact that a person is married to a black woman,
for example, is not indicative of whether he would racially abuse an
Irish worker.43 There is no legal reason why a manager could not
discriminate against a worker of the same racial group as
him/herself, but it is a factor to be taken into account.44 The ET will
no doubt be wondering why such discrimination would have
happened. However, it is quite possible to envisage that a black
businessperson may hire a white salesperson in order to appeal to
white customers; or that a black junior manager may feel isolated and
under pressure to be accepted within a white dominant organisation.

Comparative treatment
16.21

16.22

The central concept in direct discrimination is that of actual or
hypothetical comparative treatment. The question is whether the
worker was less favourably treated than an actual or hypothetical
comparator without his/her relevant protected characteristic. Such
comparison must be made where there is no material difference in
the circumstances of the case of the worker and the comparator.45 For
example, if a female police constable fails her probation on grounds
of dishonesty, the comparator is an actual or hypothetical male police
constable who has his probation confirmed, despite having
committed the same kind of dishonesty. Obviously if an actual
worker without the relevant protected characteristic can be identified
who, in similar circumstances, was treated more favourably, then the
case will be much stronger. It then becomes a question of whether the
employer can provide a credible innocent explanation for the
different treatment. The circumstances of the claimant and of his/her
comparator need not be precisely the same and it is up to the tribunal
to decide whether the situations were in fact comparable.46
In most cases it is impossible to find a real life comparator where
all the relevant circumstances are the same, so the ET must consider
how a hypothetical comparator would have been treated.47 Indeed,
even where the worker has real comparators, it is safest also to
claim that, in the alternative, s/he was less favourably treated than a
hypothetical comparator would have been. A hypothetical
comparator is simply someone who is the same as the worker in all
relevant ways except that s/he is of a different race, sex, age, etc. To
decide how a hypothetical comparator would have been treated, it is
necessary to look at all the evidence pointing to race, sex, age, etc
discrimination – eg dubious remarks, inadequate explanations and
general statistics. In particular, the ET can look at how the employer
has treated others in loosely similar but not identical
circumstances.48 As long as the ET understands that these
comparisons are not being put forward as actual comparators, it is
perfectly legitimate to use them as ‘building blocks’ in constructing
how the hypothetical identical comparator would have been

treated.49 Sometimes the term used for these less precise
comparators is ‘evidential comparators’.50 Using the example above,
it would be useful to look at a male police constable who had passed
his probation when there was evidence that he was not competent at
the job. Although incapability is not the same as dishonesty, it would
be one indicator of whether the employer is generally lenient
towards men as opposed to women.
Where an actual comparator or even a loosely similar comparator
is found, try to anticipate the employer’s explanation for treating
him/her better than the worker. For example, the explanation could
be differences in:

16.23

16.24

16.25

•

relevant experience;

•

relevant qualifications;

•

prior disciplinary record;

•

status;

•

whether an internal or external candidate for a post.

In a recruitment case, if a Jobcentre or recruitment agency was
involved, it should be asked what job description or advert the
employer supplied. Where someone fails to gain a post after
interview, despite having equal or better qualifications and
experience than the person appointed, it is common for the employer
to say that the successful candidate interviewed better. This is
extremely difficult to contradict. All notes made by the interview
panel in relation to each candidate during or after the interviews
should be obtained. Also, while the interview is still fresh in his/her
mind, the worker should note down the questions and answers as
near verbatim as possible.
It may be relevant to know how the employer generally treats male
and female workers or workers from different racial groups etc, in
circumstances other than those of the alleged discriminatory act. It
may be that an employer generally speaks more politely to white
workers than to black workers, or that black workers are penalised
for arriving late to work whereas white workers are not. In West
Midlands Passenger Transport Executive v Singh,51 the Court of

16.26

Appeal said that evidence of discriminatory treatment against a
group may be more indicative of unlawful discrimination than
previous treatment of the particular worker, which may be due to
personal factors other than discrimination. Sometimes it is
appropriate, as in Singh, to request statistics showing comparative
treatment of groups of workers.
It may also be helpful to show that the worker has been treated
differently from an expected norm, eg the employers have not
followed their own written disciplinary or grievance procedure on
this occasion.
Statistics

16.27

Statistics showing that a group with particular protected
characteristics tend to get treated less favourably may be very
helpful, though it does not necessarily follow that an individual
within the group has been discriminated against on any particular
occasion. The Singh case established the potential importance of
statistical evidence in cases of direct discrimination. The Court of
Appeal said:
Direct discrimination involves that an individual is not treated on his merits but receives
unfavourable treatment because he is a member of a group. Statistical evidence may
establish a discernible pattern in the treatment of a particular group.52

16.28

Mr Singh claimed racial discrimination in his failure to gain
promotion to the post of senior inspector. The court said that if
statistics revealed a regular failure of members of a certain group to
gain promotion to certain jobs and an under-representation in such
jobs, it may give rise to an inference of discrimination against
members of the group.
Statistics can be obtained by way of additional information or
disclosure.53 These procedures are more important now that the
statutory questionnaire procedure has been abolished.54 If statistical
evidence is not available because, for example, an employer has not
monitored the workforce and applications for employment and
promotion, the ET could be invited to draw an adverse inference

from this fact. In reality, although monitoring is recommended by the
Equality and Human Rights Commission Employment Code (see
below) and encouraged by the higher courts,55 it is unlikely an ET
will draw an inference from failure to monitor unless there is
something surprising about it. It may be different in respect of public
authorities who should be monitoring as good practice under the
general public sector equality duty (PSED) and explicitly under the
Welsh and Scottish specific duties.56
Failure to follow the Codes of Practice
16.29

16.30

16.31

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Employment
and Equal Pay Codes of Practice are admissible in evidence and an
ET must take into account relevant provisions of the Codes in
determining any question in the proceedings.57 Part 2 of the EHRC
Employment Code makes many recommendations on good practice,
eg in recruitment and promotion procedures and addressing workers’
needs while at work. In cases concerning discrimination in all these
areas, the employer’s practices and procedures should be examined
to see whether the guidelines of the codes have been followed.
Interesting parts of the Equality and Human Rights Commission
Employment Code include paras 17.44–17.51 on language in the
workplace; paras 17.33–17.38 on annual leave policies; and
appendix 2, which encourages monitoring by employers. Paragraphs
17.94–17.97 of the Code deal with grievances and it is strongly
recommended that employers properly investigate complaints of
discrimination. The ET’s attention should be drawn to those
provisions, where the worker has complained of discrimination at
some stage during his/her employment, including the final
disciplinary hearing, and has been ignored.
An ET should not infer that discrimination has occurred purely
from an employer’s failure to follow his/her own equal opportunities
policy,58 but poor practice in recruitment procedures is likely to be a
significant factor.

Racist (and equivalent) remarks / overt indications of
prejudice
16.32

16.33

16.34

Although prejudice need not be present to prove discrimination,59 it
strengthens the case if it is demonstrably present, eg because racist
remarks have been made. Difficulties often arise because it is only
the worker’s word and s/he can be accused of making up such
remarks while giving evidence. It is therefore important that any
crucial remarks are mentioned in the ET1 form from the start.
Another difficulty is that certain words, ‘jokes’ or actions may not
be taken as indicative of a racist, sexist or ageist, etc attitude by the
ET. Even if they are, a tribunal will not automatically conclude that
prejudiced attitudes lead to discriminatory treatment. In an
appointment or promotion case, an employer’s comment that
someone ‘who would fit in’ was wanted should be regarded as a
danger signal.60 In certain cases, racist or similar comments may
themselves constitute one of the acts of discrimination basing the
claim.61
Things said by an employer in a ‘without prejudice’ negotiation
can sometimes be very revealing. Normally, without prejudice
discussions are kept off the record from the ET,62 but the rule will
not apply if ‘unambiguous impropriety’ took place, eg racist remarks
were made during the conversation.63 However, that only applies
where words were said which were unambiguously discriminatory,
as opposed to more neutral words which could be interpreted as
evidence of a discriminatory attitude.64
Previous complaints of discrimination

16.35

Documented previous complaints of unlawful discrimination against
relevant managers should constitute useful evidence, particularly if
the employer has failed to investigate such allegations. There are
many and obvious reasons why a worker may not complain of
discrimination while still employed. Nevertheless, a worker who
alleges that discrimination has been occurring for some time is likely
to be heavily cross-examined on why s/he did not complain at the

16.36

time, the implication being that s/he has made it up after the event.
The worker should be prepared to answer this question at the
hearing. For the same reason, even if discrimination has not
previously been mentioned, it is advisable for a worker to raise it at
any dismissal hearing.
Where a worker during employment seeks advice in respect of
discrimination, legal proceedings will usually be regarded as a last
resort. However, s/he should be advised of the risks of not recording
the allegation in writing, should some issue of discrimination
ultimately end up in the ET. If appropriate, the employer’s attention
could be expressly drawn to the prohibition on victimisation in the
legislation. The worker may also risk having compensation reduced
under the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
Code on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures if s/he wins a later
discrimination case, if s/he unreasonably did not bring a grievance
first.
Pregnancy

16.37

Useful evidence to prove pregnancy discrimination includes:
remarks indicating the employer or relevant manager is unhappy
about the pregnancy; a generally unhelpful attitude to time off for
antenatal care or discussions about maternity leave and return; less
favourable treatment of the woman compared with other staff;
different treatment of the woman compared with how she was treated
on similar issues before she became pregnant; a generally
unfavourable environment in the workplace or in the woman’s own
department towards pregnant women or mothers of young children.
Various reports into pregnancy discrimination in recent years are
useful evidence of a wider pattern.65

Indirect discrimination
Proving others of the worker’s group are disadvantaged
16.38

Traditionally, statistical evidence is necessary in an indirect
discrimination case to prove that the PCP particularly disadvantages

16.39

those with a certain protected characteristic. Changes in the wording
of the definition of indirect discrimination over the years mean that
other types of evidence to prove disadvantage may sometimes be
acceptable, eg expert evidence and research reports. Nevertheless,
where possible, it is usually advisable still to present statistical
evidence, as alternative methods may be less convincing.66 The ET
can take account of its own knowledge and experience in determining
whether a PCP has disparate impact.67 In indirect sex discrimination
cases, the EAT has said that a woman does not need to prove the
‘childcare disparity’, ie that women bear the greater burden of
childcare responsibilities, and that this can limit their ability to work
certain hours, eg nights or changeable hours. However, a woman will
still need to prove that the particular type of flexible working
arrangement in question would put women at a disadvantage
compared with men.68 Certain arrangements might not be more
difficult for people with childcare responsibilities. Generally it is
best to play safe – an ET may unexpectedly insist on evidential proof
of apparently obvious facts, so always come prepared. It is wellestablished that determining the correct pool for comparison of the
impact on people of different groups is a question of fact for the ET.
The ET may choose a pool not anticipated by the worker and catch
him/her unprepared. It may be possible to avoid this difficulty by
agreeing a pool with the employer prior to the hearing or even asking
the tribunal to decide the matter at a preliminary hearing. However, it
is wise to prepare statistics on all the potential pools. Clearly some
pools will be more helpful than others, and less helpful pools which
the ET might choose should therefore be anticipated with, if
possible, explanations as to why they are misleading or irrelevant,
for example, because they incorporate discrimination.
Where to find statistics or other evidence on impact

16.40

As stated above, statistics need to be gathered to show adverse
impact within every likely pool for comparison. The statistics must
relate to those with and without the relevant protected characteristic
within each of the possible pools. One of the difficulties with

16.41

indirect discrimination cases is that statistics are rarely available to
meet the exact purpose. Where directly relevant statistics are not
available, other statistics or evidence, from which the relevant facts
may be inferred, should be used.
Statistics on any workplace pool may be obtainable by asking the
tribunal for an order for additional information, eg as to how many of
the existing workforce, by reference to sex, work part-time or fulltime and how many women left after having children.
Statistics and evidence can be obtained from various sources, eg
the Low Pay Commission, the Child Poverty Action Group,
Stonewall, Carers UK, the Fawcett Society, the Women’s Resource
Centre, the Muslim Council of Britain, the Board of Deputies of
British Jews, the Trades Union Congress (TUC), trade unions and
university research departments, libraries, the Joint Council for the
Welfare of Immigrants and community groups. The EHRC may
advise on available reports and statistical sources and has
publications on its website.69 Official statistics are available from
the Office for National Statistics (ONS)and also on the GOV.UK
site.70 Labour Force Surveys contain detailed statistics on patterns of
full-time and part-time work by single and married men and
women.71 Local authority social services should have statistics on
childcare facilities and take-up. Carers UK has information and
statistics regarding carers on its website, including research into the
general profile of caring, and employment and caring.72 The official
statistics are another route to access information on carers. The
(usually) annual Modern Families Index published by Working
Families looks at how families combine work and family life.73
There are also reports on the effect on working mothers of the
Covid-19 pandemic, including loss of childcare and the burden of
home-schooling.74 Research reports or articles in specialist
publications such as the Nursing Times on the position of black
workers in the NHS, are useful for direct and indirect discrimination
cases.
Where there is no statistical or research evidence precisely on the
point required, verbal evidence from ‘experts’ or respected members

of the community may be useful.
Justifiability
16.44

The greater the discriminatory effect, the better the justification the
employer needs. Although the onus is on the employer to justify the
PCP, it is still useful for the worker to produce evidence of the extent
of its discriminatory effect. It will also be useful if the worker is
able to put forward any reasonable alternative ways with less
discriminatory effects by which the employer could have achieved
his/her objectives. The EHRC Employment Code provides guidance
on what should be considered unjustifiable in a variety of situations.

Victimisation
16.45

The worker first needs to establish that the ‘protected act’ took
place. This may be difficult if his/her complaint of discrimination
was made verbally. In order to show that the worker was victimised
as a result, it is useful to prove that the employer’s behaviour
towards the worker was different before and after doing the
protected act. It is worth doing a chronology of the key facts. The
timing of events is particularly revealing in victimisation cases. It is
also helpful to prove that the employer has treated the worker less
favourably than s/he has treated other workers (who have not made
allegations of discrimination) in similar circumstances. This is the
same concept of comparators as for direct discrimination cases.75
Although in victimisation cases it is no longer legally required to
compare the worker’s treatment with that of a comparator, it is still
useful evidence to help prove the reason why the worker has been
subjected to a detriment is because of the protected act.

Witnesses
16.46

The principles are the same as in other ET cases. However, there is
little doubt that independent witnesses in discrimination cases
(particularly if they do not have the same relevant protected
characteristic as the worker) can vastly increase the chances of

success. If witnesses are called on any point of detail, the adviser
should check what they will say if asked whether they believe
unlawful discrimination has taken place. Witnesses may not
understand what amounts to discrimination under the law. Although it
is only a matter of their opinion, it will harm the worker’s case if
his/her witnesses consider that discrimination has not occurred.

Helpful kinds of evidence in disability
discrimination cases
Introduction
16.47

In addition to the general content of this chapter, there are additional
considerations which are relevant to disability. The EHRC
Employment Code applies to disability as it does to all the protected
characteristics. Chapters 5 and 6 of the Code cover the two
definitions which are unique to disability ie discrimination arising
from disability and failure to make reasonable adjustments. In
relation to proving whether the worker has a disability, the Office for
Disability Issues Guidance relating to the definition of disability
must also be taken into account.76 Chapter 15 in this book refers in
detail to the provisions of the guidance.

Proving the disability
Overview
16.48

In most cases, the worker will need to prove that s/he has a disability
as defined by the EqA 2010. The employer’s first response in
defending a case is almost always to deny that the worker has a
disability within the meaning of the Act and to require him/her to
prove it. Even if the employer concedes that the worker has a
disability, it is not guaranteed that the tribunal will accept that this is
the case, though it will be unusual not to. There are further hidden
dangers when an employer does make a concession. It is important to
pin down in writing exactly what disability the employer concedes
the worker had and for what time period. There is also the risk that

the worker forgets s/he still has to prove the effect of his/her
disability on his/her ability to do the job. This will not only need
detailed evidence from the worker but may also still require medical
evidence. For the law on each stage of the definition, see paras 15.8–
15.33. See also the checklist on the definition of disability in
appendix A. The following is a guide to gathering evidence by
reference to the stages of the definition, bearing in mind the
developing case-law.
Mental impairment
16.49

Since December 2005, it has no longer been necessary to prove that
a mental illness is clinically well-recognised. Nevertheless, it is still
important to get medical evidence of the impairment and its effects,
and it is usually helpful (though no longer essential) if a wellrecognised illness can be identified. Workers and their GPs tend to
use words like ‘anxiety’, ‘stress’ and ‘nervous debility’. These are
the names of symptoms, but not necessarily of impairments in
themselves. Simply producing copies of medical certificates using
such vague terms at the ET will not be enough. Note also that the ET
must not try to judge for itself whether the worker has a mental
illness from the way s/he gives evidence on the day.77 Quite apart
from any risk of suspected but non-existent play-acting by the
claimant, symptoms of mental illness can fluctuate and tribunal
members are not psychiatric experts. Evidence of mental impairment
apart from illness, eg learning difficulties, can be provided by an
educational psychologist or other suitable expert, not only by
doctors.78
Substantial adverse effect on ability to carry out day-to-day
activities

16.50

The worker must prove that the impairment has a substantial adverse
effect on his/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.
Remember that this means ‘normal’ activities and not specialised
hobbies. Specialist work activities may or may not be covered, so it
is best to get as many examples as possible on activities in and

16.51

16.52

16.53

outside work. A good starting point is to go through paras D11–D17
of the Guidance79 and its appendix with the worker, discussing the
examples of what may and may not have substantial adverse effect.
Do not stop with those examples. They should give the worker and
the adviser ideas for other examples. Although it is an undesirably
negative approach, the more examples of things the worker cannot
do, the easier it is to prove disability. Explain to the worker that
unfortunately this is how the law works.
It is not simply a question of what the worker cannot do at all.
There is also an adverse effect if s/he can only do certain activities
with difficulty, eg in pain, extremely slowly, with great tiredness or
in an unusual way. For example, a worker may be able to walk up ten
steps, but only if s/he pauses for breath at each step. Or a worker
may be able to carry a bag, but only if it is on his/her shoulder rather
than in his/her hand. Any effect which is not minor or trivial is
relevant.80
As already stated in relation to mental impairment, there is a risk
that a tribunal will reach the wrong conclusions regarding the effects
of a worker’s disability from observing the way s/he looks or
behaves at the hearing. It is important to anticipate and ask the
worker to explain any potentially misleading impressions, eg the fact
that the worker sits for a long period while giving evidence, does not
mean that s/he is not in pain, or s/he may have taken painkillers. An
ET should not disregard the uncontradicted evidence of a medical
expert without good reason.81 Equally, it should be very cautious
about substituting its observations for what is stated in the report of a
jointly-instructed expert.82
Do not make assumptions that because the worker has a wellknown disability, the ET will accept s/he is disabled or assume that
s/he cannot do certain activities. Most disabilities have a huge range
of effects on the individual, from extremely mild to very severe.
Each worker must be consulted as an individual. However, it does
help if the adviser has some knowledge, to ask the right questions.
Introductory knowledge can often be gained from the many excellent
websites of specialist organisations. Such organisations can be found

16.54

by doing an internet search, eg using an internet search engine, typing
in the name of the disability ‘AND organisation’.
Remember that a worker is covered whose symptoms are
controlled by medication or other medical treatment if, apart from
that treatment, his/her impairment would have substantial adverse
effects.83 It is particularly important to get clear medical evidence to
prove such ‘deduced’ effects. It is not enough for the worker to make
his/her own speculation in the ET as to what would happen if the
treatment stopped.84
Progressive conditions

16.55

A worker with a progressive condition is covered as soon as there
are any symptoms, provided s/he can prove it is ‘likely’ that s/he
will go on to develop a substantial adverse effect.85 It is not enough
for the worker simply to prove s/he has a progressive condition such
as rheumatoid arthritis. Such a condition will not necessarily become
serious for every individual. The best way to prove it is likely to
become serious is to get a medical report on the worker’s own
condition. This can be difficult, especially if using the doctors
treating him/her, as they may not want to be negative. When getting
medical evidence, tell the doctors what is the correct legal threshold
for ‘likely’, ie it only means it ‘could well happen’. It need not be
‘more probable than not’.86 In some cases, it will be enough to
provide statistical evidence showing how the condition in question
usually develops. However, it is risky to rely on this alone without
reference to the worker’s own particular circumstances.

Medical evidence
16.56

It has become unusual now to run a disability discrimination case
without the use of medical evidence. This does make the procedure
more expensive and time-consuming. See para 21.81 for the position
on getting the cost of a report covered by the ET. Usually it is
sufficient to produce a report, without bringing the doctor to the ET
hearing. However, if there is a difference of opinion between doctors

separately instructed by the worker and the employer, it may be a
disadvantage not to have oral evidence. Where a jointly-instructed
expert’s report has confirmed the worker’s symptoms, the worker
should not be cross-examined at the hearing on the basis that s/he is
exaggerating his/her symptoms without forewarning, so s/he has a
chance to ask the expert to attend.87
The EAT has set out guidelines for getting medical evidence in De
Keyser Ltd v Wilson.88 The key points are:

16.57

•

it is preferable for an expert to be jointly instructed by the employer and worker;

•

if one side cannot afford to share the cost of a joint expert, so that the other side goes
ahead and instructs their own expert, it is still a good idea if both sides agree the terms of
instruction;

•

the letter instructing an expert should set out in detail the questions which s/he should
answer and avoid partisanship;

•

the ET may set a timetable for instructing experts and getting their reports (this needs to be
a generous timetable as doctors are busy people and cannot be forced to keep to
deadlines);

•

if each side instructs their own expert, the experts should be encouraged to meet on an offthe-record basis and agree as many issues as possible. (It is rather unrealistic to expect this
to happen, both in terms of the experts’ time and willingness, and the costs to the parties.)

16.58

With these guidelines in mind, the ET will often set an extensive and
contingent timetable at an early stage for establishing whether the
worker has a disability, eg:
1) by a certain date, the worker will disclose to the employer his/her medical records;
2) within 14 days thereafter, the employer will state whether s/he admits the worker had a
disability at the material time;
3) if not, a joint expert will be instructed and a timetable is set out for agreeing on an expert,
writing the instructions, getting the report back, asking further questions and getting the
answers;
4) within 14 days of getting the final answers, the employer will state definitively whether s/he
concedes disability.

If it is still a matter of dispute, there will either be a preliminary
hearing exclusively to decide if the claimant was disabled or it will

16.59

16.60

be decided as part of the full hearing. To avoid delays, the ET will
usually require the other steps of case preparation (disclosure etc) to
continue at the same time as the gathering of medical evidence.
It is a matter of judgment on each case which is the most
appropriate course. When asking a doctor to provide a report,
remember that the letter of instructions to the doctor may have to be
disclosed to the employer and the ET. Make sure the letter does not
appear biased. Bearing in mind what the law requires to be proved,
ask the doctor a series of precise questions as to his/her medical
assessment. A doctor can only advise on medical aspects of a case,
not on an interpretation of the law.89 Ask the doctor to state on what
basis s/he knows the worker and is aware of his/her condition.
Enclose a written authority from the worker to write the report. It
will normally also be necessary to agree to pay the doctor’s
reasonable costs, but check what these are first. A sample letter to a
doctor is in appendix A at A18.
Although the EAT sets an ideal of a jointly instructed expert, it is
still common for each side to call their own expert. This is
especially so where the worker wants to get a medical report from
the doctor who has been treating him/her. The worker needs to
decide whether to get a report from his/her GP or specialist
consultant or from an independent specialist who s/he has not met
before. In the latter case, the independent specialist could be jointly
instructed (as mentioned above). The worker’s choice depends
partly on the nature of the evidence and the seriousness of the case. It
is usually tempting for workers to use their own doctors or
specialists, but this is not always a good idea. A GP can confirm the
history of his/her treatment of the worker and what s/he was told at
the time, but may not have specialist knowledge of the particular
condition, and may not be seen as independent. Sometimes workers’
own doctors are reluctant to give bad news, and they create a falsely
optimistic (or self-protective) report, which does not help workers
prove their true situation. They may also rely on sketchy and out-ofdate notes. On the other hand, a worker’s own doctor or specialist
obviously has credibility from having seen the worker over a period

16.61

16.62

of time and it may be unnecessary for the worker to attend a special
examination. GPs are perfectly well qualified to give evidence about
whether a worker has depression and their evidence should not be
ignored by an ET, although it may have less weight than that of an
expert consultant.90 Remember also that if the worker produces a
report, it is quite likely that the employer will in turn want to get
his/her own report. This will mean that the worker has to attend an
examination with a possibly hostile doctor.
If there is a preliminary hearing to discuss case management and
no expert has yet been instructed, the ET is most likely to follow the
De Keyser guidelines (see para 16.57) and suggest the employer and
worker jointly instruct an independent doctor and share the expense.
If this happens, make sure that the selection of the doctor is not made
solely by the employer; that the doctor has not had other dealings
with the employer; and that the doctor’s instructions are in neutral
terms and come equally from each party. Finding an independent
medical expert can be difficult. A consultant with the relevant
speciality can usually be found by asking the GP or one of the
teaching hospitals, but this may not be the best route. The expert must
also be willing and able (ideally with experience) to write a suitable
report; reliable in terms of timescale; and not too expensive. There
are some directories of experts, for example provided by the Law
Society of Scotland.91
Having said all this, a worker may choose not to get medical
evidence to prove his/her disability and its effects, and simply to
rely on his/her own evidence. It is not the tribunal’s job to insist on
the worker getting medical evidence,92 but it is of course a risk for a
worker not to back up his/her own assertions with more independent
and perhaps more accurate evidence regarding the effects of an
impairment. A tribunal may be tempted to help the worker out by
ordering the employer, who has more resources, to pay for a medical
expert, but this is not permitted.93 If an employment judge orders the
claimant to get a medical report, the tribunal administration may be
willing to pay the doctor’s fees up to a certain amount (see para
21.81).

Reasonable adjustments
16.63

It is best to take a methodical approach when trying to persuade a
tribunal that the employer has failed to make reasonable adjustments.
This is because the ET needs to identify:
1) the PCP or physical feature of the premises which is causing the worker difficulty;
2) the nature and extent of the disadvantage suffered by the worker;
3) any non-disabled comparators who are not placed at a disadvantage (where appropriate);
4) proposed adjustments and to what extent they might alleviate the disadvantage.94

16.64

To make sense of these stages, it is necessary to analyse with
sufficient detail the elements of the worker’s job and the effect of the
disability on carrying out each of the relevant tasks. The idea of step
3 is to show that the reason the worker is at a disadvantage is the
effect of the PCP etc on his/her disability. It should not be necessary
to find an actual non-disabled comparator in similar circumstances to
prove this point.95 When running a tribunal case (though not
necessarily at the time the problem at work arose), the worker must
give at least a broad idea of what kind of adjustments would have
been useful, so that the employer knows what allegation s/he has to
meet.96 Once it is established that there is an arrangement causing the
worker a substantial disadvantage because of his/her disability, s/he
needs to identify a potentially reasonable adjustment. When s/he has
done that, the burden of proof is reversed for the employer to prove
s/he did not fail in his/her duty to make reasonable adjustments. The
amount of detail which the worker needs to give to reverse the
burden of proof depends on the nature of the disability – a subtle
disability requiring specialised adjustments would require more than
basic detail.97
Although the worker needs only give a broad idea of potential
adjustments, his/her case will be stronger if s/he can put forward
several specific and sensible suggestions. Specialist organisations
will have ideas and their websites can be useful. Medical experts
and the Work Coaches or Access to Work Advisers based at
Jobcentres may also help. The Access to Work Advisers can also

give information regarding what grants the employers could have
obtained to pay for adjustments.98 If the worker was off sick at the
time, it is also worth looking at the fit notes supplied by his/her GP
and any ‘Fit for Work’ documentation as these may have made
suggestions for reasonable adjustments.99

Remedies and compensation
16.65

16.66

16.67

Medical evidence could be needed on several aspects of assessing
compensation. In terms of loss of earnings, the question is when a
worker would have returned to work, and for how long, had s/he not
been discriminated against. With progressive diseases, a doctor may
need to assess for how long the worker could continue in
employment, even assuming all reasonable adjustments were made.
Where the worker has lost his/her job and cannot find a new job,
statistical or expert evidence may be necessary to prove difficulties
on the job market for people with the relevant disability. For this, it
is worth checking the websites of specialist organisations. The
worker also needs to prove what efforts s/he has in fact made to get a
new job. Where the worker is so distressed by the manner of his/her
dismissal or other unlawful treatment by the employer that it
interferes with his/her ability to get a new job, medical evidence
should be obtained as confirmation.
The worker will also need to provide evidence of his/her injury to
feelings, as in all discrimination cases. If the worker has seen his/her
GP with resulting depression, a GP report should be obtained. If the
worker has suffered psychiatric damage to his/her health, an expert
medical report is essential.100

Injury to feelings, mitigation and other evidence
16.68

Although the Vento bands for injury to feelings101 tend to focus on the
seriousness of the discriminatory actions, the real issue in assessing
the award is the level of the worker’s hurt feelings. The two tend to
go together, but not necessarily. The worker should explain how
his/her feelings were affected by what happened. Medical reports

16.69

16.70

16.71

are not essential for ordinary injury to feelings claims, but the
worker is likely to be awarded a higher sum if s/he did visit his/her
GP with distress resulting from the discrimination and a GP’s report
can be obtained. To claim compensation for more serious injury to
health, eg psychiatric damage, a formal medical report will be
essential.102 The Judicial College gives guidelines regarding
psychiatric damage in personal injury cases, which may be useful for
discrimination cases too.103 Many of the principles relevant to
obtaining medical evidence in a disability discrimination case will
also be relevant to proving injury to feelings or health where there is
discrimination because of other protected characteristics (see paras
16.56–16.62).
Sexual harassment cases usually cause severe injury to feelings,
sometimes amounting to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
General research reports and statistical evidence of the level of
sexual harassment of women at work and its effects may also be
useful. To prevent an ET taking a pregnancy dismissal case less
seriously than other forms of discrimination, a report from the
worker’s own GP plus any expert evidence that this can be a time
when women feel particularly vulnerable, would be helpful.104 See
para 21.81 regarding the possibility of the tribunal covering the costs
of a GP report.
Women who are pregnant or with young babies, as well as black
and other minority ethnic or disabled workers, may find it harder to
obtain new employment. This can be relevant to the level of
compensation in dismissal cases including unfair dismissal. As well
as detailed evidence of the particular worker’s attempts to find fresh
employment, reference to the general problems of the subject group
may be of assistance.105
The EAT has said that compensation in discrimination cases
where no upper limit applies cannot be dealt with briefly and
informally. Careful preparation will be necessary for a remedies
hearing. With disability discrimination cases, a medical expert may
well be required as to the worker’s likely future health, since this
would be relevant to an assessment of future loss of earnings.106

Employers should make a risk assessment of risks to the
health and safety of their employees.
In extreme cases, an employee subjected to severe stress at
work may be able to resign and claim constructive unfair
dismissal.
In discrimination cases under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010, a
worker can claim compensation for psychiatric injury caused
by discriminatory treatment.
A worker can bring a personal injury claim in the civil courts for
physical or psychiatric injury caused by stress at work, but it is
hard to win such cases.
In some circumstances, stress may amount to a disability and
gain the protection of disability discrimination law under the
EqA 2010 (see chapter 15).
There is evidence that Covid-19 has adversely affected
physical and, in particular, mental health.
NHS Injury Allowance may be available for NHS staff who
temporarily lose income due to an injury or health condition
caused by their NHS employment.
Workers must not be subjected to a detriment because they
refuse to work in circumstances of danger, which they
reasonably believe to be serious and imminent. This may apply
where there are dangers of catching Covid-19. This is covered
in chapter 6.

Introduction
17.1

Health and safety at work is generally beyond the scope of this book.
The following is a brief introduction to some areas which overlap
with employment law. Note that, although this chapter is within Part

17.2

17.3

17.4
17.5

III of this book, health and safety is not considered an ‘equality’ or
‘discrimination’ area within employment law.
All employers have a duty to take reasonable care for the health
and safety of their employees. This is a general common law duty as
well as a specific statutory duty under the Health and Safety at Work
Act 1974.1 Breach of this duty may enable employees to resign and
claim constructive unfair dismissal. A breach of the implied duty to
take care of an employee’s health and safety may or may not be a
‘fundamental’ breach.2 The actual or potential risk to the employee is
likely to be an important factor. It is also possible for a breach to
become more serious over time because the risk increases or
because actual harm is caused. See para 17.11 for constructive
dismissal and stress.
Alternatively, where a worker has suffered physical or psychiatric
damage, s/he may be able to claim compensation in the civil courts
in contract or tort. Such claims are known as personal injuries
claims. These claims are hard to bring because legal aid is not
usually available. Most private solicitors will not take on stress
cases in particular, unless the worker has trade union funding, legal
expenses insurance, agrees a conditional fee arrangement (‘no win,
no fee’) or pays privately.
For civil claims in the context of harassment at work, see para
13.113 onwards.
Staff employed within the NHS may be able to claim NHS Injury
Allowance if they temporarily lose income due to an injury, disease
or other health condition which is wholly or mainly attributable to
their NHS employment.3

Risk assessments
17.6

Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations
(MHSW Regs) 1999,4 an employer must ‘make a suitable and
sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of his
employees, to which they are exposed while they are at work’.5 An
employer with five or more employees must record any significant
findings in the assessment and note any groups of employees

17.7
17.8

identified as especially at risk.6 An employer must also assess the
health and safety risks of people not in his/her employment arising
out of or in connection with the conduct of the business.7
Risk assessments should include the risk of employees developing
stress-related illness as a result of their work.8
Employees also have a responsibility to tell their employer of any
situation which would represent a serious and immediate danger to
health and safety or about any shortcomings in the employer’s health
and safety arrangements.9 In support of this responsibility is the
protection against detriment or dismissal for raising such issues in
the appropriate way.10

Stress
17.9

17.10

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) defines stress as the adverse
reaction people have to excessive pressure or other types of demand
placed on them. The HSE says stress is a serious problem. In recent
years, it has commissioned research which indicates that up to five
million people in the UK feel ‘very stressed’ by their work, with
about half a million experiencing work-related stress at a level they
believe is making them ill. In 2019/20, nearly 39 million working
days were lost due to work-related ill-health, including 17.9 million
for stress, depression or anxiety.11 This was even before Covid-19
had any real impact. There can be a variety of causes of workrelated stress, eg excessive workload, dissatisfied customers,
bullying, dangerous working conditions, and traumatic nature of
work. The HSE has published Management Standards, which are a
useful measure for assessment and support. Details of the HSE
research, Management Standards and other guidelines are available
on its website.12
A worker who has suffered psychiatric damage caused by stress at
work may be able to claim compensation in contract or tort. These
claims are heard in the county court or High Court (or Scottish
equivalent).

17.11

17.12

In theory, an employee who is subjected to severe stress at work
can resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal. S/he could claim
breach of the implied terms of trust and confidence, and the
employer’s duty to provide a safe working environment. However,
such a claim may be difficult to prove.13
A worker who wins a discrimination case in the
employment tribunal (ET) may claim compensation for injury to
feelings, which includes injury to health caused by the unlawful acts
of discrimination.14

Disability discrimination
17.13

A worker who has a stress-related illness, whether or not it is
caused by his/her work, may fall within the definition of a disabled
person under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010. If so, his/her employer
must make any reasonable adjustments required, eg reducing
workload or hours or allowing a staged return to work.15

The Covid-19 pandemic
17.14

17.15

Around one in five adults experienced some form of depression in
early 2021, more than double that observed prior to the Covid-19
pandemic.16 Mental health has been adversely affected by isolation;
anxiety about contracting the virus or about friends and family;
bereavement – often without the chance to say goodbye; fears about
job security; fears about returning to work; and financial concerns.17
Physical and mental health has been affected by poor work-life
balance; home-working with heavy computer use and poor
ergonomic work stations; reduced exercise; irregular hours;
combining work with other family responsibilities. Those with preexisting mental health conditions have been particularly affected. For
some employees, there are also the effects of long Covid.18
In the 2020 NHS annual survey, 44 per cent of staff reported
feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress, up from 40 per cent
in 2019. Caring for patients during the pandemic has taken a
significant toll on health and social care staff, contributing to stress

17.16

17.17

and burn out. Common work-related stressors are anxiety about
exposure to the virus during the commute or at the workplace;
bringing the virus home to family members; changing work patterns
and loss of control over usual working routine.19
Disability discrimination law may provide some protection where
workers’ health is severely affected by the pandemic or by
contracting long Covid (see chapter 15).
Workers must not be subjected to a detriment because they refuse
to work in circumstances of danger, which they reasonably believe to
be serious and imminent. This may apply where there are dangers of
catching Covid-19. This is covered in chapter 6.

An employment tribunal can order re-employment
(reinstatement or re-engagement) but cannot force the
employer to take the employee back. It can only award more
compensation, ie an ‘additional award’, if the employer refuses
(unless it was impracticable to re-employ).
In practice, few re-employment orders are sought or made.
Unfair dismissal compensation normally comprises a basic
award and a compensatory award.
The basic award is based on age, years of service and gross
pay (subject to a £538 weekly maximum for dismissals from 6
April 2020, and £544 maximum for dismissals from 6 April
2021).
The compensatory award is subject to an overall ceiling
(£88,519 for dismissals in year starting 6 April 2020 and
£89,493 for dismissals from 6 April 2021). There is a further
cap of 52 weeks’ gross pay if lower. The compensatory award
mainly comprises loss of earnings and pension. The latter can
be valuable but complex to calculate.
The compensatory award may be reduced for contributory
fault, failure to mitigate or procedural-only unfairness. There is
a strict order in which any such deductions must be calculated.
The compensatory award may be increased or reduced by up
to 25 per cent for the employer’s or employee’s failure to
follow guidance in the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service’s (ACAS’s) Code of Practice on Disciplinary and
Grievance Procedures.
There is recoupment of certain benefits claimed by the
employee. The employer deducts these from the
compensatory award and reimburses the Department for
Work and Pensions (DWP).

Compensation for injury to feelings is not awarded for unfair
dismissal.
There is a minimum basic award and/or no ceiling on the
compensatory award in a few special areas.
Where the employer is insolvent, the state pays limited debts
to the employee.
A week’s pay for the purposes of the basic award, additional
award and statutory redundancy pay is calculated on the basis
of a furloughed employee’s normal wage and not any reduced
furlough wage.
For discrimination remedies, see chapter 19. See para 20.279
regarding tax on termination.

Introduction
18.1

18.2

An employment tribunal (ET) which finds unfair dismissal cannot
force an employer to take the employee back, although it can make an
order for reinstatement or re-engagement and award extra
compensation (an ‘additional award’) if the employer refuses to
comply. Re-employment orders are unusual. Most employees who
win unfair dismissal cases get financial compensation. This consists
of a basic award and a compensatory award.
An employee is entitled to have an ET decide whether s/he has
been unfairly dismissed, even if his/her employer offered a financial
settlement equal to the maximum possible award.1 However, there
may be a costs risk if the employee rejects a very large offer,
particularly if the employer is prepared to admit s/he has unfairly
dismissed the employee.

Reinstatement and re-engagement
Introduction
18.3

If the employee wins his/her case, the ET must explain its powers to
order reinstatement or re-engagement and ask the employee if s/he

18.4

wants re-employment.2 This duty exists even if the employee did not
indicate a desire for re-employment on his/her tribunal claim form.
An ET’s decision on compensation will not necessarily be invalid if
it failed to ask about re-employment, but it may be invalid if the
failure led to injustice.3
If the employee does now want to get his/her job back, the ET will
decide whether to order reinstatement or re-engagement or neither. If
neither of the re-employment orders is practicable or desired by the
employee, the ET will make an award of compensation.4 It was
envisaged when ETs were first introduced that re-employment orders
would be the primary remedy. Realistically, however, the parties
tend not to want to work with each other again after the conclusion of
an ET hearing, making re-employment orders rare.

What are reinstatement and re-engagement orders?
18.5

18.6

Under an order for reinstatement, the employer must treat the
employee in all respects as if s/he had not been dismissed.5 The ET
will decide the date when the employee will return to work and the
amount of the missing wages and benefit that the employer must pay
for the period between dismissal and reinstatement, including
restoring any rights that the employee would have acquired during
the period of absence. Notice pay or other ex gratia payments and
any earnings from a new employer will be deducted.6
An order for re-engagement is more flexible. The ET can decide
the employee must be engaged by the employer, its successor or an
associated employer in employment comparable to previously or in
other suitable employment.7 On making an order, the ET needs to
specify the terms on which re-engagement will take place, including
the employer’s identity, the nature of the employment and its pay, the
date when the employee will start work and the amount payable by
the employer in respect of any benefit including pay which the
employee might reasonably have expected to have had but for the
dismissal, giving credit for notice pay, ex gratia payments and new
earnings.8 The employee is entitled to put forward his/her views on
the terms of the order.9

Except where the ET takes into account any contributory fault by
the employee (see para 18.53), an order for re-engagement should be
on terms which are, so far as is reasonably practicable, no less
favourable than an order for reinstatement would have been.10 This
means that (apart from this exception) with both types of order, an
employee should get all his/her back pay between the date of
termination and the date of re-employment. Even if the dismissal is
unfair only on purely procedural grounds and there would normally
be a percentage reduction in the compensatory award on the Polkey
principles, there can be no such reduction of back pay if a reemployment order is made.11
Where re-employment has been ordered, the ET cannot reduce the
back pay for the employee’s failure to mitigate, eg failure to look for
another job.12 This contrasts with the position on the compensatory
award, where an employee does not want re-employment.13 Again,
unlike the ordinary position with a compensatory award, there is no
upper limit on the back pay which can be ordered.
ETs sometimes like to avoid making orders by pressing the parties
to agree certain steps. This can cause difficulties when one or other
side does not stick to the agreement. In the case of re-engagement, an
ET must make an order and not simply order the employer ‘to offer
to re-engage’ on specified terms.14

18.7

18.8

18.9

Will the employment tribunal order re-employment?
In exercising its discretion whether to order re-employment, an ET
must first consider reinstatement and if it decides not to order that,
then it must consider re-engagement.15 In both cases, the ET must
take into account:16

18.10

•

whether the employee wants an order and what type of order;

•

whether it is practicable for the employer to comply with an order;

•

whether it would be just to make an order if the employee has caused or contributed to
some extent to the dismissal.

18.11

18.12

18.13

At this stage, the ET only needs to make a provisional assessment of
whether it is practicable to re-employ the employee, and this should
encourage the ET to be positive.17 The ET can reconsider after it has
made an order, if the employer refuses to re-employ on grounds of
practicability.
The practicability of re-employment is assessed as at the date
when it would take effect, not at the date of dismissal, and not
necessarily even at the date of the remedies hearing.18 It is not a bar
to getting a re-employment order that the employee has meanwhile
got another job.19 The fact that the dismissal was found to be unfair
only on procedural grounds is not a reason in itself why reemployment should not be offered.20 However, the background
circumstances as to why the dismissal was not substantively unfair
may be relevant to the practicality of re-employment, eg if the
worker was dismissed for a lengthy sickness absence, which was
only unfair because the employer failed to consult. ‘Practicable’
means more than just possible. The order must be capable of being
carried into effect with success.21 It is unlikely to be practicable to
re-employ if the working relationship has completely broken down.22
An employment relationship has to work in human terms. As a
matter of common sense, it is unlikely to be practicable for an
employee to return to work for an employer who does not have
confidence in him/her, either because of the employee’s previous
conduct or because the employer feels the employee cannot do the
job to the required standard. It is not for the tribunal to decide
whether the employer is right to hold that opinion. However, the
employer cannot just assert that s/he lacks trust and confidence in the
employee. S/he must prove that his/her view is genuine and rational.
If the objection is based on a minor matter or something that
happened a long time ago, this may suggest the belief is not genuine
or not rational.23
It will also not be practicable if no suitable job is available. The
employer does not have to dismiss others to make way for the
employee.24 For re-engagement, the tribunal will look at comparable
or suitable vacancies which exist at the date of the remedies hearing.

It does not have to consider vacancies which have arisen since
dismissal but have been filled by the time of the remedies hearing.
However, in respect of reinstatement to the employee’s former job, a
tribunal should not take it into account that an employer has engaged
a permanent replacement unless it was not practicable to get the
dismissed employee’s work done otherwise, or the replacement was
engaged after a reasonable period during which the employee had not
indicated s/he wanted re-employment, and it was no longer
reasonable to cover the work other than with a permanent
replacement.25 This is a good reason for noting it on the tribunal
claim if the employee wants re-employment or, even better, writing a
letter immediately after dismissal, putting the employer on notice.

The employer refuses to comply with the order
18.14

18.15

The ET’s order for reinstatement or re-engagement will have set a
start date. If the employer refuses to comply with the order, there
will be another compensation hearing. At this hearing, the onus will
be on the employer to prove that it was not practicable to re-employ
after all.26 Obviously it will be hard for the employer to convince the
ET, when s/he was unable to prevent the ET making the order in the
first place.
If the ET is satisfied that it was not practicable to re-employ, it
will order compensation for unfair dismissal in the usual way (see
para 18.16).27 But if the ET still believes re-employment was
practicable, it will also award an ‘additional award’ of no less than
26 weeks’ and no more than 52 weeks’ pay.28 A week’s pay29 is paid
gross30 and is subject to the same weekly maximum as the basic
award.31 In this latter situation, the usual ceiling on the compensatory
award can be exceeded to the extent necessary to ensure that, added
to the additional award, the total is not less than the back pay which
would have been payable had the employer re-employed.32 This is to
ensure an employer has no financial incentive for avoiding reemployment.

Compensation

Introduction
18.16

Compensation consists of two elements: the basic award and the
compensatory award. Although it is relatively easy to make an
approximate assessment of the value of an employee’s claim for
settlement purposes (apart from any lost pension element), it is
surprisingly difficult to work out and prove the exact sums with the
precision necessary for an ET hearing. See appendix A for a
compensation checklist, sample calculation and model schedule of
loss.

The basic award and redundancy payment
Basic award
18.17

18.18

18.19

The basic award was introduced to compensate employees for the
loss of job security following dismissal. The basic award is
calculated broadly in the same way as a redundancy payment.33
The basic award is calculated by reference to the period ending
with the effective date of termination34 during which the employee
has been continuously employed. It allows for one-and-a-half weeks’
pay for each year of employment in which the employee was not
below the age of 41, one week’s pay for each year of employment
when the employee was below 41 but not below 22, and half a
week’s pay for each year of employment below the age of 22. A
maximum of 20 years’ employment will be counted. The table at
appendix E can be used to calculate a basic award or redundancy
pay.
A week’s pay is gross pay subject to a maximum figure35 which is
index-linked to the retail price index (RPI). It is increased annually.
For dismissals from 6 April 2020, the upper limit was £538. This
was increased to £544 for dismissals from 6 April 2021.36 If the
employee was paid below the national minimum wage, the basic
award must be calculated on the basis of that minimum.37 If there are
fixed working hours, a week’s pay is the amount payable by the
employer under the contract of employment. If the employee’s pay
varies with the amount of work done (‘piece rate’) the amount of a

week’s pay is calculated by reference to the average hourly rate of
pay over the last 12 weeks of employment,38 and where there are no
normal hours, a week’s pay will be the average weekly pay over the
last 12 weeks of employment. Roughly speaking, the 12 weeks are
counted back from the termination date.39 There are slightly
complicated rules to ensure that the calculation is based on the
employee’s normal wage and not any reduced rate while on
furlough.40
The basic award may be reduced if the employee:

18.20
•

behaved before the dismissal or before the notice was given in such a way that it would be
just and equitable to do so;41

•

received a redundancy payment, whether paid under statute or otherwise;42

•

received an ex gratia payment, unless it would have been paid in the future, even if the
dismissal had been fair;43 or

•

unreasonably refused an offer of reinstatement, in which case the ET will reduce the basic
award by such amount as it considers just and equitable.44

18.21

A minimum basic award45 applies in certain cases, eg dismissal due
to trade union membership or activities;46 for being a health and
safety representative or carrying out such duties; for being a trustee
of an occupational pension scheme, or an employee representative
for the purposes of collective redundancy or Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE Regs)
200647 consultation or a workforce representative under the Working
Time Regulations.48 The minimum award is reviewed annually. For
dismissals in the year starting 6 April 2020 it was £6,562 and for
dismissals in the year starting 6 April 2021 it was £6,634.49
Statutory redundancy pay

18.22

Employees often think that redundancy payments will be higher than
they are. As noted above, statutory redundancy pay is calculated in
the same way as the basic award. The payment is calculated by a
combination of age; years of service; and weekly gross pay (subject
to the weekly maximum),50 roughly speaking at the termination
date.51 The relevant date is similar to the effective date of

18.23

18.24

18.25

termination.52 It is easiest to use a table such as that reproduced at
appendix E to work out the figure by which weekly pay must be
multiplied. There is also a simple interactive ready reckoner
available on the GOV.UK website.53
The statutory calculation discriminates in favour of older
employees both directly and indirectly on age grounds, but the
government decided this was justifiable because older workers find
it much harder to obtain new employment. The Equality Act (EqA)
2010 allows employers to pay an enhanced contractual redundancy
payment, provided this applies to the whole scheme, by lifting the
ceiling on a week’s pay or multiplying the weekly amount by more
than one year for each year’s service or multiplying the total by a
certain number.54 If an employer wishes to give an enhanced
redundancy payment calculated on any other basis, s/he needs to
justify the age discrimination in the usual way.55 It may well be
justifiable for an employer to adopt a redundancy pay scheme which
discriminates directly or indirectly on age grounds if the purpose is
to reward loyalty, help older workers who are vulnerable in the job
market or to encourage turnover so as to facilitate career progression
of younger staff.56 Similarly, it may be justifiable for an employer to
take account of immediate entitlement to a pension.57 But in all cases,
an employer does need to prove with evidence that the means chosen
to achieve the legitimate aim were proportionate. There are great
dangers that stereotyped assumptions can be made, eg as to at what
age employees’ job performance deteriorates.
On making a redundancy payment, the employer must give the
employee a written statement indicating how the amount was
calculated.58 If the employer is insolvent and will not pay, the
employee can apply to the Redundancy Payments Office for payment
out of the National Insurance Fund (NIF).59 S/he can also do this if
the employer simply fails or refuses to pay and s/he has taken all
reasonable steps (other than legal proceedings) to get payment from
the employer.
Any sum received as contractual redundancy pay will be set off
against the statutory amount.

The compensatory award
The idea of the compensatory award is to compensate the employee
for the financial loss suffered as a result of being dismissed,
including expenses incurred and loss of fringe benefits.60 The point
is to compensate the employee, but not to award him/her a bonus, and
not to penalise the employer. The ET must award what it considers to
be ‘just and equitable’ having regard to the loss and it has wide
discretionary powers. The tribunal must not take into account the
employer’s financial circumstances and whether it has enough money
to pay the award.61
The compensatory award is subject to an overall ceiling which is
revised annually. For dismissals in the year starting 6 April 2020, it
was £88,519 and in the year starting 6 April 2021, it was £89,493.62
There is a further cap of 52 weeks’ gross pay, if this is lower than
the overall ceiling.63 This additional cap, introduced by the coalition
government in July 2013, substantially increases the risk that
employees who have been unfairly dismissed through no fault of their
own are not fully compensated for their financial loss. The ceilings
do not apply to dismissals for health and safety or whistleblowing
reasons64 or to compensation for unlawful discrimination.65 When
employees hear about the ceiling, they tend to expect it is the sum
they will get. This does not necessarily follow. Statistics are
available on average awards made by tribunals, but this is also a
poor guide. It is important that employees understand that the
compensatory award is worked out by reference to a number of set
factors, the most important of which is probably their loss of
earnings and pension.
The compensatory award often includes compensation under these
headings:

18.26

18.27

18.28

•

loss of earnings;

•

loss of fringe benefits;

•

loss of pension;

•

expenses for job-hunting or, rarely, the cost of setting him/herself up in business66 or
moving to find employment;67

•

loss of statutory rights.

When an ET makes an award, it must set out the heads of
compensation, so that everyone can understand how it arrived at the
total figure.68
Compensation for injury to feelings
18.29

Compensation for injury to feelings and other non-economic loss
cannot be awarded for unfair dismissal cases.69 Injury to feelings and
aggravated damages can be awarded to an employee who wins
his/her case for detriment short of dismissal on grounds related to
trade union membership or activities,70 or for other cases concerning
detriment short of dismissal,71 eg due to whistleblowing72 or for
taking up a right under the Working Time Regulations. The Vento
guidelines73 apply to the size of any injury to feelings award.74
Loss of earnings
1)

18.30

18.31

Past and future loss

Usually the largest part of an employee’s compensatory award is the
amount for loss of earnings. In theory, the ET will award loss of
earnings from the effective date of termination (EDT) until the
hearing date (‘past loss’) and thereafter until the ET decides that the
loss would have stopped or it becomes too speculative to award any
further loss (‘future loss’). If the employee has obtained a new job at
a lower rate of pay, the ET will estimate how long s/he is likely to
be earning less, and award the difference. Once a new job is secured
which is as well or better paid, the compensation calculation will
usually stop at that point, rather than the higher pay eating into the
earlier losses, but ultimately it is up to the tribunal.75
Where the employee was dismissed76 without notice or pay in
lieu, s/he will be awarded loss of earnings through the notice period.
Any earnings from a new job need not be deducted.77 Similarly, even
if s/he did get paid in lieu of notice, s/he need not set off any higher
earnings in the notice period against his/her claim for loss of
earnings after the notice period.78 This should not be confused with a

18.32

18.33

18.34

wrongful dismissal claim for unpaid notice, where earnings during
the notice period would be set off.79 Further, an employee will not be
awarded loss of earnings for unfair dismissal through the notice
period if s/he would have been off sick and only receiving statutory
sick pay (SSP) at that time.80 However, if the employee only has a
statutory notice entitlement, a way round this might be a wrongful
dismissal claim for full pay for the notice period, since special rules
apply (see para 1.39).
If the employee has not found a new job, the ET, in assessing how
long s/he is likely to remain unemployed, will take into consideration
the employee’s age81 and personal characteristics,82 and the
availability of work in the locality. Owing to the speculative nature
of this part of the award, it is important to present compelling and
persuasive evidence; this should include the opinion of the local
jobcentre or other job agencies and the efforts made to secure
employment.
Future loss of earnings will not be awarded after a date on which
an ET decides the employee would not continue to have been
employed anyway, eg if three months after his/her dismissal, the
employer closed down. Or there may come a point where an
employee would have become too ill to work. But the date of such
ill-health should not be an automatic cut-off for loss of earnings
because the tribunal needs to consider what would have happened
had s/he not been unfairly dismissed, eg how long the employment
would have continued prior to dismissal; what statutory or
contractual pay and benefits the employee would have received
meanwhile; whether s/he would have returned to work or what
his/her notice entitlement would have been.83
Employees cannot assume that the ET will award all of their past
loss of earnings, ie up to the date of the ET hearing. Employees have
a duty to ‘mitigate’ their loss,84 ie to try to find a new job and not
simply to sit back and await compensation from the tribunal. This is
a real problem in practice. It is crucial that an adviser informs
employees at the outset that this is how compensation works and that
they should look for fresh employment and keep records of all their

attempts, including copies of letters written, diary notes of
appointments, screenshots of on-line applications and responses, and
hard copies of emails (as these tend to be deleted). It would be wise
for employees to register with a local or specialist job agency, read
specialist press and apply for vacancies. The ET will be
unsympathetic to employees who did not even try to get another job,
eg due to fear of a bad reference. It is better that employees apply for
a job and if they get rejected on grounds of poor references, they
could write to their ex-employer about this, reminding the employer
that they are trying to mitigate their loss and possibly, ask for an open
reference.85
The ET will expect a degree of flexibility from employees as time
goes on if they are getting nowhere. Employees need not necessarily
accept the first job which is offered, if it is on low pay, since they
may be acting reasonably in mitigating their loss by looking for a job
with equivalent pay to previously.86 For a period of time, it is
unreasonable to expect an employee to lower his/her sights, but after
a while, it may be reasonable for him/her to accept a job of lesser
pay and status.87 There is always a risk that if an employee is offered
a job and turns it down because of low pay or other unsuitability, the
ET may decide to stop awarding compensation from the date of the
offer. If the tribunal does reduce compensation for failure to mitigate,
it should try to work out when it says the employee should have got a
new job and at what pay, rather than simply apply a broad percentage
deduction.88
When employers lose cases, they tend to fight very hard on the
issue of compensation and go to the ET armed with evidence of
suitable available vacancies. If there is a potential problem, it may
be useful to take the case of Wilding v British Telecommunications
plc89 to the ET, as a corrective to the ET being too tough on the
employee. The Court of Appeal set out these guidelines in Wilding:

18.35

18.36

•

It is the duty of an employee to act as a reasonable person who was not expecting
compensation from the former employer.

•

The onus is on the employer as the wrongdoer to show that the employee failed to
mitigate.90

•

If the employee turned down a job offer, eg from the former employer, the test is whether
the employee acted unreasonably, taking into account all the circumstances.

•

The court or tribunal must not be too stringent in its expectations of the employee, who is,
after all, the injured party.

18.37

18.38

The ET must take the employee’s age, health and other personal
circumstances into account in deciding whether s/he has failed to
mitigate.91 The ET should not refuse to award compensation for loss
of earnings because the claimant is unfit to work, if the claimant’s illhealth was caused by the dismissal.92 However, in a constructive
dismissal case, the claimant cannot get compensated in the ET – as
opposed to making a civil claim – for loss of earnings resulting from
ill-health caused by the employer’s conduct prior to dismissal.93
This unpractical outcome is because the loss of earnings would,
strictly speaking, have been caused by the employer’s actions during
the employment and not by the dismissal itself. Depending on the
situation, it may be reasonable for an employee to mitigate his/her
loss by setting up in business94 rather than immediately looking for a
job with a new employer. It may also be reasonable to undergo
retraining or study in order to change careers and improve long-term
earning capacity, but there must be good reasons to make this choice
in the particular case.95
If the employee gets a new job but has been dismissed or resigned
by the time of the ET hearing, it will depend on the facts whether the
ET will order the original employer to pay compensation for lost
earnings beyond the date when the new job started.96 If the new job
did not last long and was always unsuitable, it could be argued that
the employee finding him/herself out of a job again is all part of the
loss arising from the original dismissal. A reasonable but
unsuccessful attempt to mitigate does not break the link between the
original dismissal and the resulting loss.97 However, a longer period
of new employment, where the employee loses the job through
his/her own fault, probably would break the link.
2)

Calculating the weekly loss

The calculation is based on how much the employee would have
earned had s/he remained in the old job, including regular overtime,
bonuses and the employer’s pension contributions98. The employee
needs to produce evidence of this. The ET must take account of
likely pay rises (even if not contractual), including anticipated
overtime payments.99 The award will be greater where the increase
is certain rather than probable. If the employer can show that
overtime would have diminished or ceased, the award will be
reduced accordingly. If the employee would have been unable to
work for the original employer anyway because of sickness and
would only have been entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP), then s/he
will not be awarded loss of earnings for that period if she could get
the same level of benefits when out of work.
Unlike the basic award, the award for loss of earnings is
calculated net of tax and National Insurance (NI) contributions. If the
employee was paid below the statutory minimum wage, the
calculation of lost earnings must be based on the minimum wage.100

18.39

18.40

Loss of fringe benefits
The compensatory award includes an element for the loss of fringe
benefits in respect of both the immediate and the future loss period.
The value of these can be hard to quantify, though it is usually the
cost to the employee of replacing them. The following fringe benefits
have been taken into consideration by ETs:

18.41

•

entitlement to holiday pay;

•

tips or other gratuitous payments which would have been earned during the compensatory
period;101

•

the loss of a company car, which is usually assessed by reference to the AA guidelines on
car running costs;102

•

cheap loans (ie the value in comparison with bank loans);103

•

accommodation, if it is free or subsidised;

•

medical insurance, which is assessed by reference to the cost to the employee of acquiring
the same medical protection.

Loss of statutory rights

18.42

Loss of long notice entitlement, maternity rights and the right to claim
unfair dismissal should be reflected in the compensatory award. The
loss of unfair dismissal protection104 is now usually compensated at
or just below the level of the current maximum on a week’s
redundancy pay,105 ie currently around £500. This tends to be known
as an award for ‘loss of statutory rights’. The ET is unlikely to make
this award if the employee has already been employed in a new job
for two years by the time of the hearing. In addition, if the employee
has built up a long statutory minimum notice period, s/he can also
claim for the fact that s/he will have to start again in any new job.
This award is usually valued at half of the entitlement to the statutory
notice which had been acquired, calculated as a net sum.106 This
means no more than a six-week multiplier, ie half the maximum
statutory notice period.107 The reason for the reduction is to reflect
the double contingency that the employee will get a new job and then
that s/he will be dismissed before acquiring a similar level of notice
entitlement. It can be difficult to claim this latter award, and advisers
should take copies of the case-law with them to the ET.108 Employers
– and even tribunals – sometimes argue that the employee has
already been paid his/her notice pay and should not get a double
award. This is misconceived. The point is to compensate an
employee for being vulnerable in his/her new job – just as an
employee has already had his/her unfair dismissal claim in respect of
the old job, but still routinely gets awarded a sum for loss of
statutory rights.
Loss of pension rights

18.43

If the employee had an occupational pension with his/her employer,
the pension loss caused by the dismissal needs to be added into the
compensatory award. In limited situations, an employee may also
suffer some loss of state pension. Unfortunately pension loss is the
hardest to quantify, yet may be the most valuable part of the
employee’s claim. The burden of proof is on the employee to prove
the loss, so s/he must obtain the necessary pension documents from

18.44

18.45

18.46

18.47

18.48

the employer when preparing the case and work out how to quantify
the loss.
The latest (4th) edition of Employment tribunals: principles for
compensating pension loss is extremely helpful. This clear and
detailed guide, referred to as the ‘Principles’, was written by a
group of Employment Judges and published in August 2017.109
Presidential Guidance says that tribunals are expected to have regard
to the ‘Principles’ when calculating pension loss.110 Having said
that, the ‘Principles’ are not statutory, and if the parties put forward a
credible alternative with supporting evidence, the tribunal should
listen.111 It is beyond the scope of this book to give practical
guidance to calculating pension loss. The following is simply an
introduction to the main concepts.
If pension loss is likely to be substantial, it may be worth getting
expert advice from an actuary on the value of lost rights. An
alternative approach would be to obtain quotations for the cost of
replacing the lost pension. Calculations need to be made as to what
pension the employee is now likely to receive and what pension s/he
would have received had it not been for the dismissal. Insurance
companies can quote for topping up the pension to the latter level.
The way to calculate financial loss differs according to whether
the employee was employed on a ‘defined benefit’ scheme (eg a final
salary or career average revalued earnings (CARE) scheme) or a
‘defined contribution’ scheme (money purchase).
In a defined contribution scheme, the amount of pension is based
on the investment of sums contributed by the employee and employer
over a number of years. In a final salary scheme, the amount of
pension is based on a proportion of the employee’s earnings at the
leaving date for each year of service, eg 1/60 or 1/80 per year
worked. In recent years, final salary schemes have become far less
common. Where they still exist, the pension is now usually based on
‘pensionable pay’ (which can be less than the full salary) and ‘career
average’ pay (known as a CARE scheme) rather than final pay.
Where an employee leaves a defined contribution scheme early, eg
due to dismissal, s/he retains the value of the sums invested to the

18.49

18.50

18.51

termination date, but loses the prospective value of further
contributions from the employer. There may also be a financial
penalty for leaving early. The financial loss is therefore fairly easy to
calculate. The position is more complicated with a final salary or
other defined benefit scheme. The early leaver will usually be
entitled to a deferred pension, but one which will be of lesser value
than had s/he not been dismissed. The difference can be hard to
quantify and will depend on the approach taken by the tribunal.
The ET ‘Principles’ recommend two approaches to calculating
pension loss: ‘simple’ and ‘complex’. The ET need not follow either
approach, but it must explain its reasons for rejecting both or for
choosing one of them. The ‘simple approach’ will almost always
apply to a defined contribution scheme. This involves adding up the
amount of the employer’s pension contributions for the period of
loss. The employee’s own pension contributions are not included
because, as a result of the dismissal, the employee has not had to pay
those. There is more detail of this approach starting at para 4.17 of
the ‘Principles’ and there are sample calculations in its appendix 3.
The ‘simple’ approach to calculation will sometimes also be
appropriate for a defined benefit scheme, eg where the period of loss
is relatively short, say 6–12 months as a rule of thumb, or where the
statutory cap on the unfair dismissal award means it is not worth the
cost and effort of calculating full pension loss the ‘complex’ way. To
use the ‘simple’ approach, it will be necessary to find out the rate of
the employer’s contribution to the defined benefit scheme. The
‘Principles’ explain more about using the ‘simple’ approach for
defined benefit schemes at paras 5.30–5.40.
Many cases involving defined benefit schemes will not be suitable
for the ‘simple’ contributions-based calculation method. The
‘complex’ approach then involves using the Ogden tables and/or
expert evidence. The ‘Principles’ explain the ‘complex’ approach
for defined benefit cases at para 5.41 onwards, including ‘seven
steps’ for making calculations based on the Ogden tables.
Adjustments to the compensatory award

18.52

18.53

18.54

Payments under any private or occupational pension scheme which
the employee decides to take early as a result of the dismissal are not
set off against the compensatory award.112
If the ET finds the dismissal was to any extent caused or
contributed to by any action of the employee, it can reduce the
compensatory award proportionally as it thinks fit.113 This is known
as ‘contributory fault’ and the ET usually makes a percentage
reduction, eg 25 per cent or 50 per cent, but in very rare cases, it can
deduct 100 per cent. There are two separate questions: 1) did the
employee’s conduct cause or contribute to the dismissal? and 2) if
so, by how much would it be ‘just and equitable’ to reduce the
compensatory award? Even if the tribunal believes the employee’s
conduct was completely responsible for the dismissal, it will not
necessarily be just and equitable to reduce the compensatory award
by 100 per cent.114 The employee’s conduct must have been culpable
or blameworthy. This does not necessarily include merely
unreasonable conduct – it depends on the extent of the
unreasonableness.115 The biggest risk of a reduction for contributory
fault is where the employee has been dismissed for misconduct, but it
is also possible with dismissals in other categories if the employee
has acted in a blameworthy way, eg his/her actions have led to a
breakdown in trust and confidence.116 Potentially, actions arising
from an employee’s alcoholism could also amount to contributory
fault.117 Contributory fault for incompetence would be rare, unless
the employee was deliberately lazy or negligent.118 The
compensatory award in a constructive dismissal claim can
theoretically also be reduced for contributory fault, although it will
be unusual.119 Compensation cannot be reduced for post-dismissal
misconduct.120 It is the tribunal’s view of the claimant’s behaviour
and whether it amounts to contributory fault which counts, not the
employer’s.121
The decision to reduce the award and the degree of contribution is
discretionary and can only be challenged before the Employment
Appeal Tribunal (EAT) if it is legally perverse (ie no ET properly
directing itself could have reached the same decision). Such a

18.55

18.56

18.57

challenge is very difficult to succeed in, though the employee must
have been given the opportunity to give evidence on the matter in the
ET. The ET must also identify the conduct which has been taken into
account and explain why it is blameworthy.122
There is nothing to stop a tribunal reducing compensation both for
contributory fault and on the Polkey principle (see para 18.57).
However, a tribunal should first consider the Polkey deduction, and
this may affect how much it thinks it is just and equitable to deduct
for contributory fault.123 As well as reducing the compensatory
award for contributory fault, the ET can reduce the basic award for
conduct before the dismissal, where it would be just and equitable to
do so.124 In the case of the basic award, it is not necessary that such
conduct actually caused or contributed to the dismissal.
Nevertheless, if an employer does reduce the compensatory award
for contributory fault, it is likely that it will also reduce the basic
award by the same percentage.
If the employer or employee unreasonably fails to follow the
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) Code of
Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures,125 the
compensatory award may be increased or decreased by up to 25 per
cent respectively.126 Another type of statutory adjustment can be
made by a tribunal in whistleblowing cases. If the tribunal believes
the disclosure was not made in good faith, it may reduce the
worker’s compensation by up to 25 per cent if it thinks it just and
equitable to do so.127
So-called ‘Polkey reductions’ are more common than those for
contributory fault. A dismissal may be unfair for procedural reasons
only, even though the actual reason for dismissal is fair.128 In such
cases, the compensatory award may be reduced by a percentage to
reflect the likelihood that the employee would still have been
dismissed, even if fair procedures had been followed. A percentage
reduction can be as high as 100 per cent, although the ET might still
award loss of earnings for the time it would have taken to go through
proper procedures. Most often a reduction will be in the area of 25–
50 per cent. A tribunal should not automatically assume that just

18.58

18.59

18.60

because the dismissal was for gross misconduct, the employer would
definitely have dismissed the employee, even if fair procedures had
been followed (though it makes it more likely).129
It is often difficult to decide whether unfairness is ‘procedural’ or
a matter of substance. Either way, the tribunal must consider this
question of whether and when the employee would have been
dismissed if the employer had acted fairly. Sometimes this is
obvious, eg the employee would have left anyway in six months’
time, eg because of retirement or closure of the workplace. It is also
fairly obvious where the only unfairness in a redundancy dismissal is
the failure to consider alternative employment, but there were no
suitable available vacancies anyway. But sometimes it is less clear
what would have happened, eg if the dismissal was only unfair due
to unfair redundancy selection criteria, would the employee still
have been selected for redundancy if fair criteria had been used? A
tribunal must not refuse to make a percentage reduction just because
there is an element of speculation – a degree of uncertainty is an
inevitable feature of the exercise. On the other hand, if the evidence
is such that the whole exercise of trying to reconstruct what might
have been, is riddled with uncertainty, no deduction should be
made.130
A tribunal can only reduce compensation to reflect the fact that the
employee would have been dismissed anyway at some later point, if
such dismissal would have been a fair dismissal. It also assumes the
employer would not have generally acted unlawfully towards the
employee in any way which might impact on the continuation of
his/her employment, eg by subjecting the employee to oppressive
working conditions which would cause the employee to go off sick
and then dismissing him/her for sickness absence.131
If the employer ought to have started consultation much earlier,
when s/he first knew redundancy was likely, and as a result, the
employee loses time when s/he could have started looking for a new
job, compensation can extend to pay for that lost time.132
Order of deductions and adjustments

The order of the various deductions, and the imposition of the
overall ceiling,133 makes a big difference to the final award. There
have been several cases on what order should be followed. The ET
should approach the calculation as follows:134

18.61

•

Calculate the loss which the employee has sustained in consequence of the dismissal
insofar as the loss is attributable to action taken by the employer. For example, loss of
earnings and pension, and job-hunting expenses.

•

Deduct all sums paid by the employer as compensation for the dismissal, eg pay in lieu of
notice135 or an ex gratia payment, but exclude at this stage any redundancy pay to the
extent it exceeds the basic award. Also deduct earnings in a new job.136

•

Any Polkey reduction (para 18.57) should then be made.

•

Increase or reduce the sum by up to 25 per cent for failure to comply with a relevant part
of the ACAS Code on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures.137

•

Add two or four weeks’ pay if, when proceedings were begun, the employer was in breach
of his/her duty to give the employee a written statement of employment particulars or
change under ERA 1996 s1 or s4.138

•

Make any reduction for contributory fault.

•

Deduct any redundancy payment to the extent it exceeds the basic award.

•

If part of the award will be taxable (eg if the taxable amount is over £30,000), gross it
up.139

•

If the sum calculated in accordance with the above is in excess of the statutory ceiling, the
final stage is to reduce it to bring it down to the statutory maximum.140

Recoupment
18.62

Any income support, jobseeker’s allowance (JSA), income-related
employment and support allowance (ESA) or universal credit
received by the employee should not be set off against the sum
awarded by the ET. However, the effect is the same from the
employee’s point of view, because the employer must repay the sum
to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) before passing on
the balance of the award to the employee.141 This is known as
recoupment. The ET will ask the employee whether s/he has
received these benefits and, if so, its judgment will set out two

figures: the monetary award (ie the total compensation awarded) and
the prescribed element.
The prescribed element is the amount awarded for loss of earnings
between the dismissal date and the final ET hearing, subject to any
reductions made, eg for contributory fault. It will also be reduced
proportionately if the statutory cap had to be applied to the overall
award.142 The judgment will specify the amount of the prescribed
element and the period to which it relates. The ET must send a copy
of the judgment with these details in a recoupment notice to the DWP
when sending the judgment to the parties.
On receiving the judgment, the employer can immediately pay the
balance of the monetary award to the employee. S/he must not pay
the prescribed element until s/he has received a recoupment notice
from the local DWP or notification that no recoupment applies. The
notice should be served on the employer within 21 days of any
reserved judgment or the conclusion of the hearing or nine days of an
oral judgment, whichever is later.143 The employer then pays the
recouped amount back to the DWP and the balance of the prescribed
element to the employee. The employee gets a copy of the notice and
should notify the local office in writing if s/he disagrees with the
amount of benefit stated as paid. It almost always takes the DWP
much longer to serve the recoupment notice and it may be necessary
to write to the relevant office, reminding it of the timescale in the
regulations. If the delay continues, the employee could use the
DWP’s complaints procedure.
Because of recoupment, if the employee was receiving a large
amount of income support, income-based JSA, ESA or universal
credit, his/her claim could be worth very little. In particular, where
the employee has claimed mortgage interest as part of his/her income
support or income-based JSA, recoupment may swallow most of the
award. If the case is settled before the hearing, the recoupment
provisions do not apply. It is in the interests of both parties to settle
and to reach an agreement on compensation, bearing in mind that
there will no recoupment on the settlement sum. The parties often
agree to split the difference on the amount which would have been

recouped. It is safer if the settlement is for a single figure and does
not itemise the specific claims that are being settled, such as notice
pay, holiday pay, wages, etc just in case the recoupment provisions
could be applied as a result, although this is unlikely. Housing
benefit paid following the dismissal is not deducted.144

Interest
Interest is payable on ET awards and runs from the day after the
decision unless the award was paid in full within 14 days.145 Where
there is an appeal whose outcome does not affect the level of
compensation, the interest still accrues from that date. Where the
appeal alters the award of compensation, interest runs on the altered
award but still from the original decision (or, for claims presented
before 29 July 2013, from 42 days afterwards). Unfortunately, if an
ET has only made a decision on liability, which is appealed by the
employer, no interest can run until a decision on compensation is
made, usually not until the appeal has been disposed of.
Interest runs on a daily basis on unpaid parts of the award and the
rate is that applicable from time to time under the Judgments Act
1838 s17. The ET decision will stipulate the applicable interest rate
(eight per cent at the time of writing).

18.66

18.67

Interim relief
The law gives special protection in respect of certain dismissals,
especially where these relate to whistleblowing or to acting as a
workplace representative of various kinds. As well as a minimum
basic award and no ceiling on the compensatory award (in some
cases)146 there are also provisions for interim relief.
Where an employee is dismissed (though not selected for
redundancy) for certain reasons, s/he can claim interim relief.147 The
reasons include dismissal for:

18.68

18.69

•

whistleblowing;

•

trade union membership or activities;

•

taking on the role and activities of a health and safety representative;

18.70

18.71

•

being a trustee of an occupational pension scheme;

•

being an employee representative for collective consultation on redundancies or TUPE;

•

being a workforce representative under the Working Time Regulations.

Interim relief is not available for ordinary unfair dismissal or
discrimination claims.148
Interim relief hearings happen very fast. The employee must apply
for interim relief together with his/her tribunal claim for unfair
dismissal by the end of seven days following the effective date of
termination.149 The ACAS early conciliation (EC) procedure need
not be followed.150 If the dismissal is for trade union membership or
activities, s/he must also produce a certificate from an authorised
union official.151 The ET must then decide the issue as soon as
possible, giving the employer at least seven days’ notice of the
hearing.
If the ET decides it is likely that the employee will succeed in
his/her unfair dismissal case at the eventual hearing, it can order
interim relief, ie reinstatement or re-engagement (if the employer
agrees) or otherwise a continuation of contract order (CCO).152
‘Likely to succeed’ means having a pretty good chance of success.153
A CCO orders the employer to pay the employee’s wages and other
benefits from dismissal until the eventual ET decision or settlement.
The payments are not repayable, even if the employee ultimately
loses.

Enforcement
18.72

If an employer does not pay an ET award or compensation under a
settlement or compromise agreement, it is possible to enforce
payment directly in the county court or High Court (England and
Wales) or sheriff court (Scotland).154 This removes the need to
register the judgment and pay a fee first. There is guidance on the
different systems in England and Wales and in Scotland on the
GOV.UK site.155 Settlements and compromise agreements are
enforced by bringing a claim in the county court or High Court, as
appropriate, usually for damages for breach of contract. This has

also been simplified in respect of non-payment of ACAS settlements
(with some exceptions).156 Following research showing a high level
of unpaid tribunal awards, High Court Enforcement Officers were
given power to recover tribunal awards and settlements.157 An
unpaid claimant can also ask the Department for Business, Energy &
Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to impose a penalty for non-payment and
publicly name the employer. Details of the schemes and how to apply
are on the GOV.UK website.158 Although the penalty goes to the
government and not the claimant, the threat of a fine and public
naming may persuade some reluctant employers to pay.

Employer insolvency and debts covered by the
state
18.73

If the employer becomes insolvent, certain debts can be claimed
from the state. These include unpaid wages up to eight weeks; up to
six weeks’ holiday pay in the previous 12 months; and statutory
notice pay.159 All these are subject to a weekly limit, which was
£544 where the employer became insolvent on or after 6 April 2021
or, in the case of notice pay, when the employment terminated if
later.160 Statutory redundancy pay and any ET basic award (though
not the compensatory award) can also be recovered.161 An
application needs to be made to the Insolvency Service162 or, in
some cases, the employer’s representative. Generally speaking, the
Insolvency Service will only pay if the employer is insolvent and not
just because s/he has stopped trading. However, redundancy pay is
also reimbursed where the employer simply refuses to pay and the
employee has taken all reasonable steps to recover the payment from
the employer.163 For more details, see the GOV.UK website.164 To
check whether the employer is an insolvent company, a search can be
done on the Companies House WebCheck site.165 If the company is in
administration or receivership, the employee ought to have been
informed of the position by the administrators/receivers. See para
10.50 for the position regarding the transfer of an insolvent business.

Financial penalties
18.74

18.75

ETs can impose a financial penalty on an employer where the worker
has won any of his/her claims and the tribunal feels that the
employer’s breach of the worker’s rights had some ‘aggravating
features’.166 No examples are given in the legislation, but
presumably this envisages situations such as where a worker wins a
claim for outstanding wages against an employer who constantly fails
to pay what is due. In ‘Employment Tribunals’ Powers: Tribunal user
guidance on use and application’,167 BEIS suggests deliberate
breaches of the law or being motivated by malice would be
aggravating features and that employers with dedicated human
resources (HR) departments are more likely to be at risk. The
penalty must be 50 per cent of any award made to the worker subject
to a minimum of £100 and maximum of £20,000. This was increased
from £5000 on 6 April 2019. The tribunal must consider the
employer’s ability to pay and may choose not to make an award at
all.
According to the government, the idea of introducing financial
penalties was to incentivise employers not to behave badly. When
negotiating with employers who refuse to pay wages which are
obviously due, it may be worth reminding them that they may find
themselves facing a fine as well as the money owed if they persist in
dragging their heels.

•

When a worker wins a discrimination case, the employment
tribunal can make recommendations and award compensation.
Compensation consists of financial loss, injury to feelings and
interest. Exemplary damages can be awarded only in
exceptional circumstances.
Injury to feelings can comprise separate awards for hurt
feelings, aggravated damages and injury to health.
Injury to health compensation is compensation for personal
injury and the principles for its calculation are similar to those
for personal injury claims (for physical or psychiatric injury) in
the civil courts.
There are special considerations related to the duty to mitigate
when awarding loss of earnings in pregnancy dismissal cases.
In some cases, there may be an adjustment of compensation
because of a breach of the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) Code of Guidance on Disciplinary
and Grievance Procedures.

Introduction
When an employment tribunal (ET) has made a finding of unlawful
discrimination, it may make:1

19.1

•

a declaration of the rights of the parties in respect of the matter to which the complaint
related;

•

an appropriate recommendation;

•

an order for compensation.

Where an ET finds unintentional indirect discrimination, before
ordering compensation, it must first consider whether to make any
recommendations.2 This must not be taken as an obstacle to awarding
proper compensation for unintentional indirect discrimination.3 The
purpose of the rule is therefore puzzling, but it may be a legacy of
wording in pre Equality Act discrimination legislation. There are
different remedies in equal pay cases and in respect of
discrimination in occupational pension schemes.4

Recommendations
19.2

The ET may recommend that, within a specified period of time, the
employer take action to obviate or reduce the adverse effect on the
claimant of any matter to which the claim related.5 The Equality Act
(EqA) 2010 expanded recommendations so they could also apply to
reduce the adverse effect of discrimination ‘on anyone else’, but the
power to make these ‘wider recommendations’ was abolished for
cases started on/after 1 October 2015.6 If, without reasonable
excuse, the employer fails to comply with the recommendation
insofar as it relates to the claimant, the ET can award compensation
or additional compensation.7 The ET cannot insist on a
recommendation being carried out. Nor can an ET recommend a pay
rise, as this should be covered by an award of compensation.
Recommendations cannot be made in respect of equal pay claims.8

Examples of recommendations are: that the employer makes a full
written apology to the claimant; that s/he provides a reference in
agreed terms; that s/he removes discriminatory documents, warnings,
adverse reports, etc from the claimant’s personnel file; or that s/he
notes on it that the claimant has been discriminated against
previously.
An interesting example of a recommendation approved by the
Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) was that an employer interview
separately a number of individuals implicated by the ET’s decision
and discuss with them those parts of the decision that affected them
as individuals.9 In another case, the ET ordered that a letter clearing
the name of the claimant (a teacher) be sent to the parents of all the
school children.10 Nevertheless, in such situations, it would usually
be better if the letter was targeted simply at the parents who knew the
teacher or knew s/he had been criticised. It is important that
recommendations, particularly those concerning equal opportunities
steps to be taken by the employer, are very precisely described. The
following are recommendations made by tribunals in real cases:11

19.3

•

The employer to arrange disability awareness training for all managers.

•

The employer to train all staff on equal opportunities and to consider appointing a diversity
champion. Progress on these issues to be reported to the claimant within three months of
the judgment.

•

In a disability discrimination case where the ET found it would have been a reasonable
adjustment to discount disability-related absences for the purpose of an attendance policy:
i)

the employer to review and implement policies on capability, absence management
and equal opportunities;

ii)

the claimant’s disability-related absences in future to be recorded separately from
other absences and not counted as part of the attendance policy;

iii)

no previous disability-related absences to be counted in with future non-disabilityrelated absences under the attendance policy;

iv)

the claimant’s disciplinary record to be expunged;

v)

serious and sympathetic consideration to be given to the claimant’s requests for unpaid
leave for rest and rehabilitation on the claimant giving as much notice as possible and
in accordance with occupational health advice.

19.4

19.5

The ET is hampered in what it can recommend. In the case Noone v
North West Thames Regional Health Authority (No 2),12 the ET
recommended that if another post of consultant microbiologist
became available, the health authority should seek the secretary of
state’s permission to dispense with the normal NHS advertising
requirements and offer the post to Dr Noone. The Court of Appeal
rescinded the recommendation because it undermined fair
recruitment procedures to the detriment of the NHS, the professions
concerned with it, the public and would-be applicants for the post.
Two other recommendations proposed by the health authority were
substituted. These were that the health authority draw to the attention
of any future appointments committee considering an application by
Dr Noone the provisions of the then Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976
and remind them that Dr Noone’s previous application had failed on
the ground of race. In Noone, the Court of Appeal was influenced by
the fact that there was a statutory obligation to advertise vacancies
within the NHS. However, in a later case against British Gas, the
EAT relying on Noone objected to a recommendation that the
claimant was promoted to the next suitable vacancy.13 Both cases
were decided a long time ago and arguably are incorrect, as they fail
to take full account of the obligation under EU law to give a full
remedy for discrimination. The suggestion that it would be
impermissible positive discrimination to slot the claimants into the
next suitable available post misses the point, which is that doing so
would be a remedy for the previous discrimination which has been
found.14 There is an extra argument in disability discrimination cases
that direct discrimination in favour of a disabled person against a
non-disabled person is permitted (see para 15.77). An ET is also
hampered in other ways. It cannot recommend that a manager write a
letter of apology making statements with which s/he does not agree,
eg saying that the criticisms s/he had previously made of the claimant
were unfounded and that the claimant had always been capable and
hard-working.15 It does not matter that the ET disagreed with this
assessment.

19.6

19.7

Now that the power to make wider recommendations has been
removed, the question is what kind of actions might obviate or
reduce the adverse effect of the discrimination on the claimant as
opposed to only benefiting other employees. It is usually accepted
that improving equality policies and introducing training is of benefit
also to the claimant as long as s/he is still employed. The training
need not be confined to those with direct contact with the claimant
since everyone working in a substantial organisation needs to
understand the effect of diversity, and training is most effective when
started from the top down.16 The main doubts concern what
recommendations can be made if the claimant has left the
employment. It may be possible in some cases to argue that the
introduction of anti-discrimination training and other good equal
opportunities policies will still alleviate the effect of the
discrimination on the claimant because s/he will take some
consolation from knowing that something has been done. This would
require specific and convincing evidence from the claimant.
Since wider recommendations cannot now be made, there may be
other ways of encouraging employers to improve their practices, eg
through the intervention of the Equality and Human Rights
Commission (EHRC) or as part of a public authority’s public sector
equality duty (PSED).17 Sometimes negotiated settlements can
include action which an employer agrees to undertake. Not only will
this not be subject to some of the above limitations, but it will also
be enforceable.

The award of compensation
Overview
19.8

Unlike for unfair dismissal, there is no upper limit on the
compensatory award. An award of compensation should comprise
all loss18 directly caused by the act of discrimination including past
and future loss of earnings, loss of opportunity and injury to
feelings.19 The overriding principle laid down by the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is that compensation must

19.9

19.10

enable the loss and damage actually sustained as a result of the
discrimination to be made good in full in accordance with the
applicable national laws.20
Loss of earnings may be claimed where appropriate, eg the
discriminatory action is dismissal or refusal to promote to a higher
paid post. Where a candidate is not short-listed for interview, an ET
may award compensation representing loss of opportunity, so that the
potential loss of earnings will be reduced by a percentage
representing the likelihood of the candidate actually obtaining the job
had s/he not been discriminated against. In dismissal cases, the
tribunal can take account of any evidence that it may take the
claimant longer to get another job than otherwise because of the
stigma associated with having brought a discrimination claim in the
minds of potential new employers.21 As with unfair dismissal cases,
a tribunal can reduce compensation for a discriminatory dismissal to
reflect the chance that the claimant would have been dismissed even
if s/he had not been discriminated against. For example, an employer
discriminates by assessing a worker badly against redundancy
selection criteria, but even if the worker had been scored fairly and
without discrimination, s/he would still have scored less than
others.22 However, this type of reduction in compensation would be
unusual in other types of discrimination case, because it is not
normally possible to say what would have happened to a worker had
s/he not been discriminated against. It is very unlikely that a
deduction would be made for contributory fault in a discrimination
case.23
Discrimination cases sometimes attract awards for lengthy future
loss of earnings, either because the discrimination has caused
psychological damage or because workers covered by the legislation
tend to be those who, for various reasons, will find it harder to find a
new job. Expert evidence will usually be necessary to prove such
lengthy loss is likely. It is only in exceptional cases that a tribunal
will calculate loss of earnings up to retirement, eg where there is
strong evidence that the worker’s career prospects are permanently
damaged and s/he will never get such a good job again. Usually an

19.11

employment tribunal should award loss of earnings only up to the
point when there is a more than 50 per cent chance that the worker
will find a new job at the same earnings as previously.24
Unfortunately, where it is appropriate to award lengthy future loss,
complexities have crept into the calculation of lengthy future loss
from personal injury cases. Employers argue there should be a
discount for the value of receiving a large capital sum up front
(‘accelerated receipt’).25 Conversely, an ET can award a premium of
approximately 2.5 per cent for delayed payments. This is particularly
appropriate in a case where some items have been discounted for
accelerated payments. It is not the same as an award for interest
(potentially at a much higher rate).26 Also, in rare cases, calculations
may be made by reference to the ‘Ogden tables’ to represent the risk
of mortality. General guidance can be found in Facts and Figures
2021/22 (updated annually).27 The Ogden tables should not be used
unless a career-long loss of earnings has been established.28 Even
then, they should only be used as a starting point and the tribunal also
needs to take into account other contingencies which are not in the
tables,29 eg whether at some stage the worker would have stopped
working for the original employer for other reasons, and what would
have happened then. This must all depend on the evidence. It is
irrelevant if the worker would have left but only for a higher paid
job.30 The tribunal also needs to bear in mind that if the claimant had
left the job at some time in the future in quite different circumstances,
this may not have led to the problems in securing alternative
employment that s/he has encountered because of the discrimination
on this occasion.31 If the Ogden tables are used, the party wanting to
use them should submit a schedule well in advance, say 14 days after
the employer’s tribunal response (ET3), and the other party should
submit a counter schedule within 14 days afterwards.32
Where there are findings of discrimination against more than one
respondent for the same discrimination – eg against the employing
organisation and the individual discriminator – the ET should usually
make a single award of compensation on a ‘joint and several’ basis,
ie so that the full award can be claimed by the claimant from either

19.12

respondent.33 This is particularly important if one or other
respondent is or becomes insolvent. The old practice of making
separate awards against individual respondents is no longer
considered lawful. If the respondents want to work out between
themselves how to share out the award, the one who pays out to the
claimant can go to court to recover a contribution from the other.
However, this is not the claimant’s problem. A manager can be
personally liable, not only for his/her own discriminatory actions,
but for those of other staff if s/he has consciously encouraged a
discriminatory atmosphere.34
Unlike with unfair dismissal awards, there is no government
recoupment in respect of benefits on discrimination awards. Certain
statutory benefits can be deducted from the award made, but not
housing benefit.35 Large ET awards in connection with termination of
employment will usually be taxable where they exceed £30,000.36 If
the award comprises past and future loss of earnings, which have
been calculated net of tax by the ET, the worker is in effect taxed
twice on the same sum. To compensate the worker properly, the ET
should award a grossed up figure. An award for injury to feelings in
connection with termination is now taxable except for psychiatric
injury.37 By contrast, awards for injury to feelings during
employment are usually not taxable.38 Tax can be complicated on
high discrimination awards, and is not within the scope of this book.

Injury to feelings and aggravated damages
Introduction
19.13

Unlike in ordinary unfair dismissal cases, an ET may make an award
for injury to feelings where it finds unlawful discrimination. Injury to
feelings are awarded to reflect the degree of hurt felt by the
particular claimant as a result of the discrimination. This can include
upset, frustration, worry, anxiety, mental distress, fear, grief, anguish,
humiliation, unhappiness, stress, depression, affront, bitterness,
shock and so on.39 It can also cover loss of a chosen career which
gave job satisfaction.40 It is not necessary that the claimant realised

19.14

at the time that the discriminatory action which upset him/her, eg the
failed promotion or dismissal, was due to discrimination.41
However, it is probable that a worker’s feelings will be even more
hurt if s/he did realise this. Injury to feelings need to be proved,
although usually this is not difficult.
There is sometimes extra compensation for ‘aggravated damages’,
ie where a worker’s sense of injury is ‘justifiably heightened by the
manner in which or motive for which’ the employer did the wrongful
act.42 In Alexander,43 the Court of Appeal said:
… compensatory damages may and in some cases should include an element of
aggravated damages where, for example, the defendant may have behaved in a highhanded, malicious, insulting or oppressive manner in committing the act of discrimination.

19.15

In practice, ETs have awarded compensation for aggravated damages
in a range of circumstances (see below).
Historically, in England and Wales, aggravated damages have not
been aggregated with and treated as part of the damages for injury to
feelings.44 More recently, the EAT has said it does not matter
whether they are put under the heading of ‘injury to feelings’ as long
as they are separately considered and identified.45 Either way, it is
sensible to list them separately in the claimant’s schedule of loss.46
In Scotland, aggravated damages cannot be awarded as a separate
head of damages, but the injury to feelings award can include an
element in recognition of this aspect.47 In very limited circumstances,
an ET can award ‘exemplary damages’, ie an award which is purely
to punish the employer.48
The size of the injury to feelings award

19.16

The size of the award is largely in the ET’s discretion. After many
years of uncertainty, the Court of Appeal laid down guidelines in the
important case of Vento v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police
(No 2).49 The Court of Appeal identified three broad bands for injury
to feelings, as distinct from compensation for injury to health:50

•

A top band, normally between £15,000 and £25,000, for the most serious cases, eg a
lengthy campaign of harassment. Only in the most exceptional case should an award for
injury to feelings exceed £25,000.

•

A middle band between £5,000 and £15,000 for serious cases which do not merit the top
band.

•

A lower band of £500–£5,000 for less serious cases, eg where the act of discrimination is
an isolated or one-off occurrence. Awards of less than £500 should generally be avoided
altogether.

19.17

19.18

Tribunals should take into account inflation since these guidelines
were set in 2003. In addition, in England and Wates, damages for
injury to feelings (including any aggravated damages) should be
increased by ten per cent under Simmons v Castle unless the case
was funded by a conditional fee arrangement (‘no win, no fee’)
entered before that date.51 There is now annual Presidential
Guidance which adjusts the Vento bands to allow for inflation and
Simmons v Castle.52 For claims issued on or after 6 April 2021:
£900–£9,100 is the recommended lower band; £9,100–£27,400 is
the middle band; and £27,400–£45,600 is the upper band. The most
exceptional cases can exceed £ 45,600. These rates are inclusive of
the Simmons v Castle ten per cent. They will be uprated if necessary
every April. The Presidential Guidance sets out a formula for
inflation for claims presented prior to 11 September 2017. In
Scotland, if an ET decides that Simmons v Castle does not apply, it
should reduce the bands accordingly, but it must explain why it
believes that to be the case. Regarding the description of the Vento
bands, these should not be rigidly applied as the real issue is the
level of hurt feelings suffered by the worker. For example, a one-off
occurrence could have sufficiently serious effects for the middle or
upper band to apply.53 As previously stated, the bands relate only to
injury to feelings, and any award for aggravated damages and injury
to health would be separate and additional.
ETs still have an enormous amount of discretion in how much they
award, and the EAT will rarely interfere if the correct band is
chosen.54 It is, therefore, very hard for advisers to predict the size of
an award as, for example, one ET may legitimately award £10,000

19.19

19.20

on a middle band case, where another might award almost double
that on the same set of facts.
One of the first cases to go to the EAT was (1) Armitage (2)
Marsden (3) HM Prison Service v Johnson.55 The case merely
illustrates when an ET is entitled (if it chooses) to make a high
award. Mr Johnson, a black prison auxiliary, was awarded £20,000
for injury to feelings for a campaign of racial harassment lasting 18
months, plus £7,500 aggravated damages for the employer’s
rejection of his grievance and putting it down to a character defect.
The employer’s investigation, instead of providing a remedy for the
wrongs suffered by the worker, added to his injury. Further, £500
was also awarded against two prison officers personally (which
now should not happen – see para 19.11). The EAT decided the ET
was entitled to award £28,500 (even if it was then a little on the high
side) for such a serious (although not the worst possible) case of
discrimination. Adjusted for inflation and Simmons v Castle,
arguably this award would now equate to around £40,000. The EAT
said that, in general, injury to feelings awards should bear some
broad similarity to the range of awards in personal injury cases. It
should also relate to the value of the sum, in terms of purchasing
power or earnings, in real life.
The EAT in Tchoula,56 a case decided before Vento, also provides
an interesting overview. The EAT reviewed a large number of the ET
awards to date and divided them into higher and lower categories.
The interesting thing about Tchoula is that although the EAT reduced
the worker’s award for injury to feelings and aggravated damages
from £27,000 to £10,000, it awarded as much as £10,000 for what it
considered to be a lower category case. Although Mr Tchoula did
suffer considerable injury to feelings, the discrimination had not
contributed to his marriage breakdown nor caused depression. The
discrimination lasted only over a period of days, and although he had
lost his job and the opportunity to continue in the security industry, he
wanted to better himself anyway. £10,000 would have been in the
middle of the original Vento band, so arguably equating to £17,500
nowadays.

19.21

19.22

19.23

19.24

The EAT refused to overturn another large ET award of £20,000
for injury to feelings and £5,000 aggravated damages (1997 figures)
in Chan v Hackney LBC.57 Mr Chan was forced into medical
retirement after months of sustained pressure. The EAT said it was
legitimate to take into account the treatment of Mr Chan outside the
time limit as context for the impact on his feelings of the acts of race
discrimination within the time limit. In 2019, the EAT refused to
overturn a total award of £21,000 (injury to feelings plus aggravated
damages) for an employee dismissed in the early stages of her career
in a job which she plainly considered her vocation, where both the
fact and manner of her dismissal caused significant distress.58
Factors which lead to high awards tend to be a long period or
numerous incidents of discrimination; false accusations made in
public; loss of a valued job or career; a particular vulnerability of
the worker, eg due to age or work environment; and most importantly,
evidence of severe injury to health and feelings or family difficulties.
Harassment of a pregnant woman could lead to a high award where it
causes additional stress because it threatens the well-being of the
unborn child.59 One-off acts of discrimination or only short periods
of harassment will not necessarily fall into the lowest Vento band as
the overall seriousness should be taken into account.60
Aggravating factors may be conscious victimisation,61 ignoring or
mishandling a grievance or appeal, a character attack on the worker,
lying about the true reason for dismissal, and failing to apologise.62 It
could also, depending on the facts, lead to aggravated damages to
promote the discriminator while the worker’s harassment grievance
has not yet been fully investigated.63 The employer’s behaviour in the
ET proceedings will also be relevant,64 including repeated
unmerited threats of costs in the correspondence. If an employer
unreasonably disputes that a disabled worker is disabled under the
EqA 2010, thus requiring him/her to go through unnecessary medical
examinations, this could lead to an award of aggravated damages.
It is advisable not to take it for granted that the ET will appreciate
the likely impact of the discrimination on the worker’s feelings, but

19.25

19.26

to give explicit evidence on this from the worker and other witnesses
including medical evidence where appropriate.
Unfortunately ET practice in the size of injury to feelings awards
is extremely variable and difficult to predict. Some ETs clearly
believe they are awarding a large sum when they award, say,
£10,000 for serious injury. It is therefore important to draw the ET’s
attention to the higher awards, especially in comparable cases, and
to the bands in Vento. Awards made by other ETs, unless appealed,
have no precedent value when considered in isolation. But it is not at
all helpful to look at reports of average awards, as these tend to keep
the figures low and ignore the factors in the particular case.65 Media
reports are highly misleading as they often report settlements rather
than ET awards and, in any event, tend to include figures for the
entire compensatory award, which may consist primarily of loss of
earnings.
Although it is hard to appeal against an award for injury to
feelings on the grounds that it is too low, where there is strong
evidence of injury and an extremely low award, this should be
considered. Where there have been a number of acts of
discrimination, particularly if there is victimisation as well as direct
discrimination or if there is discrimination based on different
characteristics (eg race and disability), the tribunal should separately
consider the injury to feelings arising from each action rather than
taking a loose overview.66 Having considered these elements
separately, a tribunal must still stand back and look at the global
figure, ensuring there is no double counting and that the overall
award is not disproportionate.

Injury to health (personal injury)
19.27

Injury to feelings, when it becomes sufficiently severe, can be
considered as an injury to health. It is now common in serious cases
to argue for injury to health as a separate category. It does not matter
exactly where the line is drawn, and ‘stress and depression’ can be
included in injury to feelings, but the ET will not allow ‘double
recovery’, ie the worker to be compensated twice for the same

19.28

19.29

19.30

injury.67 In setting its bands of compensation for injury to feelings,
Vento68 did indicate that injury to health was a separate matter.
Unfortunately, seeking compensation for injury to health in an ET
is not a simple matter, because traditionally, claims for damage to
health are brought as negligence or contract claims in the civil
courts.69 An ET can award compensation for any personal injury
caused by the discrimination.70 This means that if the discrimination
has seriously damaged the worker’s health, physically or
psychiatrically (and not solely his/her feelings), a claim for damages
for personal injury (ie injury to health) must be added to any
discrimination case which is brought. Examples could include
nervous breakdown, severe depression or post-traumatic stress
syndrome. If a worker omits to add such a claim, but his/her
discrimination case is decided by the ET or settled, s/he will very
probably be unable to make any future personal injury claim arising
from the discriminatory actions by the employer.71 This is because
the issue could and should have been argued in front of the ET – an
employer is entitled to know that all claims have been dealt with in
one place, so there is some finality to the issues.
Employment lawyers have had to become familiar with the basic
principles of quantifying damages in personal injury cases,
especially those related to psychiatric illness. A formal medical
report is strongly advisable for making such a claim. Although an
expert report may not be essential if there is other evidence as to
injury (eg occupational health (OH) reports and witness evidence),
the award is likely to be lower.72 In personal injury cases, there is a
vast body of reported awards for pain and suffering caused by
different injuries. These are collated and set out in such sources as
Kemp & Kemp: Quantum of damages73 and formulated into
guidelines by the Judicial College: Guidelines for the assessment of
general damages in personal injury cases.74
The Judicial College guidelines are often referred to in the ET
when assessing injury to health in discrimination cases. Chapter 4 of
the 2019 guidelines (15th edn) deals with psychiatric and

psychological damage and lists the following factors to be taken into
account:
•

the claimant’s ability to cope with life, education and work;

•

the effect on the claimant’s relationships with family, friends and those with whom s/he
comes into contact;

•

the extent to which treatment would be successful;

•

future vulnerability;

•

prognosis;

•

whether medical help has been sought;

•

where the injury results from sexual and/or physical abuse, there is usually a significant
aspect of psychiatric or psychological damage, but this is only part of the injury for which
damages should be awarded. Also relevant is whether there has been an abuse of trust.
Another distinguishing feature is that there may have been a long period during which the
effects of the abuse were undiagnosed, untreated, unrecognised or even denied.
Aggravated damages may be appropriate.

19.31

19.32

The guidelines put awards into four categories, with estimates of the
current value of awards in each category, ie: severe (£51,460–
£108,620); moderately severe (£17,900–£51,460); moderate
(£5,500–£17,900); and less severe (£1,440–£5,500). Cases of workrelated stress resulting in a permanent or long-standing disability
preventing a return to comparable employment are likely to be
moderately severe. Where there is marked improvement by the
hearing and a good prognosis, the case is likely to be moderate.
These categories are useful, but they are not meant to be rigid – the
facts may not fit exactly into one or other category.75 There are also
specific categories for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When
arguing for a certain sum in the ET, it may be useful to find some
cases in Kemp & Kemp within the relevant range, which are similar
to the claimant’s case. As with awards for injury to feelings,
compensation for personal injury should be increased by ten per cent
to reflect the decision in Simmons v Castle.76 The above figures are
given here with the ten per cent uplift as calculated in the guidelines.
There are well-established principles in personal injury law
regarding what should happen in cases where the claimant has a

vulnerable personality or a pre-existing condition caused by other
factors.77 This is rather complex, but can be broadly summarised as
follows:
•

The eggshell skull or personality principle: If the injury to the claimant is greater than
normal because s/he has a vulnerable personality, the employer is nevertheless responsible
for all the injury caused, even though it was unforeseeable.

•

The aggravation or exacerbation principle: If the claimant already had some symptoms
arising from a pre-existing illness, the employer is only liable for the additional injury s/he
has caused.

•

Pre-existing risk of injury: If the claimant had a pre-existing condition which made it
likely s/he would have gone on to suffer a similar psychiatric illness even if the unlawful act
had not occurred, his/her compensation will be reduced by a percentage to reflect that
possibility.

•

The acceleration principle: If the claimant had a pre-existing condition, but the symptoms
occurred sooner due to the unlawful act, the employer is only liable for losses during the
‘acceleration period’.

19.33

In all these situations, it is important to provide evidence as to what
the claimant’s condition and prognosis would have been, had s/he not
been discriminated against. When considering an award for loss of
earnings, a tribunal may make a percentage deduction to reflect the
likelihood that the worker would shortly have become unable to
work in any event, eg because s/he has a history of regular episodes
of depression. If a worker’s injury to feelings or health is caused
partly by actions which the ET has found to be unlawful
discrimination, partly by actions which the ET has found are not
unlawful discrimination and partly by other factors altogether,
compensation for the injury will only be in respect of the actions
found to be unlawful discrimination. However, this applies only if
the injury is ‘divisible’, ie if it is possible to ascertain which part of
the injury to feelings is caused by the unlawful discrimination. In
practice, it can be very difficult to differentiate between feelings
caused by a number of events occurring close together in time which
have all profoundly distressed the worker. If the injury is not
‘divisible’, the discriminator whose act has been a proximate cause

19.34

19.35

of the injury must compensate for all of it.78 It is therefore possible
for there to be different levels of deduction (if any) on loss of
earnings and on compensation for injury to feelings and health. For
example, in Sadler v Portsmouth Publishing and Printing Ltd,79 the
claimant had a significant history of depressive episodes prior to her
illness caused by sexual harassment. Based on medical evidence, the
ET found the claimant had a 33 per cent chance of becoming ill
anyway due to her pre-existing condition. Further, her current illness
was caused 80 per cent by her underlying condition and made worse
by the sexual harassment by 20 per cent. The ET applied both
discounts to the award for personal injury (injury to health) and to
the award for loss of earnings. The EAT said this was incorrect: only
the 80 per cent could be deducted from the personal injury award
and only the 33 per cent could be deducted from the financial losses.
Note that the ET can only deal with the personal injury claim
where it is attached to a discrimination claim. If the worker brings no
discrimination claim, s/he would take his/her claim for personal
injury in the county court or High Court in the usual way.80
Despite the practical difficulties, there are some advantages in
bringing such cases in the ET. It can be difficult to find solicitors
willing to do cases on conditional fee arrangements (‘no win, no
fee’) unless the claim is substantial or the worker has legal expenses
insurance. In the ET, at least the worker has access to a relatively
less expensive and less formal procedure. Also, under
discrimination law it is only necessary to prove the psychiatric
injury was directly caused by the act of discrimination.81 It is not
necessary to show the type of injury was reasonably foreseeable.
This is helpful where a worker is more badly hurt by, say, a single
act of discrimination, than anyone might have expected.

Exemplary damages
19.36

Exemplary damages are awarded to punish a wrongdoer. They are
usually awarded in cases involving wrongful arrest and false
imprisonment, but they can in theory also be awarded in employment
discrimination cases.82 The key case of Rookes v Barnard83

established that exemplary damages can be awarded in any of three
situations:
1) where there has been oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by servants of the
government; or
2) where the defendant’s conduct has been calculated to make profit which will exceed the
compensation payable; or
3) where statute says they can be awarded.

In a case against the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in 2010,84 the EAT
said exemplary damages could be awarded on the basis of the first
category, ie ‘oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by
servants of the government’. However, the factual basis for the ET’s
award, ie the failure of the Army to provide a mechanism for redress
of Ms Fletcher’s complaints, though deplorable, was not sufficiently
oppressive to meet the high test for exemplary damages. The EAT
said its view might have been different if the tribunal had instead
based its award on the army’s use of disciplinary action to victimise
Ms Fletcher for pursuing her complaints. Moreover, had an award of
exemplary damages been appropriate (which it was not), the
appropriate level on the facts would have been £7,500, not £50,000.

19.37

Compensation for pregnancy discrimination
In the 1990s, many cases were brought against the MOD by
servicewomen formerly discharged on grounds of pregnancy.
Compensatory awards tended to be very high, mainly because they
referred back to many years of lost earnings and concerned unique
difficulties for wives of service personnel in finding fresh
employment. A few cases laid down some guidelines applicable to
assessing compensation, including the MOD cases specifically and
pregnancy discrimination cases generally.85
Points made by the cases include the following:

19.38

19.39
•

In awarding compensation for loss of earnings after birth, an ET should consider the
chance that a woman would not have returned to work anyway, taking account of work
and family demands.86 It would not be exceptional or even unusual to assess the chance of

a woman’s return as 100 per cent.87 Evidence as to what the woman did in fact do, having
been dismissed, does not necessarily mean she would have done the same had she not
been dismissed.88
•

The order of deductions where a woman mitigates her loss by obtaining new employment
at lesser pay is first to deduct her new earnings from the sum she would have received had
she remained in her original employment and then to make any deduction assessed to
reflect the chance she would not have returned to her original employment.89

•

Concerning the duty to mitigate,90 a woman must actively seek employment six months
after the birth of her child if she wishes to obtain compensation for loss of earnings after
that date.91 However, expectations of what a worker should do to find work should not be
unreasonable, as she is the wronged party.92 Furthermore, an ET is entitled to take into
account its own knowledge and experience of difficulties in the labour market facing
women with young children.93

•

The burden of proving failure to mitigate is on the person alleging it, ie the employer. If no
evidence is given on the failure to mitigate, eg what steps should have been taken and
when, the ET cannot fill the gap by making assumptions about when the worker could have
found fresh employment.94

•

An ET should not allow a woman to be questioned on whether the pregnancy was planned
or unplanned.

Interest
19.40

An ET has a discretion whether to award interest, although arguably
the decision in Marshall v Southampton Area Health Authority (No
2)95 suggests it must always be awarded. The rules should be
referred to for the precise calculation method.96 However, broadly
speaking, interest on an injury to feelings award runs from the date of
the discrimination and, for past financial loss, runs from a date
midway between the act of discrimination and the date of calculation
by the ET. The interest rate is that fixed from time to time by
Judgments Act 1838 s17 (in England and Wales) or by Sheriff Courts
(Scotland) Extracts Act 1892 s19 (in Scotland).97 Since July 2013,
this has been eight per cent.98 To calculate interest on injury to
feelings, multiply the daily rate by the number of days between the
discrimination and the hearing. To find out the daily rate, divide the
amount of the injury to feelings award by 365 and multiply by the

19.41

19.42

interest rate, eg eight per cent. To calculate interest on financial loss,
multiply the daily rate by half the number of days between the
discrimination and the hearing. To find out the daily rate, divide the
sum awarded for financial loss by 365 and multiply by the interest
rate. If the rate of interest has varied during the period for which it
must be calculated, the ET may apply a median or average rate for
the sake of simplicity.99 Interest is not awarded on future financial
loss.100
An ET must consider whether to award interest, even if it is not
invited to do so,101 and in its written reasons must set out how
interest was calculated or, if none has been awarded, explain why
not. It is a good idea to include interest in the Schedule of Loss.102
Interest on unpaid awards runs from the day after the date of the
award unless full payment of the award is made within 14 days of the
relevant decision day.103

ACAS uplift
19.43

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) Code
of Guidance on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures sets out good
practice guidelines for the handling of disciplinary and grievance
issues in employment. An ET may increase or reduce an employee’s
compensation by up to 25 per cent in any successful case for
discrimination104 (as well as unfair dismissal and other specified
areas), because of the employer’s or employee’s unreasonable
failure to follow the Code. If a tribunal has awarded aggravated
damages because of the same procedural failings, it needs to avoid
double-counting. It therefore needs to allow for that, either when
assessing the amount for aggravated damages or when assessing the
uplift for breach of the Code.105 The facts of the particular case need
to fall within the areas covered by Code recommendations. An
example where the Code might apply in a discrimination context
would be where an employee’s dismissal for misconduct was found
to be because of his/her race and the employer had failed to follow
the recommended procedures for disciplinary action. The Code does
not apply and there is therefore no adjustment to compensation for

workers who are not employees. For a further discussion of the Code
and its application, see chapter 22.

Costs against the employer
19.44

Costs may be awarded against either party on the same basis as in
unfair dismissal actions.106 However, the statistics show that costs
are far more frequently awarded against unsuccessful workers in
discrimination cases than against unsuccessful employers.107

Enforcement

the award or settlement, see para 18.72.

•

Winning an unfair dismissal case is mostly about the quality of
the evidence, which is gathered during case preparation.
It is essential that a detailed statement is taken from the
employee as soon as possible while memory is fresh.
Before starting a case, an employee must make an early
conciliation (EC) notification to the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS). This affects tribunal time limits. A
claim cannot be started without the ACAS certificate number
on the form unless an exemption applies.
A case is started when the employee’s written claim on the
standard ET1 form arrives at the Central Office, nominated
tribunal or has gone through online. Time limits are very strict.
Fees are no longer payable. Those who paid fees in the past
should be able to get a refund from the government.
The employee or other person bringing the case is called ‘the
claimant’. The employer or other person against whom the
claim is brought is called ‘the respondent’.
In England and Wales, the tribunal will usually send out
standard case management orders with the tribunal claim or
when the employer’s response is received.
In addition, the employee should ask the employer for any
extra relevant documents and additional information. If these
are not supplied voluntarily, the tribunal must be asked for an
order.
Contemporaneous documents are usually more influential
evidence than witnesses.
It is best to contact possible witnesses at an early stage, while
they are still enthusiastic, and take a signed statement. A
witness order can be obtained if a relevant witness will not
come to the tribunal without one. It is generally unwise to force
a reluctant witness to come.

If the employee is ordered to supply any documents or
additional information to the employer, s/he must comply with
the order in time. Otherwise costs may be ordered against
him/her, or the claim may be struck out.
The employment tribunal (ET) must give at least 14 days’
notice of the final hearing and of any preliminary issues to be
dealt with at a preliminary hearing. Once a hearing date is
fixed, it is extremely difficult to get it changed.
Some hearings may now be conducted over a video platform
due to pandemic restrictions or subsequent backlogs. This
requires special preparation.
If a representative is noted on the ET1, all correspondence will
go to the representative. Make sure the employee is kept
informed and told the hearing date. If no representative is
noted, make sure the employee gets in touch whenever s/he
receives a letter and, in any event, every few weeks.
Every case is allocated an officer from ACAS, who will get in
touch regarding possible settlement. Conversations through
ACAS should not be disclosed to the ET.
There are many advantages in settling a case, provided it is
for a reasonable sum. It avoids recoupment (see para 18.62)
and can include wording for an agreed reference.
An employee must try to get a new job (even if less well paid)
and keep records of all attempts. If the employee does not try
very hard, s/he may not be awarded much compensation.
The employee and any witnesses for either side give oral
evidence at the tribunal. In England and Wales especially,
evidence in chief is almost always contained in witness
statements which are read by the tribunal to itself. Witness
statements are usually exchanged 7–14 days before the
hearing.
Costs can be ordered against a party for various reasons
including unreasonable conduct or that his/her case had no
reasonable prospects of success.

On the whole, this chapter refers to ‘employees’ rather an
‘workers’ as it is primarily concerned with unfair dismissal
claims, but the procedures tend to apply generally.
For quick reference to unfamiliar terms, readers may find the
Glossary at appendix D useful.
There is a checklist of the basic procedural steps in appendix
A at A1 which cross-refers this chapter.

Preliminary steps
Initial steps
20.1

20.2

At the outset it should be established what the employee wants to
achieve. If the employee only wants his/her job back or a good
reference or payment of outstanding wages, holiday or notice pay, it
is not usually advisable to commence a claim for unfair dismissal.
Nothing is more likely to alienate the employer. On the other hand,
starting a claim may be the only way to induce a settlement which
incorporates the monies owing and includes an agreed reference.
Unfortunately, if the case does not settle, an employment tribunal
(ET) cannot order a good reference to be given, even if the employee
wins.
If the priority is to get the employee’s job back, negotiations with
the employer should start immediately, possibly with the intervention
of a third party, eg another employee. The greater the delay in
starting negotiations, the less the likelihood of success. If an
employee simply wants a good written reference or payment of
monies owed, a telephone call or polite letter should be the first
step. Only if the employer refuses, should the employee threaten ET
proceedings. Where a stronger approach is necessary, it is
sometimes effective to send a draft tribunal claim under cover of a
‘without prejudice’1 letter proposing settlement. There is also the
possibility that a negotiation can take place through the Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) early conciliation
(EC) scheme (see below).

20.3

20.4

Before the employee decides to start a case, s/he should be
advised on his/her chances of success, what is involved and the
likely compensation. The employee should be warned that it is
particularly important that s/he makes efforts to find a new job, as
otherwise his/her compensation will be reduced for ‘failure to
mitigate’.2 S/he must keep records of all efforts to find work (see
para 18.34). If the employee’s case is extremely weak, but s/he
seems determined to go ahead anyway, s/he needs to be advised that
there is a risk that costs will be awarded against him/her if s/he
loses. Costs are not routinely ordered in tribunal claims and the fear
of an award should not be a general deterrent, but nevertheless there
are some circumstances where the employee is at risk and needs to
be forewarned. Needless to say, it is important that misconceived
cases are identified and advised not to be started in the first place.
An employee should also be told that judgments (apart from
judgments withdrawing a case) go onto the online register (see para
21.61 onwards regarding the register, privacy and anonymity).
As soon as an employee comes for advice, the adviser should
work out and diarise the last day for lodging a tribunal claim. In
practice, the significant dates will usually be the last day on which
ACAS must be notified under the EC procedure and the further
deadline following issue of the certificate. The employee should also
make a note. Once ET proceedings are started, they move very
quickly. It can take as little as three months from the date the tribunal
claim is lodged to the hearing. If information and documents need to
be gathered, the gathering process must be started immediately. All
time limits and dates for chasing up requests made to the employer
should be diarised. The tribunal claim form is often known as an
‘ET1’.

Collecting information before lodging the ET1
20.5

Before starting the claim, the adviser should get copies of all
relevant documents in the employee’s possession, eg:

•

a statement of the main terms and conditions of employment and/or contract of
employment;

20.6

20.7

20.8

20.9

•

staff handbook;

•

works rules;

•

letter of appointment;

•

letter of dismissal;

•

P45 (which should state the leaving date);

•

payslips;

•

warning letters; and appraisal reports.

There may well be other relevant documents.
It is very important to obtain all documents which may form the
employment contract (see para 1.2). If the employee signed any
statement, document or letter during employment, it is essential to see
this prior to lodging the ET1 if at all possible. It may contain
information relevant to the strength of the case.
The terms of the contract will be particularly vital in relation to a
constructive dismissal claim, where the employee must show a
fundamental breach of contract. If, eg the employee relies on a
change of workplace as such a breach, but the contract contains a
mobility clause, there will be no breach of contract and the claim
will fail.
Once all the employee’s documents are gathered, it is good
practice for the adviser to take a full statement of all the material
facts, concentrating on the reason for dismissal and the events
immediately preceding it. The old-fashioned word for this is a
‘proof’. The final disciplinary hearing leading to dismissal is usually
very important and the adviser should obtain a near verbatim account
while the employee’s memory is relatively fresh. Probe the employee
on the facts, particularly on the weaknesses. The names and
addresses of possible witnesses to significant incidents should be
collected. It is usually easier to establish names and addresses at an
early stage than months later when a witness needs to be written to.
The employee should sign and date the statement and keep a copy.
It should be explained that the statement is only for private use as the
adviser’s working document. If the adviser does not have time to

take a neat statement at this stage, s/he should at least take full and
systematic notes covering all the issues. However, since witness
statements3 eventually need to be written in most cases, it may save
time in the long run to take notes in the shape of a statement and type
these up from the outset. It also helps if any other adviser has to pick
up the file to cover holidays etc.

The first letter and written reasons for the dismissal:
Employment Rights Act 1996 s92
20.10

20.11

20.12

Before starting the claim, the employee should write to the employer
requesting written reasons for the dismissal. The first letter to the
employer is important.4 As well as requesting information which
will be instrumental in the conduct of the case and its final outcome,
it creates an initial impression on the employer which may encourage
settlement later on. The employee should ask for any key documents
which s/he needs at this stage, although this is not the time to ask for
absolutely everything relevant to running a case, and the employer
cannot be compelled to provide documents before a case starts.5 The
employee may have no contractual documents and be uncertain
whether any exist. The employer should therefore at least be asked
for copies of the relevant procedures and the employee’s contract or
statement of particulars of employment.6 This will help in working
out what sums are owing, eg for holiday or notice pay, and may also
contain information needed to assess whether the dismissal was
unfair.
If the employee has at least two years’ minimum service, s/he is
entitled to receive an adequate and truthful statement of the reasons
for dismissal if s/he asks for them.7 This is often referred to as
‘section 92 written reasons’ or ‘written reasons for dismissal’. If
asked for reasons, the employer must supply them within 14 days of
the employee’s request. In order to prove that a request was made, it
is best to make it in writing and send it by recorded delivery or
email.
If the employer unreasonably fails to supply written reasons within
14 days, or supplies reasons which are inadequate or untrue, the

20.13

20.14

20.15

employee is entitled to compensation of two weeks’ gross pay.8 It
seems that there is no upper limit on a week’s pay.9 It is not enough
for an employer to acknowledge the request within the 14 days and
supply reasons later unless, eg the person taking the decision to
dismiss was on holiday. Note that the test is whether the employer
unreasonably ‘failed’ to provide written reasons, not whether s/he
unreasonably ‘refused’ to do so, which would be harder to prove.
The wording of the legislation was changed in 1993 to replace the
word ‘refused’ with ‘failed’ and, if reading any of the older caselaw, that change of wording must be borne in mind.
The written reasons must be adequate so that it is clear to the
employee and to anyone else why the employee was dismissed and
upon which of the potentially fair reasons for dismissal10 the
employer relies.11 The purpose of the right is to make the employer
state truthfully the reason for dismissing. The reason need not be
truthful in the sense of an accurate judgment about the claimant. It
only needs to be the employer’s true reason for dismissal. Any
statement given by the employer is admissible in unfair dismissal
proceedings and will be important in determining the fairness of the
dismissal.12 Moreover, in deciding whether to award compensation
for inadequate or untrue reasons, the ET is not concerned with
whether the reasons given were intrinsically good or bad.13 If the
reason was bad, the dismissal will doubtless be unfair, but there will
be no award for the written reasons claim.
The time limit for a claim for failure to supply adequate and true
reasons is the same as for unfair dismissal. Even if reasons are
supplied within 14 days, an Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s92
claim should usually be added to the unfair dismissal claim (see ET1
in appendix C for an example). You can never be sure what will
emerge during the unfair dismissal hearing about the truth of the
reasons given.
It is important to remember that no compensation can be claimed if
the employer does not provide written reasons or provides
inadequate or untrue reasons, unless the employer was asked to
provide them in the first place. However, women dismissed while

pregnant or on maternity leave are entitled to written reasons,
whether or not they request them, and regardless of their length of
service.14 This is logical because they can claim unfair dismissal for
reasons related to pregnancy or maternity, even if they do not have
the necessary length of service for ordinary unfair dismissal claims.
If the reasons are not supplied, a claim should be made in the usual
way. Even though it is not necessary in a pregnancy/maternity case, it
is probably still worth asking the employer for reasons where they
are not volunteered.

ACAS early conciliation
20.16

20.17

20.18

The introduction of EC and the attempted introduction of fees were
just two of a number of radical changes to employment law and the
tribunal system introduced by the Conservative and Liberal
Democrat coalition government in the period 2010–2015. These
included an increase in the unfair dismissal qualifying period to two
years; removal of non-legal members from tribunal panels hearing
unfair dismissal claims; and the end of payment by the tribunal
system of witness expenses.
It is now compulsory to go through the ACAS EC procedure
unless one of the exceptions applies. This section regarding EC
needs to be read together with the section on time limits and
procedure for starting a tribunal claim below. There is a broad
outline of the EC scheme on the ACAS website, but remember that it
is only general non-technical guidance and has no legal status.
The EC scheme applies to ‘relevant proceedings’ in the ET.15
These are mainly set out in a list in Employment Tribunals Act (ETA)
1996 s18(1). Virtually all employment rights are covered, including
claims for unfair dismissal; written reasons for dismissal; notice pay;
discrimination; equal pay; redundancy pay; collective redundancy
consultation; unauthorised deductions from pay; pay slips; statutory
holiday entitlement; less favourable treatment of part-timers and
fixed-term employees; flexible working; time off for antenatal care;
agency workers’ rights; and detriments due to whistleblowing or
related to pregnancy and maternity. The scheme also applies to the

right to be accompanied to a disciplinary or grievance hearing,16 and
to failure to inform or consult on a TUPE transfer.17 There are a
number of obscure rights which are not covered by the scheme. The
one which you are most likely to come across is an application to the
secretary of state for payment where the employer is insolvent.18
Employers’ contract claims are also not covered.
Even if the claim is covered by the EC process, the claimant has a
choice whether or not to make an EC notification if one of the
following circumstances apply, ie where:19

20.19

•

The employee wants to make a claim with someone else on the same form, and the other
person has already notified ACAS under the EC rules.

•

The claim form includes claims which are not covered by the EC procedure.

•

The employee can show that the prospective respondent has already contacted ACAS in
relation to a dispute, the employee has not notified ACAS in relation to that dispute and the
proceedings on the claim form relate to that dispute.

•

It is an unfair dismissal claim and the tribunal claim will be accompanied by an application
for interim relief.

•

The claim is against the Security Service, Secret Intelligence Service, or the Government
Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).

20.20

20.21

If the employee decides to enter the EC process in these
circumstances, ACAS must follow the procedure in the usual way.
Assuming the EC procedure applies, employees will be blocked
from starting a tribunal claim if they have not first obtained a
certificate from ACAS in relation to the relevant respondents. The
only way to get an ACAS certificate is to follow the EC process.
Employees cannot be forced to negotiate, but they must at least make
the initial notification to ACAS. The procedure is set out in the Early
Conciliation Rules of Procedure (EC Rules) 2014, which are
contained in the Schedule to the Employment Tribunals (Early
Conciliation: Exemptions and Rules of Procedure) Regulations
2014.20
The employee is known as the ‘prospective claimant’. As a first
step, s/he must notify ACAS by telephone or, preferably, by using the
online form on the ACAS website21 or by posting a hard copy to the

20.22

20.23

20.24

ACAS address which is on the form. ACAS will acknowledge the
form by email (if the claimant gave an email address) or by post.
Employees should make sure they get confirmation of safe receipt
straight away. The only compulsory information on the form is the
name and address both of the prospective claimant and of the
prospective respondent (ie the employer or other person against
whom the employee intends to make a claim).22 The employee does
not need to say what his/her claim will be about. An EC certificate
can cover future events, provided there is some loose connection
with the claim, eg an employee notifies ACAS about events at work
which are making her unhappy, but only resigns because of those
events after the EC certificate is issued, and then brings a
constructive dismissal claim.23
It is important that the employee gets the name of the prospective
respondent right. If the employee invokes EC against a prospective
respondent with one name and ultimately issues a tribunal claim
against a respondent with a different name, the tribunal claim may not
be allowed.24 If the prospective claim will be against more than one
respondent, the claimant can now put all the names on a single EC
form.25
On receiving the form, ACAS will try to contact the employee. If
ACAS cannot make contact with the employee, they will keep trying
for a while, but eventually they will give up and issue a certificate.26
Once contact is made, if the employee does not want to take up the
offer of EC, ACAS will issue a certificate immediately.27 ACAS
will also issue an immediate certificate if the employer is insolvent.
It is not the role of ACAS to assess the strength of the case or to
discourage weak cases.
Provided the employee wants to try negotiation, an ACAS
conciliator will then contact the prospective respondent. If the
conciliator is unable to make contact with the prospective
respondent, or if the prospective respondent is uninterested in EC,
the conciliator will issue a certificate.28 Respondents sometimes
complain later at the tribunal that ACAS did not get in contact with
them. The most likely explanation is that ACAS were unable to make

20.25

20.26

20.27

contact and having failed to do so after making reasonable attempts,
were entitled to give up.29
If both sides want to negotiate, the conciliator has up to six weeks
from when ACAS was originally notified by telephone or receipt of
the form.30 If a settlement is reached, ACAS will record it on a
COT3 form. If negotiations collapse during the EC period or if no
settlement has been achieved by the end of the period, the conciliator
must issue an EC certificate.31
The EC certificate is a crucial document. Until it is issued, the
claimant cannot start his/her tribunal claim. The certificate records
the name and address of the prospective claimant (the employee) and
the prospective respondent; the date of receipt of the written or
telephone EC notification; the date of issue of the certificate, ie the
date it is sent, a statement of the method by which the certificate is
sent; and the unique reference number given by ACAS to the
certificate.32 The certificate will be emailed to the employee or if
s/he has no email address, it will be posted.33 If ACAS has had
contact with the prospective respondents, they should be sent a copy
too. This does not always seem to happen, which can cause
problems. The ACAS conciliation period extends the time limits for
starting a tribunal claim,34 and if the respondents do not see the dates
on the certificate, they tend to challenge the claim as out of time in
the tribunal. To avoid this problem, some tribunals send a copy of the
certificate to the respondents.
In rare instances, a prospective respondent may contact ACAS
first, eg an employer who anticipates that the employee is about to
bring a tribunal claim. ACAS is obliged to try to conciliate of this
happens.35 If the employee is uninterested in negotiating or no
settlement is agreed, the employee can go ahead and make a tribunal
claim without having notified ACAS him/herself. This is because
one of the exceptions applies.36 It is important to be very careful
about the rules in this situation. The wording of the exception causes
uncertainties in practice, especially where more than one respondent
is involved.

Fees
20.28

20.29

20.30

20.31

20.32

In 1968, the Donovan Report recommended that labour tribunals be
set up to provide ‘an easily accessible, speedy, informal and
inexpensive procedure’ for the settlement of employment disputes.
As a result, the jurisdiction of Industrial Tribunals was extended to
cover a variety of employment rights. In 1998, Industrial Tribunals
were renamed Employment Tribunals.
One of the most radical and controversial changes to the tribunal
system in recent years was the attempted introduction of fees. Until
the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government
introduced fees on 29 July 2013, workers could bring cases in an ET
and appeal to the EAT without paying a fee. Fees were then charged
until their abolition following R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor37 in
July 2017.
After the introduction of fees, there was a dramatic and persistent
fall in the number of claims brought in ETs. Comparing the figures
preceding the introduction of fees with periods immediately before
the UNISON decision, there was a long-term reduction in ET claims
of 66–70 per cent.
Following a long fight by UNISON, which brought a judicial
review against the government challenging the fees, the Supreme
Court decided that the Fees Order was unlawful under both domestic
law (going back to Magna Carta) and EU law, because it had the
effect of preventing access to justice. The landmark judgment, R
(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor,38 makes essential reading. The
Supreme Court noted that, for some people, the fees were simply
unaffordable. Even for those who could afford them, they were so
high that they in practice prevented people from pursuing claims for
small amounts and non-monetary claims. The Supreme Court said
that, where households on low to middle incomes can only afford
fees by sacrificing the ordinary and reasonable expenditure required
to maintain what would generally be regarded as an acceptable
standard of living, the fees cannot be regarded as affordable.
The Supreme Court rejected the government’s underlying
assumption that the administration of justice is merely a public

service like any other, that courts and tribunals are providers of
services to the ‘users’ who appear before them, and that the
provision of those services is of value only to the users themselves.
It said the constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the
rule of law. In a very important passage, the Supreme Court
highlighted the democratic importance of access to the courts (para
68):
At the heart of the concept of the rule of law is the idea that society is governed by law.
Parliament exists primarily in order to make laws for society in this country. Democratic
procedures exist primarily in order to ensure that the Parliament which makes those laws
includes Members of Parliament who are chosen by the people of this country and are
accountable to them. Courts exist in order to ensure that the laws made by Parliament, and
the common law created by the courts themselves, are applied and enforced. That role
includes ensuring that the executive branch of government carries out its functions in
accordance with the law. In order for the courts to perform that role, people must in
principle have unimpeded access to them. Without such access, laws are liable to become a
dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic
election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.
20.33

The Supreme Court went on to say that the idea that bringing a claim
before a court or a tribunal is a purely private activity and provides
no broader social benefit is untenable. Access to the courts is not of
value only to the particular individuals involved. That is most
obviously true of cases which establish principles of general
importance, but it is more than that:
People and businesses need to know, on the one hand, that they will be able to enforce their
rights if they have to do so, and, on the other hand, that if they fail to meet their obligations,
there is likely to be a remedy against them. It is that knowledge which underpins everyday
economic and social relations. That is so, notwithstanding that judicial enforcement of the
law is not usually necessary, and notwithstanding that the resolution of disputes by other
methods is often desirable.

20.34

ETs immediately stopped charging fees on the decision of the
Supreme Court, and the government set up a system for reimbursing
fees which had been paid in the past. Over 22,000 applications for

refunds have been received and £18.5 million repaid. The system for
reclaiming fees is set out on the GOV.UK website.39 Since the
abolition of fees, the numbers of cases presented to the tribunal have
hugely increased although, at the time of writing, they have not yet
reached pre-fees levels.40 The Covid pandemic is likely to have
affected and to continue to affect case numbers, initially with a
reduction in cases presented and then a likely increase after furlough
protection stops and redundancies are made.

The employment tribunal website
20.35

HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), an agency of the
Ministry of Justice, is responsible for the administration of civil and
criminal courts and tribunals in England and Wales and nondevolved tribunals in Scotland. Information regarding employment
tribunals is hosted on GOV.UK. The best place to start is the page
headed, ‘Make a claim to an employment tribunal’,41 and follow the
links.

The ET Rules of Procedure
20.36

20.37

Although this chapter is concerned with running unfair dismissal
cases (and therefore refers to ‘employees’ throughout), the
procedural rules are basically the same with all ET cases. However,
different cases and types of claim do vary in length and complexity.
Additional points relevant to discrimination cases are in chapter 21,
and to equal pay claims in chapter 5.42
The current procedural rules regarding the preparation and hearing
of cases in England, Wales and Scotland are contained in the
Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure)
Regulations (ET Regs) 2013 (also referred to in this chapter as the
‘2013 rules’).43 Until 2004, there were separate rules for Scotland,
which has developed certain different practices in its tribunals.
Although there is great similarity, there are some practical
differences which may not be covered by this book. It should also be
checked that such differences in Scotland which are referred to here

still reflect the position. Power over the operation and management
of ETs in Scotland is devolved to the Scottish Government. It is
therefore possible that changes will be made in the future to rules for
Scotland.
As well as the procedural rules, the President of the Employment
Tribunals (England and Wales) and the President of the Employment
Tribunals (Scotland) have power to issue practice directions and
presidential guidance on certain topics.44 This includes presidential
guidance for England and Wales on general case management.
Different guidance may be issued for tribunals in England and Wales
and for Scotland by the respective Presidents. Tribunals must have
regard to such guidance, but they are not bound to follow it as a
matter of law.45 The guidance is intended to assist both the parties
and the tribunals and to help promote consistency.
Under the 2013 rules, tribunals have great powers and flexibility
to make decisions, but this is balanced by fair process, notification
and consultation of parties. The ‘overriding objective’46 of the rules
is often referred to. Its purpose is to enable tribunals to deal with
cases fairly and justly. This includes, so far as is practicable:

20.38

20.39

•

ensuring the parties are on an equal footing;

•

dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the complexity and importance of
the issues;

20.40

•

avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings;

•

avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues; and

•

saving expense.

The parties and their representatives are supposed to assist the
tribunal in achieving the overriding objective. In addition, the 2013
rules introduced a specific requirement that the parties co-operate
with each other as well as with the tribunal.
An ET must give effect to the overriding objective when
exercising its procedural powers. This is constantly referred to by
the tribunal when making decisions as to what orders should be made
for documents and information, and in deciding the length and
conduct of the hearing.

20.41

The overriding objective was introduced in 2001. There are
considerable resource pressures on the tribunal system, partly due to
constantly expanding areas of employment law and partly due to
financial cuts which the justice system has faced along with the rest
of society since 2010. Everyone agrees it is important that external
resource pressures do not corrode the objectives of justice. The EAT
has recognised, albeit in the context of a discrimination case, that
there can be a tension between what expedition requires and what
fairness requires. If so, in the end, justice should be preferred to
expedition.47 Article 6 (the right to a fair hearing) of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is also an important
safeguard.48

The tribunal claim (ET1)
Starting a case
20.42

20.43

20.44

A case is started when the employee (known as the ‘claimant’)49
presents a written claim on an approved (‘prescribed’) form
containing the necessary information.50 This is known as the
‘claim’,51 but it is also often referred to by the number of the
standard form, ie ‘ET1’. Much information can be obtained from the
HMCTS website, which contains the approved ET1 form and
various guidance notes and leaflets.52
Claimants are encouraged to use the online submission service,
which is also available in Welsh. Alternatively, a hard copy of the
claim form can be printed off the website and posted to the
appropriate Central Office (the addresses are on the HMCTS
website under ‘Make a claim by post’). It may be permissible to
deliver the claim by hand to certain tribunals, but it is best to check
the latest rules for that.
An employee needs to think carefully before starting a case, if s/he
is unsure that s/he will want to see it through. Although technically
s/he can withdraw at any time, the longer the case goes on, the
greater the risk that costs will be awarded against him/her for
unreasonable conduct if s/he casually withdraws having put the

employer through a lot of unnecessary expense.53 It is also worth
checking whether the employer is insolvent or unlikely to pay any
award. Although some debts are covered by the state, these will be
relatively small sums.54 A Company Search can be carried out on the
WebCheck service of Companies House.55 When the company name
is typed in, the website shows a list of companies with similar
names. Click on the company number of the correct name (in the lefthand column) and the correct page will open. It tells you if the
company has been dissolved and, if not, when accounts were last
filed, which is usually a good indicator of the employer’s financial
health. The site may be a few weeks behind actual events.

Time limits
20.45

20.46

20.47

The time limit for lodging an unfair dismissal claim is within three
months from dismissal, which is far shorter than that for other civil
claims. The time limit is strictly enforced, with an extension only in
exceptional circumstances. This section must be read together with
para 20.56 onwards regarding the effect of ACAS EC on time limits.
The period of three calendar months runs from the effective date of
termination (EDT). This means three calendar months less one day.56
If the EDT is 18 May, the claim must be presented on or before
midnight on 17 August.57 Where EC applies (see below), ACAS
must be notified by that time limit and the claim must then be
presented to the tribunal within a set period after the ACAS
certificate is issued. It is always risky to leave presentation of the
claim to the last minute, because things tend to go wrong. It is
legitimate to expect first-class post to arrive on the second day after
posting, provided that it is not a Sunday or bank holiday.58 If it is
unexpectedly delayed, this may be a ground for allowing a late
claim, but it is extremely risky to rely on this. If using the interactive
online form on the HMCTS website and it does not go through, the
claim will not be presented unless it can be proved it arrived at least
at the server hosting the website.59
For time limit purposes, the EDT means:

•

when the contract is terminated by notice, the date that the notice expires;60

•

when the contract is terminated without notice, the date on which termination takes
effect.61 With a summary dismissal for gross misconduct, this will be the last day worked.

20.48

However, where there is no gross misconduct and notice is required,
if the employer pays money in lieu of notice, the EDT can be
ambiguous. Either the employer has terminated the contract of
employment with immediate effect and made a payment in lieu of
notice, or the employer has terminated the contract from the end of
the notice period, but does not require the employee to attend work
in the interim. The dismissal letter or P45 may indicate which is the
case. Usually when the employer pays in lieu of notice, the EDT is
the last day actually worked and it is safest when calculating time
limits to work from this date. Indeed, it is a useful rule of thumb to
present the claim within three months of the last day worked (unless
the employee is off sick or on holiday during his/her last weeks). By
doing this, the claim will always be in time. If the employee is absent
due to sickness or holiday at the end of his/her employment, the EDT
takes place when the contract of employment actually terminates.
Where a dismissal is communicated by letter, the EDT is the date
the employee actually reads the letter, not the date it is written,
posted or delivered (unless the contract of employment explicitly
says otherwise). If the employee does not immediately read the letter,
eg because s/he is on holiday or even because s/he deliberately
avoids reading it, the EDT is when s/he would in the circumstances
have had a reasonable opportunity of doing so.62 Playing it safe, it is
best just to count time from the date of the letter. If the employer
notifies the employee’s solicitors or advisers of the dismissal before
writing direct to the employee, it is possible that the date the
solicitors or advisers were notified is the dismissal date.63 Another
uncertain situation can arise where the employer says, verbally or in
writing, words to the effect: ‘You are dismissed. I am giving you
three months’ notice. You will be paid, but please do not come into
work.’ Unless there is something in the employee’s contract of
employment or other external circumstances which says otherwise,
notice in that instance would start to be counted on the next day.64 So

for example, in the absence of any indication that it should be
otherwise, if the employee received three months’ notice on 3
November, this would start to be counted on 4 November and the
termination date would be 3 February.65 Strictly speaking, any
ambiguity in the dismissal letter which could mislead the employee
as to the termination date should be interpreted by the tribunals
against the writer of the letter (the employer) and in favour of the
employee.66 Nevertheless, to repeat, the law and factual scenarios
can be varied and complex; in all circumstances it is best to
calculate time limits based on the earliest possible date and not to
leave things to the last day.

Late claims
20.49

20.50
20.51

Exceptionally, the ET will allow a late claim provided it was not
reasonably practicable to present the claim in time, and it was
presented within such further period as the ET considers
reasonable.67 It is for the employee to show that it was not
reasonably practicable to present the claim in time.68 A tribunal
should give the test a liberal interpretation in favour of the
employee.69 Nevertheless, it is very difficult to make unfair
dismissal claims out of time.
Physical or mental70 disability or ill-health can be a good reason
for missing a time limit, depending on the circumstances and timing.
It may be that the employee missed the deadline because s/he was
unaware of the right to claim unfair dismissal or how to do so or
what the time limits were. What is relevant is the employee’s state of
mind and the extent to which s/he understood his/her position.71
Ignorance will be an acceptable excuse only if the ignorance or
mistaken belief is itself reasonable. It will not be reasonable if the
employee did not make reasonable enquiries in the circumstances.72
If the employee knows s/he has employment rights, s/he would
normally be expected to have asked about those rights and therefore
have found out about time limits.

20.52

20.53

20.54

20.55

Ignorance of a fact which is crucial to a claim can make it not
reasonably practicable,73 eg if a redundant employee finds out only
after the expiry of the time limit that s/he was immediately replaced
by someone else.
Employees cannot just await the outcome of their appeal against
dismissal if it has not been decided within the ET time limit. The
mere fact of a pending appeal is rarely in itself sufficient grounds to
make it not reasonably practicable to get the claim in on time, if the
employee is – or should have been – aware of the time limits.
However, if an employee is reasonably ignorant of the relevant time
limits, and as a result awaits the outcome of an internal appeal
before investigating the possibility of a tribunal claim, an ET may
decide it was not reasonably practicable to get a claim in on time.74
Equally, if the employee has been told by ACAS to go through the
internal procedure first and there has been no discussion about time
limits for starting a claim, some ETs may allow a late claim if the
employee acts promptly once the appeal is decided.75 A genuine and
reasonable misunderstanding of the EC procedure leading to the
rejection of an employee’s original claim and the consequential
lateness of a second, corrected, claim, could make it not reasonably
practicable to have presented the corrected claim in time.76
It is unlikely that the employee can rely on the fact that it was
his/her solicitor who wrongly put in a late claim on his/her behalf77
– his/her remedy is to sue the solicitor for negligence. However, if a
solicitor simply gave wrong advice and the employee retained
responsibility for lodging the claim form, the employee may be able
to argue that it was not reasonably practicable for him/her to get the
claim in on time.78 If the employee was misled by the advice of a
Citizens Advice Bureau, it will depend on who gave the advice
within the Bureau and in what circumstances.79
Even if the employee shows that it was not reasonably practicable
to present the claim in time, s/he must do so within a further
reasonable period. The employee must act promptly once s/he
discovers that the claim is out of time.80

The effect of early conciliation on time limits
Where the ACAS EC process applies, there is an extension of time
limits. The idea is that the time taken for the EC process is added on
to the usual tribunal time limit. This is done by not counting the
period starting with the day after ‘Day A’ and ending with ‘Day B’.81
‘Day A’ is the day when the claimant first contacted ACAS under the
EC process. ‘Day B’ is the day when the claimant received or, if
earlier, is treated as receiving, the EC certificate. Where the
certificate was emailed, it is deemed to have been received on the
date it was sent.82 If it was sent by post, it is deemed received on the
day when it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.83 For
example, the claimant is dismissed on 12 February 2021. The
original unfair dismissal time limit would be 11 May 2021. The
claimant notifies ACAS on 5 March 2021 (Day A). The claimant is
not interested in negotiating and the ACAS certificate is issued and
emailed to the claimant on 9 March 2021 (Day B). The period to be
discounted is 6 March–9 March 2021 inclusive (four days). The
extended tribunal time limit is 15 May 2021 (11 May + four days).
If the extended tribunal time limit would expire during the period
starting with Day A (notification of ACAS) and ending one month
after Day B (receipt of the certificate), the new time limit will expire
instead one month after Day B. ‘One month after’ means the
corresponding date in the next calendar month, eg if Day B is 30 June
2021, the time limit will expire on 30 July 2021.84 This ensures that
a claimant has at least one month after receiving the ACAS
certificate (or being deemed to receive it) to present the tribunal
claim. The one month is a minimum period, not a maximum.85 If EC
is started and completed early, there may well be longer than one
month left to present a claim after the certificate is issued. For
example in an unfair dismissal claim:

20.56

20.57

•

The EDT is 20 June 2021, Day A (notification of ACAS) is 22 July 2021 and Day B
(receipt of the certificate) is 22 August 2021.

•

There are 31 days from the day after Day A to Day B inclusive.

•

The new time limit is 20 October 2021, ie the original unfair dismissal time limit of 19
September 2021 plus 31 days. It is not 22 September 2021 (one month after Day B).

There is a further permutation, where the original time limit would
not even have started to run before the EC notification is made
and/or EC certificate is issued. This could happen, for example, with
an unfair dismissal case where a claimant works a lengthy notice
period. The claimant might make his/her EC notification to ACAS as
soon as s/he is given notice and prior to the termination date. If the
certificate is also issued before the usual tribunal time limit would
start to be counted, it seems likely there is no extension to allow for
any conciliation period.86 Test cases on how the time limit extension
operates are still coming through and should be watched.
Overall, the claimant therefore needs to keep two dates in mind.
First, the original time limit applying to unfair dismissal, or
whatever is the employment right in question. ACAS must be notified
before that time limit expires. Second, the extra time for submitting a
claim to the tribunal following receipt of the ACAS certificate. If the
claimant is late at either of these stages, the tribunal will have to
decide whether to allow a late claim in the usual way. A claimant
cannot try to get around the problem by notifying ACAS again of EC
and getting another EC certificate. Only time taken for conciliation
under the first certificate will count for the purposes of extending the
tribunal time limit.87 If the claimant fails to notify ACAS within the
original time limit, but does so subsequently, s/he will not get the
benefit of any extension under the rules. The time limit for presenting
the claim to the tribunal will remain as it always was, regardless of
the length of any conciliation.88

20.58

20.59

Drafting the tribunal claim
Under the ET Regs 2013, the following information must be set out in
a tribunal claim:89

20.60

•

The employee’s name and address. The employee is called the ‘claimant’. If there is more
than one claimant, the name and address of each must be entered on the form.

•

The employer’s name and address. The employer is called the ‘respondent’.

•

The ACAS EC number for each named respondent, or confirmation that the claim does not
start any ‘relevant proceedings’ or that one of the EC exemptions applies.

20.61

20.62

20.63

20.64

As already stated, claimants must use an approved (‘prescribed’)
tribunal form (ET1). The current approved form can be found as a
pdf on GOV.UK.90 It can be printed off and completed by hand or
completed online and then printed. Alternatively, an application can
be made interactively. Unlike the pdf, the interactive form does not
have numbered paragraphs.
The respondent in an unfair dismissal claim will be the claimant’s
employer. This is often a company (check headed notepaper and any
written contract), though it can also be an individual with a trading
name, eg ‘Bill Roberts trading as Cactus Developments’ or an
unincorporated association. If uncertain about the precise name or
address of an employing company, a search can be done on the
Companies House website.91
An employee who is employed by an unincorporated association
is employed by its management or executive committee, not by all the
members of the association. ETs will usually accept a claim which
simply names the association as respondent, but strictly speaking it
should name the members of the committee when the cause of action
arose, eg when the employee was dismissed. Sometimes a claim is
made against a representative respondent, ie a member of the
committee, who is sued both in his/her own name and as a
representative of the committee. However, questions may arise as to
the right of other members to be kept informed and to have their say,
and also as to whether it is necessary to name all the individuals in
order to be able to enforce against any one of them.92 An even more
difficult area concerns teachers and support staff working in schools,
where quite technical questions can arise as to whether they are
employed for the purposes of the unfair dismissal claim by the local
education authority or the governing body of the school. This is an
area where specialist legislation can apply and is beyond the scope
of this book.93
A claimant can make several claims on a single ET1 form, for
example a claim for unfair dismissal, notice pay and written reasons

20.65

20.66

for dismissal; or for race discrimination and unfair dismissal.94 At
section 8.1 of the pdf form (page 8 of the interactive form), the
claimant is asked to tick one or more boxes indicating the type of
claim s/he is bringing. It is very important to spell out more details
of any box that has been ticked when going on to complete section
8.2.
At section 8.2 of the pdf form (page 9 of the interactive form),
claimants are asked to set out the background and details of their
claim or claims. It is important to remember that the tribunal claim
will probably be the first document read by the employment judge or
ET panel before the hearing starts and it will give them a strong early
impression of the merits of the case. It is, therefore, foolish to give
only very brief details of the claim.95 A well written ET1 can also
assist the case preparation to run more smoothly, eg by making a
preliminary hearing less likely, eliciting a more detailed response
from the employer, making it easier to obtain interim orders from the
tribunal and improving the chances of settlement.
The ET1 should state all the key facts and dates, but without going
into laborious detail. It is not supposed to be a full witness
statement.96 It should be more of a summary, which gives a reader an
overview of what happened and why it is thought to be unlawful. The
essentials are usually:
1) the legal basis for the claim, eg unfair dismissal or race discrimination;
2) the act or omission complained of, eg dismissal or lack of promotion;
3) who carried out the action complained of;
4) when it occurred;
5) why the claimant is complaining about the relevant action; and
6) anything affecting remedy.97

As a very rough rule of thumb, details of an unfair dismissal claim
should not normally need more than two pages and the events should
usually be described in chronological order. Details which run to
over 15 or 20 pages and read more like a witness statement, even if
they are written clearly, are unnecessarily lengthy. An ET cannot
simply refuse to accept a claim form because it is too long,98 but it

20.67

20.68

20.69

may get rejected on initial consideration if the details are so
incoherent that it cannot sensibly be responded to by the employer.99
It helps when completing the form to think about the relevant law
and therefore what issues are relevant or irrelevant. For example, if
the employer is a large company, this should be stated in the ET1,
since the tribunal must consider fairness in the light of the
employer’s size and administrative resources.
In an unfair dismissal case, it is best to complete the ET1 bearing
in mind what the employer must do for a dismissal to be fair. The
claimant can then draw attention to what the employer ought to have
done but did not. For example, in a conduct case, it is of little
assistance to focus on the employee’s innocence of the misconduct or
to refer to matters occurring after dismissal, eg the police’s decision
to drop charges. What is relevant is the employer’s genuine and
reasonable belief at the time of dismissal, whether the employer had
reasonable grounds for that belief, and the extent of the investigations
into the employee’s guilt including the opportunity afforded to the
employee to offer an explanation. The ET1 should focus on these
points, eg highlighting inadequacies in the investigation. If there are
obvious weaknesses in the case, they cannot be hidden and it may be
best to refer to them in the ET1 and offer as convincing an
explanation as possible. For the above reasons, it is almost always
better for an adviser who understands the law to write the ET1 rather
than ask the claimant to write his/her own, even if the adviser intends
to amend it. Sample tribunal claims are in appendix A, but these
should not be copied slavishly. Every case is unique.
At section 9 of the pdf form and page 10 of the interactive form,
claimants are asked what outcome they would prefer if they are
successful. This includes asking for their job back if they win their
unfair dismissal claim. Although a claimant can change his/her mind
later, it improves his/her chances of getting a reinstatement order if
s/he has indicated at the outset that that is what s/he is seeking. The
form also asks claimants to set out how much financial compensation
they are claiming and how they calculated the sum, insofar as they
are able to do so. Although this may be difficult for claimants to do,

20.70

it is helpful for them to understand from the outset how compensation
is calculated for the types of claim they are making and the
limitations of the tribunal’s powers. The option of recommendations
only applies to discrimination claims (see chapter 19).
If the adviser puts him/herself down as the claimant’s
representative, s/he will receive all the correspondence from the ET
and employer, and s/he must keep the claimant informed. The ET
will expect the adviser or someone else from the adviser’s
organisation to represent the claimant at hearings unless notified
otherwise. If the adviser is not noted as representative on the form,
correspondence goes to the claimant, who must be forewarned to
keep in close touch with the adviser, even if nothing happens for four
or five weeks. An adviser can later take over the running of a case,
simply by writing to the ET and to the employer to notify them of
this.

Amending the tribunal claim
20.71

A tribunal claim can be amended at any time, but the claimant needs
the tribunal’s permission. In deciding whether to allow an
amendment, the ET must take account of all the circumstances and
balance the hardship and injustice of refusing the amendment against
that of allowing it.100 Where the amendment is to add new facts and
grounds, the ET must decide if the new claim is in time and, if not,
whether the amendment should now be allowed. If the claim arises
out of the same facts as the original claim but simply adds factual
details or attaches a new legal label, the ET should very readily
allow the amendment even if outside the time limit.101 For example, a
claimant may describe a sequence of events leading to a dismissal
which s/he labels as unfair under the EqA 2010. The same facts
could also support a claim of ordinary unfair dismissal under the
Employment Rights Act 1996, provided s/he was eligible. On the
other hand, if the amendment is to introduce an entirely new cause of
action dependent on quite different facts, it is more difficult. The
greater the difference between the factual and legal issues raised by
the new claim and the old, the less likely it is that an amendment will

20.72

20.73

20.74

20.75

be allowed, but it is always a matter for the tribunal’s discretion.102
It is important to remember that whether the new claim would be out
of time if it were a free-standing claim (including whether the test for
extending time for the relevant claim would be satisfied) is only one
factor.103 Other factors would be why the new claim was not
originally included and how late in the day the amendment is sought.
By far the most important consideration is the balance of hardship
and injustice of allowing the amendment as against refusing it. The
tribunal should think about the real practical consequences. If the
amendment is refused, how severe will be the consequences for the
party seeking it? If it is allowed, what will be the practical problems
for the other party in responding. The tribunal should focus on reality
rather than assumptions. Representatives should actually find out
whether witnesses can still remember the events, whether documents
have been destroyed etc. They should not argue that they would be
prejudiced by the amendment if that is not really true. If there is no
real prejudice caused by the amendment, it will often be appropriate
to consent to it.104
The result of allowing a new claim to be added by an amendment
is that it takes effect from the date when permission to amend was
given. The ET must make a separate decision on whether it is timebarred under the usual rules for late claims. This may be decided at
the same time as the amendment is allowed (usually at a preliminary
hearing) or it may be left to the final hearing if for example it is
dependent on evidence as to whether there was continuing
discrimination. It is even possible for the decision on both
amendment and time limits to be left to the final hearing.105
As well as legal difficulties, claimants can sometimes be
discredited in terms of evidence if they appear to have changed their
mind from what they originally wrote in the tribunal claim. Overall,
it can be difficult for several reasons to amend a claim out of time. It
is therefore important for an adviser to spend enough time with the
claimant at the outset to identify and evaluate all possible claims.
An ET has power to order an additional party to be joined at any
time,106 eg in a TUPE case where it becomes clear that the other

party to the transfer should be joined, or in a discrimination case,
when it is necessary to join an individual discriminator. See para
20.85 regarding whether it is necessary to go through ACAS EC
prior to adding a new party.

Procedure for accepting the claim
20.76

20.77

20.78

On receiving the claim, the tribunal decides whether to accept it. If
everything is in order, the claimant will be sent a standard
acknowledgment form. A copy of the claim will be sent to the
respondent, who has 28 days to respond. The case will be allocated
a case number, which must be quoted on all correspondence or
telephone contact with the tribunal. The acceptance of the claim form
does not mean the tribunal has accepted that time limits have
necessarily been complied with. Any problem with time limits is
likely to come up later in the process.
All or part of the claim will be rejected if the form does not
include all the required information (see para 20.60) or if an
employment judge considers it is written in a way which cannot
sensibly be responded to or that it is otherwise an abuse of
process.107 It may also be rejected if there is no jurisdiction to hear
the claim, although some jurisdictional issues may only come up
later. If all or part of the claim is rejected on any of these grounds,
the form will be returned to the claimant with a written explanation
for the decision and information on how to apply for a
reconsideration of the rejection.108 A fresh claim form will also be
enclosed. If the claimant does nothing, his/her claim will not be
started.
The claimant can apply for a reconsideration of the decision to
reject the form within 14 days of the date that the rejection notice
was sent. The claimant must either explain why the original decision
was wrong or must rectify the defect leading to the rejection of the
form.109 If the claimant wants a hearing to decide whether the claim
should now be allowed, s/he should say so. Otherwise, a judge will
decide the matter on the basis of the papers. If a judge has decided to
allow the claim, no hearing will be held anyway. Any hearing which

20.79

20.80

20.81

20.82

20.83

is held on this point will be with the claimant alone. If the original
rejection was correct, but the defect is subsequently rectified, the
claim will be treated as presented on the date that the defect was
rectified. This could cause problems with time limits for starting a
claim.
One reason why the claim form may be rejected is if there is no
ACAS certificate number unless it is indicated one of the exceptions
applies. The claim will also be rejected if an EC exemption is
claimed which does not in fact apply. A tribunal has no general
discretion to allow in claims just because there are exceptional
circumstances.110
The ACAS certificate number must be entered accurately on the
ET1, as the claim may be rejected if there is a mistake. However,
tribunals now have more power than previously to allow a mistake
in the number if a judge thinks it would not be in the interests of
justice to reject the claim.111 This is different from the position if the
number is left out altogether, in which case the claim must be
rejected (see above).
Another possibility is that the claimant has named two respondents
on the ET1, but has only obtained one certificate, and that certificate
only names one respondent.112 In that case, the tribunal will reject the
claim as against the respondent without the certificate.
A tribunal may also reject a claim if the name of the claimant or
respondent on the ACAS certificate is different from their name on
the tribunal form. However, a judge can decide that it would not be
in the interests of justice to reject the claim where the claimant made
an error in relation to a name or address.113 Before 8 October 2020,
a judge could only overlook ‘minor’ errors, but the word ‘minor’ has
now been removed from the rules.
All the circumstances are likely to be relevant when considering if
it is in the interests of justice to reject a claim because of such an
error. The most important factors are likely to be whether the
claimant was aiming at the same entity and whether in practice,
ACAS was able to get in touch with the claimant’s employer. Other
relevant factors might be whether the claimant had been given clear

20.84

20.85

documents during his or her employment with the employer’s name,
whether there was reason for confusion eg because of different
trading names or multiple companies in a group, and whether the
claimant was represented at the time of contacting ACAS. Simple
spelling mistakes or typos are very unlikely to be a problem. If the
claimant gave ACAS the name of an individual instead of the
employer, it may depend on the individual’s role in the organisation,
whether ACAS made contact with the organisation, and whether the
claimant was trying to refer to the employer.
Relying on a judge to overlook an error is risky. Every effort
should be made to give ACAS the correct name in the first place. If
the problem is that the claimant is unsure as to who is the correct
employer or who else should be named as a respondent, it is usually
safest to notify ACAS under each possible name.
If the tribunal does reject the claim for any of these reasons, the
claimant can apply for reconsideration in the usual way. S/he could
try to argue, if applicable, that the decision to reject was wrong
because it was not in the interests of justice to do so. Or s/he could
remedy the defect by entering EC immediately with the correct name,
obtaining a certificate and presenting the tribunal claim again. The
problem with the latter route is that the date of presentation of the
claim will be taken as the date when the claim is presented afresh,
which may well cause time limit problems. In a case where one
claim is accepted because there is a certificate and it is only a claim
against a second respondent which is rejected, a further option is to
ask the tribunal to allow an amendment of the claim to add the
second respondent back in. The EC process does not apply to an
amendment and the usual considerations regarding whether an
amendment is allowed would apply, taking into account the reasons
why the claimant failed to get a certificate in the first place for the
second respondent and any adverse effect on the latter as a result of
losing the opportunity for EC, although bearing in mind that there is
no obligation on the claimant to negotiate anyway.114

The employer’s response (ET3)

20.86

20.87

20.88

The employer must send the tribunal his/her response115 to the claim
on an approved (‘prescribed’) response form (usually known as an
ET3). The employer must give his/her full name and address and
state whether s/he intends to resist any part of the claim.116 In an
unfair dismissal case, the employer will have to prove the reason for
dismissal and that it was one of the potentially fair reasons.117 The
ET3 should therefore provide an indication as to what the
employer’s reason was. If the employer does not give sufficient
details, so that the claimant does not fully understand what the
employer’s defence is, a letter should be written to the ET pointing
this out and requesting additional information.
Employers must present their response to the ET within 28 days of
the date they were sent a copy of the claim.118 The response will be
rejected if it is received outside the time limit (or any extension of
time granted within the time limit) unless an application for an
extension of time has already been made or the response is
accompanied by such an application.119 An employer whose
response has been rejected for these reasons or for not supplying the
minimum required information can apply within 14 days for a
reconsideration of the decision, explaining why the rejection was
wrong or rectifying the notified defect.120 The judge will decide the
application on the papers unless the employer has requested a
hearing (except if the judge has decided to allow the application
anyway).
Where the employer applies for an extension of time to submit the
ET3, s/he must give the reasons and, if the time limit has already
passed, s/he must attach a draft ET3 or explain why it is not possible
to do so. The application must be copied to the claimant, who will
have seven days to write in with any objections to the time
extension.121 An employment judge can decide on the basis of the
papers, rather than holding a hearing, whether to allow the late ET3.
The relevant considerations include whether there has been an
explanation for the delay, the quality of any explanation, the strength
of the employer’s defence to the claim and the prejudice to each side
if the ET allows or refuses an extension.122

20.89

20.90

20.91

20.92

Time limits on submitting an ET3 are not as strict as time limits
for submitting an ET1. There is a reason for this. The ET1 time limits
come from the original statutory rights and are a matter of the ET’s
jurisdiction. The ET3 time limits are purely a matter of procedure.
Tribunals often do give permission for ET3s to be submitted one or
two weeks’ late if the employer makes a request before the time limit
is up and has a good reason for needing more time, eg because
detailed information has to be gathered to answer a long and detailed
ET1, or because the relevant manager who knows about the case is
on holiday.
If no ET3 is received in time or allowed out of time, an
employment judge will issue a judgment if it is possible to do so
properly on the available material, essentially the ET1 plus any extra
documents which the judge might ask for. This is known as a ‘rule
21’ judgment (under the previous slightly different rules, it was
known as a default judgment). The judge must be satisfied on the
papers and taking what the claimant says as undisputed fact, that the
necessary factual elements exist to make out the legal claim.123 If not,
a hearing will be fixed. The respondent will be entitled to notice of
any hearings and decisions, but unless an extension of time is
granted, will only be allowed to participate in any hearing to the
extent allowed by the judge.124 There is presidential guidance for
England and Wales on rule 21 judgments.125
It is fairly ominous if there is no ET3, or if an attempted ET3 is
not accepted by the tribunal and the employer does not bother to
apply for a reconsideration. This tends to suggest that the employer
has no intention of paying any award and may well be on the way to
insolvency.
If a response is submitted and accepted, the ET sends a copy on to
the claimant. It is then that the further preparatory stages can take
place. All the information in the ET3 should be checked with the
claimant, listing what points are not accepted. Check all the small
details on the ET3 form as well as the grounds on which the
employer intends to resist the claim. If the employer’s reasons for

justifying the dismissal are vague or unclear, it may be wise to ask
for additional information (see para 20.116 onwards).

Contract claims against the claimant
20.93

20.94

As explained in para 4.26, in certain circumstances, an employee
whose employment has terminated can bring a contract claim in an
ET, eg for notice pay. If s/he does so, it is possible that the employer
will bring his/her own contract claim against the employee. This
used to be called a ‘counterclaim’ but strictly-speaking that is not a
legally accurate description of the position, and the 2013 rules just
refer to ‘an employer’s contract claim’. The subject of the
employer’s contract claim does not need to relate in any way to the
content of the employee’s contract claim. It is important to bear in
mind that the employer’s contract claim has a life of its own. If the
claimant later withdraws or settles his/her own contract claim, the
employer’s contract claim may continue (unless that is also
withdrawn or settled).
Any contract claim made by the employer must be part of the
employer’s response to the claimant’s ET1 containing a contract
claim. There is a specific section 6 on the ET3 if the employer is
making such a claim. The tribunal will notify the claimant that there
is an employer’s contract claim when sending the ET3 to him/her.
The claimant must in turn submit a response to the employer’s
contract claim within 28 days.126

Case management
Overview
20.95

Case management is concerned with preparing the case for the
hearing, eg collecting information and documents from the other side
and fixing hearing dates.127 These steps are sometimes known as
interim or interlocutory matters. In non-discrimination cases, this
preparation is usually dealt with in correspondence directly between
each side and if necessary, the ET is asked for an order if agreement
cannot be reached. The parties are asked on the claim and response

20.96

20.97

20.98

forms to indicate their preferred method of communication. Email is
now the most popular method, especially given disruption to office
space caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, although some documents
cannot be sent electronically. Parties should check their emails every
day if they want to communicate this way, as they are sometimes
required to comment on matters, respond to orders or attend
preliminary hearings on very short notice.
In discrimination cases or other cases which are particularly large
or complex, the ET usually holds one or more preliminary hearings,
where these matters are dealt with orally in discussion with an
employment judge.128 Some regions hold preliminary hearings on the
telephone where the only matters to deal with relate to case
management. Since the Covid pandemic, the vast majority of case
management preliminary hearings have been conducted by telephone
or video (see paras 20.228–20.234 regarding remote hearings
generally).
Once the ET1 and ET3 are submitted, generally no further special
forms or formats are used by the parties. Any correspondence with
the other side or the ET simply takes the form of an ordinary letter or
email. Although no legalistic formats are required, there are certain
conventions which tend to be followed. The ET does not want to get
into lengthy correspondence to and fro with the claimant. It is
important to remember that the case is not argued on paper. The
claimant definitely does not, for example, provide a written response
to the ET3 or to any additional information provided by the
employer. The opportunity to put his/her own account of events is
shortly before the hearing, when s/he writes his/her witness
statement (see para 20.186). In the meantime s/he is simply gathering
information from the employer by means of answers to written
questions (called ‘additional information’) and documents, and s/he
is providing information if requested by the employer. Any
correspondence between a party and the ET will be copied to the
other party (apart from initial requests for a witness order).
The ET has general case management powers. In England and
Wales, ETs have traditionally been more proactive than in Scotland.

20.99

An ET can make orders at any stage in the proceedings, either on
paper or at a preliminary or other hearing. An order can be made
either because one of the parties has applied or on the tribunal’s own
initiative.129 Where an order is made based on the paperwork and in
the absence of the parties, the parties will have the opportunity to
object (see para 20.128 onwards). It is common for the ET to make
orders regarding the provision of additional information, written
answers, witness statements and documents.130
Legal officers have now been appointed to carry out certain case
management functions which previously only employment judges.
Parties are able to apply within 14 days of any decision for it to be
considered afresh by an employment judge.131

Initial consideration of the claim and response forms
20.100 The 2013 rules specifically require tribunals to consider the file as

soon as possible after acceptance of the ET3 with a view to
confirming there are arguable complaints and defences within the
tribunal’s jurisdiction and giving case management orders.132 If an
employment judge thinks the ET has no jurisdiction to consider all or
part of a claim or that the claim has no reasonable prospects of
success, the tribunal will write to the parties setting out the judge’s
view and reasons for it, and ordering that the claim or part claim
will be dismissed on a particular date unless the claimant has
supplied a written explanation before that date as to why it should
not be dismissed.133 For example, the letter might say that the judge
is thinking of striking out an unfair dismissal claim because the
employee does not appear to have two years’ continuous service. It
is essential that the claimant takes such a letter seriously and
responds within the time limit set, addressing the particular reasons
which the judge has given. If the claimant does not send in a written
explanation by that date, the claim will automatically be dismissed
and the parties will be notified. If the claimant does send in written
comments by the relevant date, a judge will read them and either
decide on the paperwork whether to allow the claim, or will fix a

hearing with the claimant to discuss the matter. The employer can
attend and participate if s/he wants.
20.101
There are equivalent rules if a judge thinks the response or part of
it has no reasonable prospect of success.134 If the whole response is
dismissed, the consequences will be as if no ET3 was ever
presented (see para 20.90). It is relatively unusual for the tribunal to
write this kind of letter to the parties. Therefore, if the claimant
receives such a letter, s/he should realise it means his/her position
looks very weak on paper. It is an important reason why the claimant
should try to get good advice at the outset as to his/her chances of
success and to get assistance in writing the ET1 in a way which
highlights a sensible legal and evidential basis for his/her claim.
20.102
As an alternative to this specific initial consideration process, an
employment judge who has doubts about the strength of all or part of
a claim, rather than ask the claimant for any written comments, may
go straight to a preliminary hearing at which it will be decided
whether to strike out the claim for having no reasonable prospects of
success or to order a costs deposit on grounds of having little
reasonable prospects of success. This type of hearing has become
increasingly common, mainly for cases involving allegations of
whistleblowing or discrimination without any obvious evidential
foundation. The grounds and procedure for striking out in this way
are discussed further at paras 20.111 and 20.165 onwards and for
deposit orders at para 20.167 onwards. The important point to
remember is that if the tribunal arranges this kind of preliminary
hearing, the case on the ET1 probably looks very weak indeed. This
is either because the claimant has a good case but the ET1 has been
written badly, or because the claimant has no evidence to support
his/her gut feeling that s/he has been treated unlawfully. Even if the
claimant escapes without a strike out or deposit, it does not mean the
claim is strong and it does not mean there is no risk of having costs
awarded against him/her if s/he ultimately loses. On the contrary.
The claimant should listen very carefully to what the judge says
because if s/he has escaped a strike out or deposit warning by the

skin of his/her teeth, s/he could still end up paying the employer a lot
of money by way of costs at the end of the day.
20.103
One other possibility, whether or not the claimant receives an
initial consideration letter or is asked to attend this kind of
preliminary hearing, is that it is not the whole claim which looks
weak, but only parts of it. The claimant may have one or two
reasonable claims buried among a mass of peripheral complaints.
Again, this is particularly common in whistleblowing or
discrimination claims where there is a temptation to list a large
number of incidents as unlawful detriments instead of keeping them
in the background and concentrating on only a few major incidents
which have a financial value and the best chance of being proved.

Likely stages of case preparation
20.104 If none of the above difficulties arise, the usual preparation stages

can be summarised as follows (more details will be set out later in
this chapter):135
•

In England and Wales, either with the acknowledgment of claim form or when the ET3 is
sent to the claimant, a tribunal is likely to send out a letter with a table setting out the
standard case management orders.136 Typically this will order the following steps to be
taken on certain dates or within a certain number of weeks:
-

that the claimant sends the employer a schedule of loss;

-

mutual disclosure of documents;

-

agreement of a trial bundle;

-

exchange of witness statements.

Sometimes this is referred to as a ‘case management timetable’ or ‘case management
directions’. A hearing date may also be notified at this stage. Where claims are more
complicated, eg a whistleblowing or discrimination claim, the tribunal may instead notify the
parties of a preliminary hearing to deal with case management.
•

Promptly following receipt of the ET3, the claimant should write to the employer asking for
any additional information or written answers which s/he needs. In a straightforward unfair
dismissal claim where the employer has provided a detailed ET3, this may not be
necessary.

•

After disclosure of documents on the date set in the tribunal’s case management timetable,
if the claimant believes the employer has omitted important documents which are in the
employer’s possession, s/he should immediately write to the employer asking for these to
be provided within a certain timescale, normally 14 days.137

•

If the employer does not supply the requested information and documents, the claimant
should write to the ET, explaining this and asking for an order. This letter is copied to the
employer together with a letter informing the employer that s/he must send any objections
to the tribunal as soon as possible.

•

The ET may send the employer an order to supply the additional information or documents
by a certain date, usually in 14 days’ time. A copy of the order is sent to the claimant.
Alternatively, the ET may refuse to make an order or cut down the information requested.

•

If the order is not complied with, the ET can be asked to make an order for costs or to
strike out all or part of the employer’s ET3 or to debar the employer from defending
altogether. Striking out is unusual on this ground, but it can happen where there has been a
continual failure to comply with orders.138

•

Some orders for additional information or documents warn the employer that ‘unless’ the
order is complied with on time, the ET3 will automatically be struck out.139 If the original
order did not contain this warning, an ET cannot strike out without first writing to the
employer, inviting him/her to give reasons why s/he should not be struck out.140 The
employer then tends to supply the ordered information.

•

The employer can ask the tribunal to vary or set aside the original order for documents etc,
especially if s/he had no chance to comment before the order was made.141 The
application must be copied to the claimant, who must be notified of his/her right to
object.142

•

Each of the above steps regarding disclosure and additional information can happen in
reverse if the employer wants to ask the claimant for more information.

•

After disclosure of documents, one of the parties has to put the most important documents
together into a file or ‘trial bundle’ (in Scotland, known as a bundle or inventory of
‘productions’) which will be used at the final hearing. A copy must be supplied to the other
party on the ordered date and extra copies brought to the tribunal on the day of the hearing.

•

Witness statements must then be exchanged on the date ordered.

•

In Scotland, there is less likely to be a standard set of case management orders from the
tribunal. This makes it particularly important that the claimant takes the initiative on
receiving the ET3 and writes to the employer asking for disclosure of all relevant
documents, whether helpful to the employer’s case or not, as well as any required

additional information and written answers. Witness statements are unlikely to be used
unless specifically agreed.

Timescales in any orders against the claimant should be taken
extremely seriously, as ETs have been known to order costs against
claimants who have failed to comply or even to strike them out for
continuous failure. It is no defence that the representative is
inexperienced or, for example, a very busy trade union official.
20.105
Although the ET is likely to have sent out standard case
management orders at an early stage, it is recommended that, on
receiving the ET3, the adviser should write to the employer asking
for any additional information which s/he requires. Do not delay in
writing this first letter. It is important to allow enough time to
prepare the case. Many steps need to be taken after getting documents
and information from the employer, including discussing these with
the claimant, writing witness statements and agreeing a trial bundle.
Some ETs fix hearing dates very quickly and the claimant may not
have left enough time to gather the information needed. Although the
employer should always be asked for the information voluntarily
first, there is a risk in delaying going for an order if the information
is not supplied within, say, 14 days. If there is a real indication that
the information is coming shortly, then it is worth waiting, because
there is always the fear that the ET will refuse to order some of the
requested information. On the other hand, there is a risk of getting
strung along by the employer for a long period, at the end of which
no information is volunteered and time has run out to get an order.
20.106
Good case preparation is vitally important to the successful
outcome of a tribunal case. The claimant must make sure s/he does
get all relevant documents from the employer, because documents
often contain the most revealing evidence. S/he must ensure s/he
understands the employer’s defence well in advance of exchange of
witness statements, so that s/he can address any relevant points in
his/her witness statement. S/he needs to know what is said about the
reason for dismissal and the procedural steps which were followed.
S/he needs to make sure s/he gets the employer’s witness statements
in enough time to read them closely and prepare cross-examination

for the hearing. Efficient case preparation may also put pressure on
an employer which leads to a good settlement. If the claimant keeps
to all the time limits and chases the employer regarding any delays,
settlement may come to be seen by the employer as an attractive
option.
20.107
Having said that, case preparation can become very
argumentative, with one or both parties not sticking to time limits and
the other party complaining to the tribunal. This is very stressful and
can lead to a downward spiral ending in costs or even strike out. In
some circumstances, it may be useful to remind the employer that the
‘overriding objective’ now says parties must co-operate with each
other (see para 20.41). Both sides need to apply common sense. If
the claimant knows s/he cannot meet a deadline for a good reason, it
is a good idea to ask the employer in advance for a short extension of
time and explain why. Then s/he must keep to the new date.
Similarly, if the employer asks for a short extension, it usually pays
off to agree, as long as it does not cause any major problems by
getting too near to the date of the final hearing. There is nothing
unusual or suspicious about small delays in the case management
timetable. If agreement cannot be reached, ask the tribunal well in
advance for a time extension, explaining why. Do not get into the
habit of asking for extra time at every stage. That creates a bad
impression, and the tribunal will start saying no.
20.108
The tribunal’s main focus will be on ensuring that the case is well
prepared in good time for the final hearing. It will not want to get
involved in squabbles between the parties and mutual recriminations
about non-compliance with orders. Although it can be frustrating, it
will rarely help the claimant win his/her case to point out that the
employer has been obstructive in case preparation. The tribunal will
be primarily concerned with whether there can be a fair hearing on
the appointed day. The key issue is usually whether each party has
had sufficient time – which may not mean a great deal of time – to
read each other’s documents and witness statements and find his/her
way around the trial bundle.

It is helpful to understand how much discretion and flexibility
tribunals have under the 2013 rules. The idea is that, rather than get
bogged down in rigid rules restricting what they can do, tribunals are
free to focus on the realities of fair case preparation. The aim is to
get both parties to a fair hearing where they are in a position to argue
their case properly. The tribunal will not be happy if one party’s
failure to abide by case management orders costs the other party
unnecessary time and money.
20.110
These are some of the key generic rules in the ET Regs 2013:
20.109

•

Sch 1 r29: The tribunal can make case management orders and send these to the parties at
any stage, on its own initiative or at the request of a party. It can also vary or set aside
earlier case management orders where that is ‘necessary in the interests of justice’,
especially where an affected party had no chance to comment before the order was made.
Variation of an order will only be ‘in the interests of justice’ if there has been a material
change in circumstances since the order was made or the order was based on misleading
facts or for other exceptional reasons.143 The reason for this restriction is to give parties
some certainty during case preparation, by preventing matters being endlessly reopened.

•

Sch 1 r30: Either party can apply for a case management order in writing or at a hearing. If
applying in writing, the party must tell the other party to send any objections to the tribunal
as soon as possible. If the claimant is notified of an application by the employer, s/he should
therefore ensure s/he writes to the tribunal with any objection by return and marked
‘urgent’ as the tribunal may not wait very long before deciding the matter.

•

Sch 1 r92: Whenever a party sends any communication to a tribunal (except for an
application for a witness order), s/he must send a copy to the other party and let the
tribunal know this has happened, eg by writing ‘cc’ at the foot of the letter to the tribunal or
copying the other side into an email. The tribunal can decide no such notification is
necessary in the interests of justice.

•

Sch 1 r70: As mentioned above, rule 29 allows case management orders to be varied in
certain circumstances. Rule 70 contains a slightly more formal process for judgments to be
‘reconsidered’.144 The demarcation between orders and judgments is not always clear, but
essentially a judgment is a decision which makes the final decision regarding liability,
remedy or costs, and a ‘case management order’ is any other decision relating to the
conduct of the proceedings.145 A decision to strike out all or part of a claim or response is
a ‘judgment’.

•

Sch 1 r5: The tribunal can extend or shorten any time limit, including retrospectively.

•

Sch 1 r6: Any failure to comply with a tribunal order or procedural rule does not in itself
invalidate the proceedings. The tribunal can react in various ways, eg by varying or waiving
the requirement; by striking out the claim or response; by restricting a party’s participation
in the proceedings; or by awarding costs.

Striking out
20.111 At any time, on its own initiative or on the application of either party,

an ET may strike out all or part of a tribunal claim or response on
grounds that it is scandalous or vexatious or has no reasonable
prospect of success, or that the way the claimant or employer is
conducting the proceedings is scandalous, unreasonable or
vexatious.146 It can also strike out for non-compliance with an order
or because the claim or response is not being actively pursued or
because it is no longer possible to have a fair hearing of the claim or
response. Before striking out, the ET must give the relevant party the
opportunity to give reasons in writing or, if requested, at a hearing,
why the order should not be made.147
20.112
Striking out is a very serious step and should not be taken
lightly.148 It should be rare in whistleblowing or discrimination cases
to strike out on the ground of no reasonable prospect of success, as
these issues are particularly fact-sensitive and dependent on
evidence being heard.149 Where striking out is considered for
procedural abuses, the crucial issue is whether a fair trial is still
possible and whether a lesser sanction may be appropriate.150 A
striking out order is unlikely to be made if it is still possible to have
a fair hearing, eg because by the time the ET threatens to strike out,
the employer finally produces the ordered information and
documents.151 A rare exception occurred in one case where the
employer ignored various interim orders and eventually produced a
lengthy witness statement on the first day of the hearing, having
previously served no witness statements. The EAT agreed that the ET
was entitled to strike out the employer’s defence, because the
employer had gained an unfair advantage by having already seen the
claimant’s witness statements, and also because there was no
guarantee that the claimant’s pro bono representative would still be

available if the hearing was postponed for the claimant to deal with
the unexpected witness statement.152 In general, however, striking a
party out for non-compliance with procedures should only be a last
resort, where a fair hearing is no longer possible; a more appropriate
step in a serious case may be for a tribunal to issue an ‘unless order’
(see next paragraph), which at least acts as a warning to the party of
the consequences of continuing not to co-operate.153
20.113
An ‘unless order’ under ET Regs 2013 Sch 1 r38 is more
draconian than a normal order – it is an order which states that
unless it is complied with, the claim or response (as relevant) will
be struck out on the date of non-compliance without the need for a
hearing or to give notice to the relevant party. This will be an
automatic strike-out without the tribunal exercising its discretion any
further. The tribunal will give the parties written notice that the
strike-out has occurred.
20.114
The ET can be asked to set aside a strike-out arising from an
‘unless order’ if it is in the interests of justice to do so.154 A party
must write to the tribunal within 14 days of the date the notice of
strike-out was sent. The ET may make a decision on paper unless the
party requests a hearing. If a claim or response is struck out in the
normal way, ie not as a result of an ‘unless order’, the tribunal can
be asked to reconsider under rule 70 (assuming a strike out is a
judgment, but if not, to vary the order under rule 29).
20.115
When the tribunal decides whether to overturn the striking-out, the
sort of factors which are relevant are the reason for the procedural
failure, and in particular: whether it is deliberate; the seriousness of
the procedural failure; the prejudice to the other party; and whether a
fair trial remains possible.155 It will be more difficult to overturn a
striking out which followed an ‘unless order’, because the party was
put squarely on notice of the importance of complying with the order.
However, this is just one factor.156

Requesting additional information and written answers
20.116 As explained below, it is important to get all relevant and useful

documents which are in the employer’s possession. If the ET3 is

vague or there is some unknown information which is not contained
in documents, the claimant can ask written questions and obtain
written answers. This is often referred to as asking for ‘additional
information’.157
20.117
Where the employer asks that the claimant give more detail of
what s/he is claiming, this is often referred to as giving ‘particulars’
or ‘particularising’ the claim (‘specification’ in Scotland). Equally,
employers might be asked to ‘particularise’ their response where
their ET3 is very vague. This jargon dates back to a time when
asking a party to spell out parts of his/her claim or response was
called ‘requesting further and better particulars’.
20.118
One important function of the claimant seeking additional
information is to make sure s/he understands the employer’s defence
and can prepare to answer it. The claimant should ask for
clarification of vague statements in the ET3, eg if the employer says
in the ET3: ‘We warned the claimant on numerous occasions as to
her conduct at work’, a relevant request for information would be:
‘Please state in respect of each warning the date when the claimant
was warned, by whom, and the nature of the warning given’.
20.119
As well as questions relating to matters set out by the employer in
the ET3, the claimant can also ask questions to clarify any issue
likely to arise for determination or to ascertain information relevant
to the claim. For example, where the claimant was dismissed for
fighting at work, s/he could ask: ‘What action was taken against the
other person involved in the fight?’158
20.120
The claimant should not ask too many detailed questions. The aim
is not to conduct the whole case on paper. Cross-examination is
usually reserved for the full ET hearing. It is best just to ask three or
four very important questions (if any). If the employer refuses to
answer on the ground that ‘You are not entitled to this because you
have asked for evidence about matters not contained in the ET3’, a
good reply (if applicable) would be that the questions are relevant to
the issues arising for determination and will save time at the hearing
if established in advance.

If the employer will not answer the questions voluntarily, the
claimant needs to ask the tribunal for an order under Sch 1 r30.159 As
already stated, an ET may be reluctant to order too much additional
information if it is unnecessary at this stage of case preparation and
would be expensive or time-consuming for the employer to answer.
So the temptation to ask for too much should be avoided unless it is
necessary because of the vagueness of the ET3.
20.122
All the above points will apply in reverse if the employer asks the
claimant for additional information regarding the ET1. If the ET1 is
well written and explains the basis for the claim, especially in the
case of an ordinary unfair dismissal claim, it should not be necessary
to provide extra detail. However, in a more complex case, eg for
automatic unfair dismissal based on whistleblowing, the claimant
may not have clearly identified when s/he says s/he blew the whistle
or to whom. It is a natural reaction to resist giving extra information
unless ordered to do so by the tribunal. Sometimes, this is because of
a concern that it would give too much away to the employer before
the employer has committed him/herself to an account of events
which s/he may not be able to prove. On the other hand, the questions
may be fair enough and be likely to be ordered by the tribunal, in
which case it is sensible to prepare the answers in any event, in case
an order is made that they be supplied at short notice.
20.121

Disclosure
20.123 Disclosure is the method by which the claimant can find out about

and obtain documents which are in the employer’s possession. The
old-fashioned legal word for this is ‘discovery’. In Scotland, it is
called ‘recovery’. Strictly speaking, an order for disclosure only
obliges the employer to produce a list of the requested documents.
This is combined with an order for inspection, which allows the
documents to be seen and copies taken at the claimant’s expense. In
practice, the ET usually simply asks the employer to send a list and
copies to the claimant and to allow inspection of the originals if
requested. This is useful because the employer tends not to ask for
copying costs in this situation and s/he can always be asked to bring

the originals to the hearing. If there is any suspicion at all about
whether documents are genuine or have been manipulated, the
originals should be inspected at this stage. This will involve a visit
to the offices of the employer or employer’s representative. Because
so much communication has occurred by email as a result of the
pandemic, it has become common for employers to provide the
documents electronically. If the claimant finds it difficult to look at
documents on a computer screen, s/he should ask for hard copies.
20.124
All courts tend to prefer documents to witnesses and the ET is no
exception. This is particularly true of contemporaneous documents.
Cases are often won or lost on the strength of the documents before
the ET, and it is essential that all relevant documents are available at
the hearing. The practice regarding disclosure has become more
formal than it used to be. An ET can order such disclosure and
inspection as might be granted by a county court, or, in Scotland, by a
sheriff.160 In England and Wales, this means as set out by Part 31 of
the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) 1998.161 The ET’s standard case
management timetable in England and Wales commonly states
something like this:
By (date) the claimant and the respondent shall send each other a list of any documents
that they wish to refer to at the hearing or which are relevant to the case. They shall send
each other a copy of any of these documents if requested to do so.162

It may be worth waiting for the date set in the tribunal’s original case
management timetable to see what the employer volunteers, but an
adviser should specifically ask the employer for any important
additional documents which are not disclosed and which s/he
believes the employer has. In Scotland, a party’s duty is to disclose
the documents on which s/he intends to rely 14 days before the
hearing.163 This is very late if there is going to be any dispute. If the
claimant wants to prepare sooner and be sure s/he sees all the
documents in the employer’s possession (not just those which the
employer wants to use), s/he needs to ask specifically at an earlier
stage, ideally on receiving the ET3.

The ET may be more ready to order disclosure than additional
information, although it will not allow wide-ranging and speculative
requests. The documents must be relevant and must also be necessary
for the fair disposal of the case. A document is relevant if it helps
prove the claimant’s case or damages the employer’s case.164 These
principles apply even if the documents are confidential, although a
tribunal may then be willing to focus on what is really necessary, eg
by ordering partial disclosure or allowing certain information to be
‘redacted’ (blacked out).165
20.126
In unfair dismissal cases, it is usually relevant to seek disclosure
of all contractual documents or statements of terms and conditions
and any personnel file and written warnings relied on. If the claimant
has a long history of grievances, disputes and disciplinary action, it
may be unwise to ask for the whole personnel file, and it is better
just to specify documents which are relevant to the current claim.
The employer should disclose relevant electronic documents,
including emails, word-processed documents and databases, which
may be stored on servers and back-up systems and even ‘deleted’.
The claimant needs to agree with the employer in what form such
documents should be disclosed (printed out, via email, etc).166 If
tampering is suspected of documents which have been created on
computer,
ask for
these
to
be
emailed
to
the
claimant’s/representative’s office. The dates that documents were
generated can often be checked electronically. Finally, it is always a
good idea to request: ‘any other documents in the employer’s
possession, power or control which are relevant to the case, whether
helpful to the employer or not’. The ET will usually order this
category of documents and it prevents the employer holding back
useful documents or surprising the claimant with unseen documents
on the day of the hearing. Letters between the parties or to ACAS
concerning possible settlement of the claim must not be produced on
disclosure or put before the ET unless each party expressly
agrees.167 See paras 9.20–9.25 for when documents are ‘privileged’
and therefore not shown to the other side.
20.125

20.127

Under the usual case management timetable in England and Wales,
a claimant is also ordered to disclose relevant documents. Normally
s/he has nothing which the employer does not also have, but tribunals
expect the claimant to disclose correspondence relating to efforts to
find a new job (‘mitigation’). This can be updated just before the
hearing by inclusion in the trial bundle. Especially in discrimination
cases, employees sometimes have diaries which they wrote at the
time. A diary probably has to be disclosed, but check whether it
contains ‘privileged’ information (eg notes of legal advice) and
whether it was written at the time or only after the case started as an
aide-mémoire. Where there are tape recordings, text messages or
electronic documents, consider whether these need to be produced in
the tribunal in their original form and if so, how. Also check whether
transcripts are necessary and who will prepare and pay for them.168

Applying for an order
20.128 If the employer will not voluntarily supply the requested documents

and information or takes too long in doing so, it is necessary to apply
for an order. Do not delay in applying. If the application is made too
close to the hearing, an order is unlikely to be made, either because
of slow ET administration, or because it is decided to leave matters
to the hearing date. The procedure is set out in ET Regs 2013 Sch 1
r30. To apply for an order, the claimant must write to the ET, setting
out what s/he wants by way of additional information, documents,
etc. S/he should send a copy of the original request to the employer
and indicate the employer’s response. Unless it is obvious, it may be
useful to explain very briefly why the questions are relevant and how
they fit with the ‘overriding objective’ (see para 20.39). Make the
letter to the tribunal short and clear, and number each request. Give
the tribunal all the necessary information in one letter. Do not expect
the tribunal to start cross-referring numerous documents in order to
work out what is being asked for.
20.129
At the same time as writing to the ET, the claimant must send the
employer a copy of the letter to the tribunal. The letter to the
employer must state that any objection to the application must be sent

to the ET as soon as possible.169 The claimant must confirm in
writing to the ET that this requirement has been complied with. The
simplest way to do this is for the claimant to write ‘cc (the
respondent)’ at the foot of the letter to the ET. The ET may not wait
very long for the employer to send in an objection if time is pressing.
Indeed, the ET has power to decide no such notification was
necessary in the interests of justice.
20.130
The order will usually be considered by the ET on the paperwork,
although if a preliminary hearing is already scheduled, the request
may well be considered then.
20.131
The request for an order will be considered by an employment
judge. It is not unusual for a request to be refused or reduced. This
can be a real concern because it is hard to challenge. If the document
or information is important, the ET can be asked to change its mind
regarding its decision to refuse an order on grounds that it is
necessary in the interests of justice.170 It is best to do this as soon as
possible and put forward some additional arguments. The ET cannot
change an earlier decision which has affected the parties’
preparation of their cases unless there has been a material change in
circumstances.171 This is to ensure that procedural decisions are not
endlessly reopened by the parties.
20.132
If an order is made, the employer can ask the ET to withdraw or
vary it, especially if s/he had no reasonable opportunity to make
comments in advance.172 Whether it is the claimant or the employer
who asks the tribunal to change its mind, the application should be
sent to the other side under Sch 1 r30.173 If the tribunal refuses to
withdraw the order and the employer fails to comply with it, the
claimant should write informing the tribunal of this (unless s/he has
agreed a small time extension with the employer).174 The tribunal can
then be asked to strike out the employer or to issue an ‘unless order’
or to award costs.
20.133
In procedural terms, the ET cannot be asked formally to
‘reconsider’175 a case management order or refusal to make an order,
but as already explained, it can simply be asked to change its mind
under Sch 1 r29 if appropriate. It is also possible to appeal to the

EAT if the ET will not change its mind, but only if there is an error of
law or perversity and the claimant’s case is clearly prejudiced.
Appeals concerning orders, or refused orders, for documents or
additional information are very rare and would not normally be
embarked upon unless the matter was of central importance.
20.134
The same procedure applies in reverse if it is the employer who
wants an order against the claimant.

Orders against third parties
20.135 The ET has power to order a third party to disclose documents or
provide additional information.176 For example, an employment

agency could be ordered to provide documents relating to the
wording of a job advertisement if that was not in the employer’s
possession.

Witness orders
20.136 A claimant can apply for a witness order requiring the attendance of
any person as a witness177 if that person can give relevant evidence

which is necessary (because it is disputed) and s/he will not attend
voluntarily.178 A witness can also be ordered to produce documents.
This is useful where documents are held by someone other than the
employer, who will not provide copies voluntarily. A request for an
order should be sent to the ET in good time for the hearing, setting
out the name and home or work address of the witness. It should very
briefly summarise why the evidence is relevant and necessary and
state that the witness is not prepared to attend the hearing
voluntarily.179 Unlike requests for case management orders, the letter
sent to the ET asking for a witness statement is not routinely copied
to the employer, though in exceptional circumstances the ET can ask
the employer’s views.180 If the ET issues a witness order, it will
send it direct to the witness, and must notify each side that an order
has been made and the name of the witness. A witness who fails to
attend can be fined up to £1,000 unless the witness successfully
applies to the ET before the hearing for the order to be set aside.

20.137

An order should be obtained only if the witness is co-operative,
but does not want to attend without an order (usually to protect the
witness, so that the witness can tell his/her employer that s/he is not
attending the hearing voluntarily, or because s/he is in a new job and
cannot get the time off). A witness who does not want to attend at all,
or who is forced to do so, is almost invariably a bad witness. Apart
from anything else, it will be hard to get a statement from an
unwilling witness in advance of the hearing, so there is no certainty
as to what s/he will say. Nor is it a good idea for the claimant to call
an unhelpful management witness simply in order to cross-examine
him/her. First of all, it is a general rule of evidence that a party
cannot cross-examine his/her own witness on the basis that the
witness is not telling the truth, unless the tribunal gives the party
permission to treat the witness as ‘hostile’. This has a technical
meaning. It does not mean simply unfriendly, but essentially that the
witness is deliberately not telling the truth in order to damage the
party’s case. The ET may not be bound by such a rule, but it may
well take the same approach. Second, the idea that the claimant can
successfully cross-examine a hostile witness underestimates the
damage that witness’s evidence is likely to do to the claimant’s case
in the first place, and usually overestimates what the claimant is
likely to achieve through cross-examination. Even if a witness is
friendly and willing to come, it is important to think about how
his/her evidence is relevant to the issues in the case, and whether
s/he might say anything which is positively unhelpful when
questioned by the employer. Finally, remember that whether or not a
claimant’s witnesses come voluntarily, a tribunal may order the
claimant to pay their expenses (see para 20.265).

Hearing dates and postponements
20.138 The legal jargon for fixing a hearing date is ‘listing’. In Scotland, the

ET usually consults each side about availability before fixing a
hearing date, although readers should check this is still happening.
The normal practice in England and Wales is for the ET to fix the
date and then send each side a notice of hearing. These days, many

tribunals send out a date for an unfair dismissal hearing at the same
time as acknowledging receipt of the ET1 and copying it to the
employer.181 Each party must receive at least 14 days’ notice of the
full hearing.182 Reasonable notice must be given of any preliminary
hearing, and if it involves any preliminary issues, notice must be at
least 14 days and specify what the preliminary issues are.183
Advisers should read the notice of hearing carefully to check what
kind of hearing is referred to. Sometimes parties fail to realise that
the notice is calling them to a preliminary hearing and not the full
hearing.
20.139
The standard notice is likely to list an unfair dismissal case for a
one-day hearing and invite parties to write in if that is not long
enough. It is important to make the correct time estimate, as it is
highly undesirable for a case to go part-heard (ie to start and not
finish) as the follow-up date may not be for some time afterwards.
Remember that a one-day hearing is not very long when it has to
include time for the tribunal to make its decision. It may only allow
three hours for evidence (ie reading the witness statements, swearing
witnesses in, cross-examination, re-examination and ET questions)
and closing speeches. As a very rough rule of thumb, this is just long
enough for about three very short witnesses including the claimant –
or two witnesses if the witness statements are fairly long.
20.140
The notice of hearing may tell the parties that if they feel the
allocated time is not long enough, they should write in to say so with
their reasons and time estimate within 14 days. If the parties do not
write in with any objection, they should come prepared to fit into the
scheduled time.
20.141
If the date fixed by the tribunal is inconvenient, a postponement
(technically known as an ‘adjournment’) should be requested
immediately. If there is a case management preliminary hearing,
dates are often fixed on the spot, so it is important to come with
diaries and a note of dates to avoid for at least six months ahead for
all witnesses.
20.142
If a date is notified by letter (as opposed to in any preliminary
hearing), it is essential to check immediately with the claimant and

other witnesses that they can attend. It is extremely hard to get a
postponement, even with both parties’ consent, unless eg a key
witness is ill or unavailable or not enough days have been allocated.
The ET may be unsympathetic if it is only a representative who is
unavailable and may suggest that another representative can surely be
found. Small voluntary sector organisations or trade union lay
representatives need to explain the realities of how representation is
organised. Otherwise, there is a risk that the person who suffers will
be the low-paid claimant who cannot afford to pay for alternative
representation and whose case may be harmed by losing the adviser
who has been involved from the beginning. There have been a few
successful appeals against such refusals in discrimination cases
where law centres and other voluntary advice centres have been
involved.184
20.143
Due to the pressures on the ET system to process cases quickly,
there have been a number of cases where postponements have been
found to be unreasonably refused. In certain circumstances,
inadequate and late disclosure of documents by the employer may be
a ground for postponement, but only if it prevents the claimant from
dealing with his/her claim properly.185 A postponement is unlikely
on this ground unless it causes real problems. It is quite common for
a few extra documents to be produced by the employer at the last
minute.
20.144
In a key case under the Human Rights Act 1998,186 the Court of
Appeal said that although a postponement is a discretionary matter
for the tribunal, some postponements must be granted if not to do so
amounts to a denial of justice. To comply with the right to a fair trial
under ECHR Article 6,187 if a party is unable to be present through
no fault of his/her own, s/he must usually be granted a postponement,
however inconvenient to the ET and other side. The onus is on the
party wanting a postponement to prove a genuine need for it. Having
said that, if medical evidence indicates the claimant will never be fit
to attend a hearing, there will come a point where the tribunal can
refuse a postponement or strike the case out because continuing to
wait will be pointless and will eventually make a fair trial

impossible.188 In one case, the EAT overturned an ET’s last-minute
decision to extend the length of a hearing, where it meant that each
side would lose the barrister they had instructed. The EAT said the
tribunal’s worthy consideration of trying to get the case heard
quickly, bearing in mind the dismissal was over a year earlier, had
wrongly taken precedence over a joint well-reasoned application to
postpone made responsibly by represented parties.189
20.145
To improve the chances of persuading an ET to grant a
postponement, or a successful appeal otherwise, it is important
generally to conduct the case promptly and efficiently, to request any
necessary postponement as soon as the problematic date is notified,
to explain fully in a letter to the ET why the postponement is needed
and why it will harm the claimant’s case if the representative is
unavailable. If a holiday was booked prior to the notice of hearing
going out, documentary evidence should be provided of the booking
and holiday dates. It is also helpful to indicate available future dates
as flexibly and imminently as possible.190 The employer needs to be
notified of the application to postpone in the usual way.191 In any
event, it is worth telephoning the employer first to try to get an
agreement for the postponement.
20.146
Where a postponement is requested because the claimant is
medically unfit to attend, it is crucial to get a strong letter from the
claimant’s doctor, specifying exactly the nature of the health
condition concerned, stating that the claimant cannot attend the
hearing and explaining how his/her ill-health prevents him/her from
doing so. It is not enough for the doctor to say that the claimant is
unfit to attend work, since that is a different matter. The letter or
report should not use vague words like ‘stress’ and ‘anxiety’, but
should be clear about symptoms, their causes and severity.192 It is
also useful if the doctor adds information derived from his/her own
observations as opposed to apparently repeating only what the
claimant has told him/her. If possible, the doctor should give some
indication of the claimant’s prognosis and when s/he will be fit to
attend. Doctors often do not realise the importance of addressing
specific issues in their letter. It is essential to explain to them exactly

what is needed and why. If the ET has doubts, it can ask for further
medical evidence. However, it is absurd to criticise a party for not
attending the hearing to give evidence of his/her condition when a
doctor has advised him/her on medical grounds not to attend.193
20.147
Where possible, it is advisable to make any postponement request
well in advance of the hearing. Once the hearing date is imminent,
the ET clerks should be chased to ensure the application is put in
front of a decision-maker as soon as possible. Do not assume that
marking an email ‘urgent’ will suffice. If the request is left too late, it
is more likely that the ET will defer the decision to the tribunal on
the day. This is problematic because everyone must come ready to go
ahead and costs can be wasted if the postponement is agreed. It also
makes it less likely that the request will be granted. The ET has a
discretion to order that the claimant pay the costs of the respondent if
caused by the postponement.194 Also see the special rules where a
postponement request is made less than seven days before the
hearing is due to start (para 20.149).
20.148
If the adviser knows in advance of any notice of hearing that there
will be problems with certain dates, s/he should write and inform the
ET before the dates are set.
20.149
There are particular difficulties in getting a postponement where
the application to postpone is made less than seven days before the
hearing, or where two or more postponements have been granted in
the same proceedings on an application by the same party and that
party applies for a further postponement.195 In either of those
situations, the tribunal may only order a postponement if:
a)

all other parties consent to the postponement and either it is practicable and appropriate
for the purposes of giving the parties the opportunity to resolve their disputes by
agreement, or it is otherwise in accordance with the overriding objective; or

b)

the application was necessitated by an act or omission of another party or the tribunal; or

c)

there are exceptional circumstances.

The ET will give reasons, though these may be very brief, for
agreeing or refusing a postponement request where this is a disputed

matter.196 Before applying for a postponement, it will be useful to
read the relevant Presidential Guidance.197

Preliminary hearings – overview
20.150 Occasionally the tribunal may arrange a preliminary hearing. There

are two types of preliminary hearing. The most common type simply
deals with case management, ie the steps needed to get the case
ready for hearing. The other type is to decide preliminary issues such
as whether the claim was brought in time or whether someone
bringing an unfair dismissal claim was an ‘employee’ as opposed to
self-employed. For most routine unfair dismissal claims, preliminary
hearings of either kind will be unusual.
20.151
The 2013 rules state that a preliminary hearing can be fixed for the
tribunal to do one or more of the following:198
a)

conduct a preliminary consideration of the claim with the parties and make case
management orders;199

b)

decide any preliminary issue, eg whether the unfair dismissal claim was started within the
time limits or whether the claimant was an employee or had two years’ service;200

c)

consider whether the claim or response should be struck out under Sch 1 r37;201

d)

make a deposit order;202

e)

explore the possibility of settlement or alternative dispute resolution including judicial
mediation.

20.152 The letter notifying the preliminary hearing will set out what will be

covered. The hearing will be held in private, ie without access to the
press or public, except for any part of the hearing involving issues in
category b) or c). If there are such issues, the tribunal has power to
direct that the whole hearing is held in public.203
20.153
Category e) is there to encourage parties to settle their disputes
without going to a final hearing. It does not mean that the tribunal
will conduct a mediation service at the preliminary hearing, but that
it may discuss with the parties whether they have explored the
possibilities. The parties should not be required to go into details of
any negotiations which have already taken place, since these are
likely to be ‘privileged’ (off the record).204 Nor should the claimant

be expected to tell the tribunal how much s/he would accept by way
of settlement, nor the employer to tell the tribunal how much s/he
would be prepared to offer. Nevertheless, where both parties are
open to the idea of settlement, it can be useful if the tribunal prompts
a discussion. There is also a little used judicial assessment
procedure which may encourage negotiation (see para 21.54). A very
good opportunity to reach an early agreement is to suggest a quick
chat in the waiting room after the preliminary hearing is completed.

Preliminary hearings – case management
20.154 Category a) in the list at para 20.151 is simply concerned with case

management. If no category b), c) or d) matters are involved, the
preliminary hearing will be conducted informally before an
employment judge sitting alone, attended by each party or his/her
representatives, at which the preparation of the case is moved on. It
will be a private hearing.
20.155
Case management preliminary hearings are unlikely to be fixed in
the vast majority of unfair dismissal or pay claims. They tend to be
arranged to help with the management of large complex cases, eg
with multiple claimants or involving claims of automatic unfair
dismissal and pre-dismissal detriments such as occur in
whistleblowing claims. Most tribunal regions will also routinely list
a preliminary hearing to carry out case management in discrimination
cases.205 There can be more than one preliminary hearing in a case,
but this is uncommon because it leads to additional expense for the
parties to attend.
20.156
The judge will usually start by identifying a ‘list of issues’ for the
case. The word ‘issues’ is confusing because it is used in other
contexts. However, a ‘list of issues’ has a specific meaning. It is a
technical idea which involves breaking down the key legal – and
sometimes factual – stages which will need to be decided by the
tribunal to arrive at its final decision. There are examples in
appendix A.206
20.157
The hearing will also deal with all or any outstanding procedural
issues that have not been resolved in correspondence, eg disclosure

of documents, fixing hearing dates, or ordering that cases be heard
together. The tribunal’s orders on those matters are often called
‘directions’.
20.158
A preliminary hearing dealing only with case management is likely
to take anything from 45 minutes to three hours depending on the
complexity of the issues, the clarity of the original ET1, how much is
already agreed between the parties and whether the parties are
represented.
20.159
Once the ET has sent notification of this kind of preliminary
hearing, it is worth trying to agree as much as possible with the
employer’s representative regarding which documents will be
disclosed, when to exchange witness statements, etc. This reduces
the chances of getting unsatisfactory orders from the tribunal and may
even obviate the need for the preliminary hearing altogether. If
agreement cannot be reached, the claimant should come to the
hearing with a typed draft list of issues and the orders s/he is
seeking. Ideally these should be sent to the employer and tribunal in
advance. This gives the claimant (especially if unrepresented) more
chance of getting what s/he wants out of the preliminary hearing.
Tribunals usually send out a ‘case management agenda’ form to be
completed in advance of the preliminary hearing which asks what
each party proposes. It is common for the employment judge to
encourage the parties to agree arrangements voluntarily. It is a good
idea to be co-operative where possible, but if one of the judge’s
suggestions would seriously harm the claimant’s case, and the
claimant wants to preserve the right to appeal, then s/he should not
agree, and the judge should be required to make an order.
20.160
Preliminary hearings concerned only with case management are
sometimes conducted by telephone conferencing. In the past, this was
usually where both parties were represented and had agreed the
issues and directions, or in certain regions where long travel
distances were involved. Since Covid, nearly all preliminary
hearings have usually been conducted this way (see para 20.229).
The conference call is set up by the ET, though the parties may be
asked to dial in.

Preliminary hearing – preliminary issues
20.161 Category b) in the list at para 20.151 above concerns preliminary

issues. This should not be confused with a ‘list of issues’ as
described above. Category b) refers to issues which can be decided
before the final hearing, eg as to whether the claimant had two years’
service. A preliminary hearing which will cover this ground is more
formal and it will be a public hearing, at least the part concerned
with those issues. The preliminary issues will be considered by an
employment judge alone, unless a party makes a written request that
the hearing is conducted by a full tribunal panel. In that case, it will
be for an employment judge to decide whether it would be desirable
to have a full panel.207
20.162
The outcome of the preliminary issues is usually very important to
the claimant as it tends to concern whether the ET has jurisdiction to
hear his/her case. For example, preliminary hearings are often held
where there is a dispute over whether the claimant has been
employed for at least two continuous years; was an employee;
worked under an illegal contract; commenced proceedings within the
time limit; etc. Many of these hearings can be quite lengthy and
complex, particularly if they concern TUPE issues or, in a
discrimination case, whether the claimant has a disability as defined
by the EqA 2010. A full-blown preliminary hearing covering these
sorts of issues could take half a day to a full day. On the other hand,
preliminary hearings concerning time limits on late unfair dismissal
claims tend to be very short, maybe lasting only an hour.
20.163
A preliminary hearing dealing with preliminary issues often takes
the form of a full hearing with witnesses and trial bundles, except
that it tends to be much shorter. Preparation is as for a full hearing,
except that the evidence is collected relating to the preliminary issue
alone. If the claimant and any other witnesses are to give evidence, it
is normally a good idea to prepare witness statements even if the ET
has not made any order to do so. Unless the entire claim is knocked
out by the preliminary issues, the employment judge will usually go
on to deal with case management arrangements. The claimant should
be prepared for this.

20.164

It is not always sensible and cost-effective to hold a preliminary
hearing on a preliminary issue. Sometimes, the evidence needed to
address the preliminary issue overlaps awkwardly with the evidence
relevant to the substantive case. There is also a risk that fact-findings
will be made at the preliminary hearing based on inadequate
evidence, because it was unclear that certain matters would arise.
Such fact-findings could then bind the ET at the final hearing. Or, a
preliminary hearing may be suggested to resolve an issue which,
even if decided against the claimant, will not save any time because
there will still be other outstanding claims covering the same ground.
The ET sometimes consults the parties about whether to order a
preliminary hearing. If there is no prior consultation, write in
promptly when one is ordered if you have any concerns.

Preliminary hearing – striking out and costs deposits
20.165 A preliminary hearing may also be arranged to decide whether to

strike out all or part of a claim or response under category c) in para
20.151 above. This part of the preliminary hearing must be held in
public. Very often the possibility of making a costs deposit order
under category d) is considered at the same time. The grounds for
strike out are set out at para 20.111 above. Again, it is unusual for
such a preliminary hearing to be held on an ordinary unfair dismissal
claim. It is more likely with a complex automatic unfair dismissal
claim such as whistleblowing or in discrimination cases.
20.166
Unlike preliminary issues, whether to strike out a claim (or
response) for having no reasonable prospect of success is often
decided purely on the basis of ‘representations’ or ‘submissions’ (ie
comments) by the representatives or unrepresented parties, rather
than having evidence and listening to witnesses and crossexamination, but there is no absolute rule. Strike-outs for this reason
have traditionally been ordered only where there are no factual
disputes on key points or where the case is hopeless even if the
claimant’s version of the facts is proved. Where important facts are
disputed, a tribunal should not make impromptu fact-findings or
assumptions about which facts will be proved without hearing

evidence properly at a full hearing.208 On the other hand, it may be
that the alleged facts can be conclusively disproved by an
unambiguous document. Or, a tribunal can decide to listen to
evidence on one or two key factual disputes and make fact-findings
which will enable it to decide whether there are reasonable
prospects of success.209 It is important to be prepared. The claimant
should read the notice of preliminary hearing carefully to see what
will be covered, and take notice of any case management orders, eg
to bring witness statements or written submissions to the preliminary
hearing regarding the strike-out issue.
20.167
Strike-outs are appropriate in extreme cases where there is no
reasonable prospect of success. Alternatively, if the ET considers
that any complaint or response to that complaint has little reasonable
prospect of success, it can give a costs warning and order the
claimant or employer (as applicable) to pay a deposit of £1,000 as a
condition of being permitted to continue with that complaint or
response to it.210 For example, a claimant may have brought a claim
for unfair dismissal and age discrimination. If the ET thinks the
unfair dismissal claim is fair enough, but the age discrimination
claim has little reasonable prospect of success, it can order the
claimant to pay a deposit as a condition of continuing with the
discrimination claim. In theory, several deposits could be ordered,
each one applying to different complaints. For example, the claimant
may have brought a claim that, as a result of whistleblowing, she was
given an unwarranted warning for poor timekeeping; she was not
given an office mobile phone; and eventually she was dismissed. A
tribunal may decide there is little reasonable prospect of success in
proving the warning was the result of whistleblowing because there
was documentary evidence that the claimant was persistently late,
and there is little reasonable prospect of proving the failure to give
her a phone was due to whistleblowing, since other people also
were not given an office mobile phone. However, the complaint that
she was dismissed for whistleblowing may appear to be reasonably
arguable. The tribunal could then order a £1,000 deposit if the
claimant wishes to continue with the disciplinary action complaint

and another £1,000 if she wishes to continue with the mobile phone
complaint.
20.168
The ET must make reasonable enquiries of the party’s financial
means to pay the deposit and must take such information into account
when deciding the amount of the deposit.211
20.169
The tribunal will send out a deposit order, giving fairly brief
reasons for making the order and will notify the party of the potential
consequences of the order. The order and accompanying notes will
set out the date for payment and how payment should be made. If the
claimant does not pay the deposit within the set time limit, the claim
(or particular allegation, as applicable) is automatically struck
out.212
20.170
If the claimant decides to pay the deposit and persist with the
complaint, s/he will get the deposit back if s/he ultimately wins
his/her case on the particular point; or if s/he loses, but for different
reasons to those given for making the deposit. On the other hand, if
the complaint is eventually decided against him/her for substantially
the same reasons as those given for making the deposit order, the
deposit will be paid over to the employer. Moreover, the claimant
will be treated as having acted unreasonably unless the contrary is
shown.213 This means s/he will be at great risk of having costs
awarded against him/her beyond the amount of the deposit. The same
rules apply in reverse if a deposit is awarded against the employer.
20.171
Whether or not a deposit has been required, any costs ultimately
ordered can substantially exceed £1,000. Costs may be awarded
against an unsuccessful party even if there has been no preliminary
hearing dealing with possible deposit orders, but there is an
increased likelihood of costs for unreasonably persisting with the
case where a hearing was held and a deposit was required.214 A
party should not think that they have a good case just because they
have escaped strike-out and only have a deposit order against them.
The law makes it very difficult for tribunals to strike out cases even
if they look weak. The award of a deposit is a very serious warning
that prospects do not look good at all.

20.172

If a preliminary hearing is fixed to consider whether a complaint
should be struck out as having no reasonable prospect of success or a
deposit ordered because the complaint has little reasonable prospect
of success, the claimant should sit down and think very carefully
about the legal and evidential strength of the case. It may be that the
preliminary hearing is to consider the entirety of the claim or maybe
only some complaints within the claim. In the latter case, the
claimant should consider whether s/he has allowed her ET1 to
become clogged up with too many peripheral issues. The best way to
prevent these issues being fixed for a preliminary hearing is to write
a good ET1, which demonstrates a sound understanding of the law, is
focused on the key complaints, and makes only relevant points.

Combined cases and lead cases
20.173 Where similar issues of fact or law are concerned, the ET may order

that cases brought by different claimants against the same employer
be considered together. This is sometimes loosely referred to as
‘consolidation’. The ET can do this of its own accord or on
application by either party. The ET can choose a lead case where
two or more claims give rise to common or related issues of fact or
law.215 Each party will have the opportunity to argue for or against
consolidation and careful consideration should be given to whether
tactically it would help the individual cases or save costs. The
commonest instances of consolidation are for multiple redundancy or
equal pay claims. Separate claims by the claimant made in separate
ET1 forms at different times can also be combined. For example, in a
discrimination case, there may be an initial ET1 regarding the
original discrimination and a further ET1 if the claimant is
subsequently dismissed, claiming victimisation and unfair dismissal.

Preparation for the hearing
Trial bundles
20.174 ETs

expect a joint bundle of documents to be agreed with the
employer. This is referred to as an ‘agreed trial bundle’. Tribunals

are trying to get away from jargon by calling it a ‘file’. In Scotland, it
is called an inventory or bundle of ‘productions’. The ‘trial bundle’
is the set of relevant documents which the parties want to refer to at
the hearing. The documents are usually put into one or more ring files
or lever-arch files. If there are only a handful of documents, a
treasury tag will do. The documents put into the trial bundle should
already have been shown to each other at the earlier disclosure
stage, but can now be whittled down to what is really necessary. The
trial bundle usually contains the ET1 and ET3; selected
correspondence from the case preparation, eg letters with additional
information; and documents which each side think are relevant for
the tribunal to see. Witness statements should be kept separate.
20.175
Trial bundles should be short and relevant. Not every document
produced on disclosure needs to go into the bundle. It is a waste of
money to add and copy pages of unnecessary documents, and large
files are also hard to work with at the hearing. Having said that, if
either party insists on certain documents going into the bundle, they
should normally be included. The parties are supposed to co-operate
with each other on this. If agreement really cannot be reached on the
content of the entire trial bundle, as much as possible at least should
be agreed and the claimant’s representative should prepare his/her
own small bundle of any additional documents which the respondents
will not agree to insert. In this instance, it is strongly advised that the
claimant’s representative prepare cross-examination from the page
numbering of the agreed bundle so far as possible, and not from any
documents duplicated in his/her own bundle. It will be confusing for
the representatives and annoying for the tribunal if each party is
working entirely from different bundles with different numbering for
the same documents.
20.176
Each party should bring to the tribunal their own copy of the joint
bundle and one or other will need to bring five extra copies (for a
full ET panel) or three (for an employment judge sitting alone).
These copies are for the tribunal panel/judge plus one copy for the
witness stand and an additional copy to be available for any member
of the public or press to look at while sitting in the hearing. The

bundle should have the ET1 and ET3 at the front and then the
documents in chronological order, numbered on each page and
indexed at the front. Sometimes, the ET orders the employer to
prepare the joint bundle and bring the extra copies, but it is always
better to prepare the trial bundle oneself. However tempting it is to
agree to an offer from the employer’s representative to do the work
(and bear the costs), this can mean getting the bundle at the very last
minute and in a shape which is not user-friendly.
20.177
Most tribunals expect the parties to bring the trial bundles with
them on the day, and will not accept them ahead of time unless there
is a particular reason agreed with the tribunal – eg the tribunal
intends to start reading documents and indeed witness statements on
the first day of a long hearing or, for reasons related to disability, a
party cannot carry the bundles with him/her on the day. Although
tribunals are at the moment still working from hard copy bundles
when the hearing takes place in the tribunal building, they do
sometimes ask for any electronic copy to be provided for their
private use.
20.178
If the hearing is to be conducted over a video platform (see para
20.228 onwards), the tribunal will want electronic bundles and
witness statements to be prepared. It is important to prepare the
bundles so that the numbering on the documents matches the
numbering on the computer. This may require having the index
separately. PDF-XChange is a useful software for opening pdf
bundles as it has an effective bookmark function. It is recommended
to bookmark key documents in advance.
20.179
Participating in a hearing over a video platform and looking at
electronic bundles and witness statements at the same time is very
difficult. Many witnesses and parties, and even some
representatives, will not have access to a second computer screen or
will find it difficult to work in this way. It is therefore important that
anyone who wants also has a hard copy bundle and witness
statements to work from.

Evidence related to compensation

Overview
20.180 The claimant should disclose to the employer before the hearing and

put into the trial bundle details of all efforts made to secure new
employment – eg letters, emails, copies of advertisements, details of
employment agencies contacted, jobcentre information about jobs
applied for and expenses. If the claimant wins and only wants
compensation, the ET will want to know that s/he has made genuine
efforts to obtain another job and ‘mitigate’ his/her loss.216 In
addition, the claimant should come prepared with a calculation of
both net weekly and gross weekly earnings with the previous
employer and those in any new employment. It may be necessary to
explain how these figures were arrived at and provide documentary
evidence.
20.181
The ET clerk will also want to know for recoupment purposes,
details of the benefit office dealing with the claimant’s claim for
jobseeker’s allowance (JSA), income support or universal credit.
Where it has been particularly hard to gain new employment due to
the way dismissal took place, a report from a doctor or employment
agency may help. If other factors caused difficulties – eg the
claimant’s age, disability, race or having a young child – specialist
evidence and reports will be useful.
Schedule of loss and mitigation or statement of remedy
20.182 It is now common for the ET to order the claimant to provide a

statement of what remedy s/he is claiming and a schedule of his/her
losses to date. The purpose of this is to increase the chances of a
negotiated settlement by focussing the claimant’s mind on what a
tribunal realistically can award and indicating to the employer what
the claimant is looking for. The schedule of loss often has to be
provided very early in the case preparation, and updated shortly
before or at the hearing. There is no standard format for such a
schedule or agreement on how detailed it should be, though some
tribunal regions send out a precedent. Essentially it should contain
details of the claimant’s estimate of what s/he would be earning had
s/he not been dismissed; the date of any new job and its pay; and any

other losses, eg pension rights or job-hunting expenses. It should
contain the heads of compensation claimed, eg loss of statutory
rights. Some ETs expect the claimant to fill in details which are
matters for the ET’s discretion, eg the number of weeks’ future loss
of earnings which is claimed. It is probably safer simply to write
‘Future loss @ £00 [specify sum] for the number of weeks which the
ET decides’. Where the schedule is used at the hearing in complex
cases, it is a nice idea to add two extra columns for the ET to
complete – one to contain the employer’s contentions under each
heading, and the final column to contain the ET’s decision. Various
model schedules of loss are in appendix A. Some ETs also ask for
‘mitigation’ to be included in the schedule. This means a list of the
steps taken by the claimant to mitigate his/her loss by finding another
job,217 eg a list of job applications (with date and mode of
application) and interviews attended.

Other preparation
20.183 In England and Wales, witness statements should be prepared for

each witness, signed and dated, and exchanged with the employer in
advance of the hearing (see below). Each side should bring three (or
five if a full panel) extra copies of their own witness statements to
the hearing for the ET judge/panel, witness box and to be read in the
room by any member of the public who is watching the hearing. The
witness statements should not be added into the trial bundle. Each
witness should be told where and when to attend the ET. It is a good
idea to explain the procedure to witnesses and to show them a copy
of the trial bundle or at least the key documents, so that they
understand the context of the case and see any documents on which
they might be cross-examined. The adviser should prepare for
his/her role as representative and in particular note down the key
points on which s/he wants to cross-examine the employer’s
witnesses. The adviser ought to be able to anticipate what the
employer will say at the hearing, especially if witness statements
have been exchanged in advance. The adviser should also meet the

claimant and go through any unexpected points in the employers’
witness statements.
20.184
If an adviser has not run a case before, it is a good idea to visit
another ET hearing to see what happens. The claimant may find this
useful too. Arrive before 10 am when the hearings start and ask the
clerk at reception which would be the most relevant case to watch,
or look on the list of cases on the notice board, which indicate by
initials the legal issues involved. For example, ‘UDL’ means unfair
dismissal. The clerks are usually very helpful if asked for assistance.
It may be a good idea to telephone late afternoon the previous day to
check there will be an open case to watch. While there are a large
number of video hearings due to the Covid-19 pandemic (see para
20.228 onwards), it is also possible to watch a hearing over a video
platform, but recording is prohibited.
20.185
If a party or witness needs any adjustments because of disability
or vulnerability, ensure the tribunal and other side know as soon as
possible. The tribunal also needs to be given good notice if an
interpreter is required. See chapter 21 on these matters.

Witness statements
Overview
20.186 ETs

in England and Wales now routinely expect the parties to
provide written ‘witness statements’ for their witnesses and this is
likely to be contained in the standard set of case management orders.
Except in exceptional circumstances, witness statements will stand
as those witnesses’ evidence in chief. The witness will rarely be
required to read the statement out loud and the tribunal is likely to
take time out at the start of the hearing to read the witness statements
to itself. Where it is said that the witness statements will be ‘taken as
read’, this means the tribunal will read the witness statements to
itself in this way.
20.187
The witness will therefore not give her evidence verbally in
question and answer format to his/her own representative. S/he will
immediately be cross-examined by the other representative, although

as explained later in this chapter, the claimant’s representative can
usually ask a few ‘supplementary questions’ first. The purpose of
written statements is to speed up the proceedings and to let the
parties know in advance what the evidence is going to be. ETs
expect all the parties’ evidence to be in the witness statements apart
from any new issues arising from the other side’s witness statements.
The ET will get annoyed if the claimant or employer’s witness
statements are sketchy and too many extra questions are asked which
could have been included in the first place. In complex cases, to
avoid any extra verbal questions, some ETs order that further or
supplementary witness statements are exchanged within seven days
of the exchange of the original witness statements. However, this
does seem rather clumsy and excessive in terms of paperwork. If it
does happen, be careful to include all evidence in the statements as
the ET is unlikely to allow any supplementary questions at the
hearing.
20.188
Usually there has been some agreement between the parties or
suggestion (or an order) by the ET that the witness statements should
be exchanged seven or 14 days in advance of the hearing. It may have
been ordered in a standard ET case management timetable, or
otherwise the adviser could suggest this at the time of requesting
additional information and documents. The agreed trial bundle
should be completed before the witness statements are exchanged, so
that there are no surprise documents produced by the employer after
the claimant has set out his/her full story. This is also necessary if
page references for key documents are to be inserted in the witness
statements.
20.189
It is important to exchange witness statements simultaneously with
the employer, so there is no risk of last-minute alterations. It is
usually best to suggest the employer deliver his/her statements by
messenger and the claimant will hand over his/her own witness
statements to the messenger by way of exchange. Alternatively it can
be done by return of fax or email. If attaching to an email, make sure
‘track changes’ is not visible when the statement is printed out!

It may not be possible to get a witness statement in advance where
a witness has been compelled to attend by a witness order or only
traced at the last minute. Although an ET may be reluctant to exclude
evidence from a witness altogether if there is no statement, it may ask
for one to be written up on the spot, and may order costs if time is
wasted as a result.
20.191
Although technically an ET can choose to read and take account of
a written and signed witness statement where the witness does not
come to the hearing, such an approach is not very effective or
persuasive because the evidence cannot be tested in crossexamination. The ET often says it will ‘go to its weight’, ie the ET
will read the witness statement, but is unlikely to place much
reliance on it. It would therefore be unusual for a party to use a
witness statement without calling the witness to attend. Witness
statements are rarely used in Scotland, although more than they used
to be. In whistleblowing and discrimination claims, the judge will
discuss with the parties whether to use witness statements.
20.190

How should a witness statement be written?
20.192 Ideally a witness statement should be set out clearly, with typed and

numbered short paragraphs, and subheadings to break up the text.
Where documents are referred to, the page number(s) in the trial
bundle should be noted in brackets. If there are documents which are
particularly helpful, it is advisable to further highlight the page
references, so they do not get overlooked, or the adviser should make
a separate list of key documents for the tribunal.218 Wide margins and
double-spacing are useful to enable annotations to be made by the ET
panel and representatives, as evidence is given during the hearing.
Dates and names should always be stated in full.
20.193
The witness’s evidence should be written in a logical order,
usually explaining a few important background details first and then
telling the story chronologically. This is very important. It is not
helpful to the tribunal if the statement jumps around or is structured
by answering points in the ET3. Care should be taken with accuracy
and consistency of detail. Always bear in mind what are the relevant

legal and factual issues, and provide the evidence which is relevant
to those. For example, in an unfair dismissal case, draw attention to
lack of warnings or inadequate investigation; in a discrimination
case, always draw attention to different treatment.219 If there are
problem areas, as a matter of tactics it may be useful to lessen the
impact of cross-examination by dealing with those areas in the
statement. Statements should not be too long. Remember that the
tribunal will have to read and absorb a number of witness statements
and documents. As an extremely approximate rule of thumb, a
claimant’s witness statement in an ordinary unfair dismissal case
may not need to be any longer than 3,500–6,000 words. The
important thing is to focus on the key issues, so they do not get
forgotten in a mass of detail.
20.194
Ensure that the claimant fully agrees with the content of the
statement and that s/he understands all the words used. Try to use the
words and expressions that the claimant usually uses him/herself to
describe the events. It is unwise to ask the claimant to write his/her
own statement with a view simply to tidying it up – such a statement
may be poorly structured, include irrelevant information and exclude
relevant information.
20.195
Tell the claimant in advance that there is nothing wrong with an
adviser having written the statement in consultation with him/her.
Otherwise, if asked directly at the hearing whether s/he wrote the
statement, the claimant may become anxious and not tell the truth.
20.196
Where the witness statement needs to be written in a different
language, see para 21.68.

Interpreters and witness expenses
20.197 The position regarding claims for witness expenses and provision of

interpreters is the same for all types of tribunal claim and is set out
in chapter 21 at para 21.80. See also para 20.265 below regarding
costs orders for witness expenses.

Reading lists

20.198 In long cases with a large number of documents and several witness

statements – eg some constructive dismissal or whistleblowing
dismissal cases – tribunals may ask for a ‘reading list’ at the outset.
Even in short cases, tribunals may find it useful to be offered a brief
list. Although many documents are routinely cross-referred in a
witness statement by way of confirmatory evidence of the sequence
of events, they do not necessarily add any evidence crucial to the
outcome of the case. Tribunals would therefore often prefer the
parties to produce a combined list of the most essential documents to
read at this stage. If such a list has not been agreed with the other
side, the claimant can still proffer his/her own list. These are not the
only documents which the tribunal will read. The representatives can
ask witnesses and the tribunal to look at many other documents
during cross-examination. However, these are the documents which
it is helpful to look at before the case starts, eg the dismissal or
resignation letter, the letter of appeal and the appeal outcome letter. It
is advisable to keep this list short and essential. It is not usually
necessary to ask tribunals to read lengthy minutes or transcripts of
disciplinary and appeal meetings. This can take a long time. If there
is no serious dispute about what was said in the disciplinary or
appeal, its character and content can briefly be described in the
witness statements rather than asking the ET to read laboriously
through pages of dialogue. If it is disputed that certain important
things were said at such a meeting, then take the opposition witness
to the relevant passage during cross-examination, or ask the tribunal
to read certain passages.

The hearing
Arrival
20.199 On the day of the hearing, arrive early and check in with the clerk at

reception. The clerk will indicate whether the case has been
allocated to a particular tribunal panel/employment judge or whether
the case is unallocated, ie ‘floating’ or a ‘floater’. The cases are
usually also listed on a notice board in the reception area. Allocated

cases usually start at 10 am. An unallocated case joins a queue and
will be heard by the first ET to come free. This may involve a long
delay. Many cases float each day. Some tribunals have press in
attendance, who sit in on the hearings. In particularly sensitive cases,
it is possible to ask the tribunal at any stage to make an order to
protect privacy. For details, see paras 21.56–21.61.
20.200
If a party fails to attend or to send a representative in his/her
place, the ET can go ahead and decide the claim or dismiss it in
his/her absence. The ET must first consider any information it has
about the reason for the party’s absence and make any enquiries
which are practicable.220 Usually this means the ET should try to
telephone the missing party.221
20.201
Claimants and respondents normally have separate waiting rooms
and, in many tribunals, there are a number of private meeting rooms
available for use. Visit the employer in the respondents’ waiting
room to sort out any last-minute problems and to see what witnesses
are there. This is often an opportunity to discuss settlement. Give the
employer’s representative copies of any cases that will be referred
to in the closing speech. The clerk will visit each side in their
waiting rooms to collect the trial bundles and witness statements for
the employment judge or ET panel and witness box. If there is any
doubt whether a witness will be called, hold back the relevant
witness statement in case the ET reads it first. It used to be the
practice that the names and references of any cases to be referred to
in closing were also given to the clerk together with copies of the
cases. This is unusual now, but may be useful if there is a crucial
case which you would like to alert the tribunal to from the outset.
20.202
The clerk will ask whether the witnesses will swear or affirm
when giving evidence. ‘Affirming’ is a formal, non-religious,
promise to tell the truth. If witnesses require any holy book other than
the New Testament, the clerk should be told at this point, eg the Old
Testament, or Torah for Jewish witnesses; the Koran for Muslims
and the Bhagavadgita (or ‘Gita’) for Hindus. Some witnesses may
prefer to affirm rather than invoke a religious book in this context or,
for example, where they do not have facilities to wash first. Where it

is preferable not to touch a Holy Book because of pandemic
precautions, or where an oath is sworn at home on a video hearing,
the Judicial College’s Equal Treatment Bench Book advises that it is
unnecessary for the witness to hold or have the religious book.222
See paras 21.65–21.71 regarding accessibility of tribunals to people
wearing religious dress or with a disability.
20.203
The time before the hearing starts can be used to clear up lastminute queries and to calm the claimant and witnesses. Cases often
settle on the morning of the hearing, so the representative should
have in mind what the claimant wants, and terms of settlement, and
should bring precedents for settlements and consent orders, and a
calculator. If part of the settlement would be an agreed reference,
which is common, a draft should have been prepared in advance.223

Composition of the ET panel
20.204 In the past, the vast majority of tribunal cases could only be heard by

a three-person panel. One of the first changes to ETs made by the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government was to
remove the absolute requirement for full panels on unfair dismissal
claims from 6 April 2012. The position now is that an employment
judge will hear an unfair dismissal claim alone unless s/he decides
there should be a full tribunal panel having regard to the likelihood
of a factual dispute or legal issue of a kind which would make it
desirable for there to be a full panel and the views of the parties.224
In practice, it is unusual for the parties to seek, or for judges to order,
a full panel. Certain other claims were already heard by a judge
sitting alone before April 2012 on the same basis, eg claims for
breach of contract, payslips, a section 1 statement of particulars,
unauthorised deductions from pay, or leave entitlement under the
Working Time Regulations 1998. If any of these claims is heard at the
same time as a claim which still requires a full panel, then a full
panel will hear all the claims.
20.205
Full panels are now compulsory only for a few types of case, most
notably discrimination claims under the EqA 2010 and claims for
unlawful detriment, eg for whistleblowing. Rather strangely, a claim

by an employee for automatic unfair dismissal for whistleblowing
need not routinely be heard by a full panel because it is an unfair
dismissal claim, but a claim for a detriment short of dismissal, such
as a disciplinary warning due to whistleblowing, or for the
termination of a worker’s employment (which technically is a
‘detriment’ claim rather than an ‘unfair dismissal’ claim, because
only employees can claim unfair dismissal) must still be heard by a
full panel. Therefore, a whistleblowing claim for dismissal and predismissal detriments will be heard by a full panel.
20.206
An employment judge must have been a solicitor, barrister,
advocate or legal executive of at least five years’ standing. Non
employment judges can also now be nominated to sit in ETs. Where a
full panel is required, a judge is joined by two non-legal members.
These are drawn from each side of industry (employer and
employee-orientated background), but are not there to represent an
interest group and must take a neutral position in deciding cases. The
judge chairs the panel. ET panel decisions can be by a majority, but
are usually unanimous.

The employment tribunal’s approach
20.207 The original intention was for the hearing of unfair dismissal claims

to be expedient, simple and informal. ETs still aim to avoid undue
formality. Nevertheless, the formality of a hearing can vary quite
widely depending on the nature of the claims, the level of cooperation or hostility between the parties, whether the parties are
represented and the approach of any such representatives. Always
call the employment judge ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’ and remain seated. The
other representative can be addressed by name (Mr/Ms/Mrs …),
although barristers tend to call each other ‘my friend’ or ‘my learned
friend’. The room is set out informally and no one wears a wig and
gown. However, the witnesses and representatives should dress
smartly and behave appropriately. Remember, it is a court of law and
everyone in the room is very visible to the tribunal panel. See para
20.228 onwards, where a witness wants to attend a hearing by video
link.

ETs may decide on the most appropriate procedure for the hearing,
taking account of the principles contained in the overriding
objective.225 They are not generally bound by the strict rules
regarding admissible evidence applicable in the civil and criminal
courts. ETs are allowed to question parties and witnesses so far as
appropriate to elicit the issues and clarify the evidence. It should not
be taken as an indication of hostility, favouritism or bias that an ET
is asking questions as matters proceed. Equally, it is the job of
employment judges to keep evidence relevant and to the point. It is
quite normal for witnesses to be told more than once to answer the
question or speak more concisely and for representatives to be told
to keep to issues which are relevant to the legal questions to be
decided. Tribunals are also explicitly allowed under the 2013 rules
to impose time limits on the time a party may take in presenting
evidence, cross-examining the other side’s witnesses or making
submissions (ie comments on any point, including closing speeches).
The ET can prevent the party carrying on beyond the allocated
time.226 It is very common for tribunals to timetable the evidence at
the outset of the hearing, eg to say how much time each side will
have for cross-examination. Advisers tend to overestimate in
advance how much time they will have for cross-examination.
Remember that the ET also needs to allow time for reading the
witness statements, swearing witnesses in, supplementary questions,
re-examination, tribunal questions, final comments and various other
issues which might unexpectedly arise.
20.209
Taking all that into account, if the claimant’s claim is harmed by
unreasonable conduct by the ET, eg refusal to allow crucial evidence
to be called, this could be a ground of appeal. The representative
should object at the time and ask the ET to note the objection. If there
is an appeal, the employment judge’s notes, if relevant, will be
ordered. An appeal can also be made if it is felt that the ET is biased
or any member has a conflict of interest, eg has some connection with
the employer or claimant. If it is intended to appeal on any of these
points, an objection must usually first be raised in the ET. Because of
the potential consequences, the representative should ask for five
20.208

minutes to consult the claimant privately before making any
objection.
20.210
At the start of the hearing, the ET will go through the legal issues
to be decided. These are fairly standard in an unfair dismissal
claim.227 It will also deal with any preliminary matters such as
arguments about the documents. The parties should normally have
written to each other about any outstanding matters a reasonable time
before the hearing, so no one is caught by surprise. The ET will want
to get on with the case, rather than get involved in arguments between
the parties about matters such as late disclosure of documents and
witness statements. Unless the claimant is genuinely disadvantaged
by very late disclosure, it is best not to raise such matters.
20.211
The ET usually informs the parties at this stage how it wants the
hearing conducted and says whether it wants to hear evidence about
remedy (efforts to get new employment) at the same time as evidence
on liability (the win/lose decision), or only if and when the claimant
wins. Where remedy is to be left until after the decision on liability,
the ET should also clarify at the outset whether it will decide any
issues of Polkey,228 contributory fault (in a conduct dismissal) and
ACAS adjustments of compensation as part of its decision on
liability.229 If the ET does not clarify all this, then ask.

The order of events
20.212 It is likely that after these introductory matters, the parties will be

asked to stay in their waiting rooms while the ET reads the witness
statements and key documents. In a large case where each side is
represented, the tribunal may prefer to read each witness statements
immediately before hearing from that witness, so it may start by
reading the witness statement of the first witness and perhaps the
main witness on the other side. On a short case or if one side is
unrepresented, it is more likely to read all the witness statements at
the outset.
20.213
Once the ET has read the papers, the clerk will fetch everyone
back for the hearing to continue. If there is a dispute over whether
there was a dismissal, the claimant goes first. Otherwise the

employer starts in an unfair dismissal case.230 Opening speeches
were dispensed with many years ago, and now the parties go straight
into the evidence. Occasionally in a complex case, a party might
voluntarily provide the tribunal with some short written ‘opening
submissions’, perhaps two or three pages long. This is usually an
attempt to get the tribunal to see the case in a certain light from the
outset.
20.214
Assuming the employer starts, s/he will call his/her witnesses
first. Each witness will be asked to stand and take the oath or affirm
to tell the truth. The witness will then sit and will give his/her
‘evidence in chief’. If a witness statement has been prepared, most of
the evidence in chief will consist of the statement. By way of
introducing the statement, the adviser asks the witness to confirm
his/her name and address, that it is his/her statement and that its
contents are believed to be accurate and true. Nearly always, the
tribunal will have read the statement to itself as already described.
However, there may be rare circumstances where the tribunal thinks
it a good idea to ask the witness to read out the witness statement.
Whether or not the witness statement was pre-read by the ET, the
witness’s representative is usually allowed to ask some
supplementary questions, though not too many.231 This is partly to
deal with any important parts of the employer’s case which first
appeared in the latter’s witness statements and therefore have not
been covered in the witness statements of the claimant’s own
witnesses. It also helps the witness settle in before crossexamination to ask him/her to explain one or two relevant matters in
his/her own words.
20.215
In Scotland, witness statements have traditionally been ordered
less frequently, and the evidence in chief may be given by the witness
answering the representative’s questions. This may have changed
more recently, and it is best to check the tribunal’s orders and current
practice.
20.216
The representative must not ‘lead’ his/her own witness, ie must
not ask a question in such a way that it suggests to the witness what
the answer should be. For example, s/he must ask: ‘What did you do

next?’ as opposed to: ‘Did you then go to see the HR director?’
However, if the facts to be established are not in dispute by the other
side, the representative can lead, eg: ‘I think we all agree that you
went on holiday from 1 to 14 August’.
20.217
After the evidence in chief is finished, the claimant’s
representative can then ask questions. This is called crossexamination and ‘leading questions’ are permitted. After that, the
employer’s representative can ask a few more questions, simply
clearing up anything that arose in cross-examination. This is called
re-examination. Either before or after re-examination, the ET panel
usually questions the witness. During cross-examination, the
employment judge may also have asked some questions for
clarification. In Scotland, the ET panel tends to ask more questions
than in England and Wales, but there is no absolute rule. The degree
of questioning will depend on factors such as the nature of the case,
how clearly it is being presented by witness and representative, and
the approach of the particular employment judge.
20.218
The same process is followed with each witness. After all the
employer’s witnesses have given evidence, the claimant is
immediately called to give evidence and then any of the claimant’s
witnesses. In Scotland, witnesses must stay outside the room until
after they have given evidence. In England and Wales, witnesses are
allowed to sit in the room throughout and usually do. Although there
has been an explicit power in the rules since 2004 to request that a
particular witness be excluded from the room while others give
evidence, this is not frequently done in England and Wales, possibly
because parties rarely ask.232 If there is a break in the middle of a
witness’s evidence, including an overnight break, the witness will be
told that s/he must not discuss his/her evidence with anyone else. It is
very important that the witness complies with this rule.233
20.219
It is useful to prepare in advance of the hearing a chronology, ie a
list of the important dates; as well as a ‘cast list’, ie a list of the
names and job title of the main characters, particularly those who
will be giving evidence. These can be handed to the ET and the
employer’s representative at the outset. Ideally the content would be

agreed with the employer’s representative in advance, but this rarely
happens unless the ET has made a specific order.

The closing speech
20.220 At the end of the evidence, it is customary for each party to make a

closing speech to the ET. This is sometimes called ‘closing
submissions’ or ‘final submissions’. In England and Wales, the party
which started usually addresses the ET last. In Scotland, it tends to
be the opposite. The length of the speech depends on the complexity
of the case, but the ET should not be bored. In a simple one-day
hearing where the ET has just heard all the evidence, a closing
speech may not last much longer than 10–15 minutes. The main point
of the closing speech is to relate the key points of evidence to the
relevant law. If the employer’s representative will have the last
word, the claimant’s should anticipate and deal with the employer’s
strong points in his/her closing speech.
20.221
It is best to prepare the closing speech in advance, amending it
through the course of the hearing to reflect what emerges. If the
hearing lasts more than one day, it is useful to produce written
submissions or at least a ‘skeleton argument’, ie an outline of the
main points which are expanded verbally in the closing speech. The
ET should be reminded of the main issues and related evidence.
Where there is a conflict of evidence, it can be suggested why the ET
should prefer the claimant’s witnesses. Rather than make general
points about why the claimant and his/her witnesses are credible and
the respondent’s witnesses are not, it is more useful to focus on the
key factual disputes and say why the tribunal should make each
finding which supports the claimant’s case.
20.222
If any reported cases are referred to, remember that only the
decision of the most senior court on a particular issue is important.
Most unfair dismissal cases are decided on their facts and case-law
need not be routinely referred to. On the whole, it is not necessary to
read extracts from the case-law unless there is an unusual or difficult
legal issue. The ET will be familiar with the main cases and legal
principles and a key authority may just be referred to by name.

Copies of the full case report (from IRLR or ICR or, if unreported,
from the EAT website or the Bailii website) should be handed to
each member of the ET and employer’s representative unless it is a
very well-known case such as Polkey.234 Where a case is less
commonly referred to, but does contain an important point, then it is
recommended that the key paragraphs are read to the ET and not just
noted down in written submissions. If references are made to
reported cases, advisers should make sure that they fully know and
understand them.
20.223
Sometimes there is only enough time at the hearing to finish the
evidence and a new date would need to be fixed for closing
speeches. Provided the parties agree, the ET may suggest each side
send in written closing submissions within seven or 14 days and that
the ET’s decision then be sent out in writing. The ET should order
that the submissions are exchanged between the parties so that each
side has the opportunity to comment on the other’s submissions.235

The judgment
20.224 The ET’s decision, where the case was heard by a panel, is usually

unanimous, although it may be by a majority. As already explained, a
judge is likely to have heard an unfair dismissal claim alone. In
England and Wales, the ET’s judgment is usually given verbally at
the end of the hearing, after the tribunal has taken a break of a few
hours to reach its decision. The judgment will subsequently be
confirmed in writing and sent to the parties. Sometimes the tribunal
suggests the representatives wait at the tribunal while the judgment is
typed up, so they can take it away with them. If a barrister represents
the claimant and the instructing solicitor has not come to the tribunal,
the latter must remember to get the hard copy of the judgment from
the barrister. The judgment simply states the ET’s decision (eg ‘the
claimant was unfairly dismissed’) and may include compensation, a
declaration or recommendation (in a discrimination case), and any
costs order.236 It usually fits onto one page, sometimes two. In a
complex case or where time has run out, the judgment may be
‘reserved’, ie made at a later date and sent to the parties. This can

mean a wait of a few months. A long and unreasonable delay in
providing the judgment, even by as much as a year, will not in itself
constitute a ground for appeal. Only in exceptional cases will
unreasonable delay amount to a real risk that someone has been
deprived of their right to a fair hearing under ECHR Article 6.237 In
Scotland, the ET rarely announces its judgment at the end of the
hearing.
20.225
When the judgment is given orally at the end of the hearing, the
reasons are usually given orally at the same time, although this is not
compulsory. The parties will be told that if they want written
reasons, they must ask there and then at the hearing or make a written
request within 14 days of the date the judgment is sent to the
parties.238 This time limit can be extended if the ET thinks it
appropriate.239 It is essential to ask for written reasons if planning to
appeal. The written reasons are much longer than the judgment. As a
rough guide, they may well amount to 7–20 pages in an unfair
dismissal case, longer in a discrimination one. They should include
the issues relevant to the claim; relevant fact findings; a concise
statement of the law; how the law has been applied to the facts to
determine the issues; and, if compensation has been awarded, details
as to how it has been calculated.240 When the ET reserves its
judgment instead of announcing it at the hearing, it must send it to the
parties subsequently together with written reasons.241
20.226
It is important not to get confused between the written judgment
and the written reasons (if any), which are usually contained in
separate documents – both will be needed if the claimant wants to
appeal. If written reasons are given at the same time as the judgment
(eg because judgment was reserved or because written reasons were
asked for at the end of the hearing), they will usually be contained on
the same document, ie the start of the document will be headed
‘Judgment’ and will set out the judgment in a few lines, followed by
the heading ‘Reasons’ and the reasons.
20.227
The tribunal may have taken evidence regarding compensation
(remedies) at the same time as it heard evidence relevant to liability
(ie whether or not the claimant wins the case). If this was not done,

then if the ET decides the dismissal is unfair at the end of the
hearing, it may go on to deal with the evidence about compensation,
or it may adjourn (ie take a break) and suggest that the parties reach
agreement on compensation. The parties may be able to do this
immediately by talking in the waiting rooms. If so, any agreement
should be written, signed and shown to the ET. The clerk will make
copies. Alternatively, the ET may send the parties away, on the basis
that settlement discussions will take place outside the ET on another
day. As long as the ET has reached a final decision on liability, ie
that the claimant was successful, then it should only be the
compensation which is settled. Depending on the wording of the
agreement, this may prevent the original judgment regarding liability
being appealed. Time should not be allowed to drift. If no agreement
can be achieved, then the claimant can simply write to the ET asking
for a hearing on compensation to be fixed. Delays in setting a date
for the compensation hearing can cause financial distress to the
claimant and may also deprive him/her of the benefit of interest on an
unpaid award. Sometimes there will be concerns about the
employer’s continuing ability to pay any award. For this reason, even
where the ET does not reach a decision at the end of the hearing and
reserves its judgment, it may well set a provisional date for a
remedies hearing (without prejudging its decision), in case the
claimant wins.

Remote hearings
20.228 Hearings can be conducted by electronic communication, including

telephone, provided a tribunal considers it would be just and
equitable to do so and provided the parties and any members of the
public attending the hearing can hear what the tribunal hears and can
see any witness as seen by the tribunal.242 A ‘remote’ hearing means
one which is conducted over an audio or video platform. To ensure
open justice where a hearing is wholly remote or only the tribunal
panel is in the building, a member of the public or press can observe
it by obtaining dial in / log on details from the tribunal

administration. It is a criminal offence for anyone to record or
broadcast a tribunal hearing without the tribunal’s permission.
20.229
Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, few hearings were held remotely.
At most, certain regions held case management preliminary hearings
over the telephone, and a witness based abroad might give evidence
over a video-link for a hearing otherwise conducted in a tribunal
building. The pandemic has transformed practice. Full merits
hearings and preliminary hearings deciding preliminary issues as
well as judicial mediation have largely been held over video
platforms, usually Cloud Video Platform (CVP) or Teams. Case
management preliminary hearings have been held by audio
conferencing (usually BT Meet Me) and sometimes video. The
quality of the hardware and software and the ability of judges and
non-legal members to operate it has increased very rapidly. There
are Practice Directions on remote hearings from the Presidents of
England and Wales and Scotland, supplemented in England and
Wales by Presidential Guidance.243
20.230
Ongoing safety measures mean that many buildings are not
operating at full capacity. Together with backlogs caused by the early
lockdowns, it is likely that remote hearings will operate in tandem
with in-person hearings (ie hearings in the tribunal buildings) for a
few more years. Although the Presidents have said that in-person
hearings are the ideal to be returned to, the option of holding remote
hearings is unlikely to disappear altogether in the future.
20.231
The Presidents issue regular ‘road maps’ to indicate their plans.244
The road map for 2021/2 says the default position is that judicial
mediations and case management preliminary hearings will be held
by telephone or video; preliminary hearings to decide preliminary
issues or strike out / deposit orders will default to video as will
claims for unpaid wages, holiday pay, redundancy pay etc. Final
hearings of unfair dismissal and discrimination claims will vary
around the country, with many regions returning in greater numbers to
in-person hearings, but London and the South East retaining video
hearings for unfair dismissal and still relying heavily on video
(including hybrid formats) for discrimination claims. A ‘hybrid’

format means at least one participant (judge / tribunal member /
representative / witness / party / interpreter) joins remotely and at
least one is in the building.
20.232
A judge can decide at any stage whether a hearing should be held
remotely or in-person and the parties can express their views. The
standard claim and response forms now ask whether the parties
would be able to participate in a video hearing. Considerations
would be whether the venue and travel is safe; the availability of
hardware, software and HMCTS staff to facilitate a remote hearing;
ability of parties to engage meaningfully with a remote hearing
including whether they are legally represented; nature of the
evidence; and risks of delay. The personal circumstances, disability
or vulnerability of any participant (tribunal panel, interpreter, party,
witness etc) may mean that attendance in person is either positively
desirable for more effective communication or undesirable because
of clinical vulnerability or the need to use public transport.245
20.233
There are various practicalities which representatives need to be
aware of when preparing for a remote hearing. Many of these are set
out in Presidential Guidance.246 In particular:
•

An electronic trial bundle must be prepared in accordance with tribunal requirements and
provided to the tribunal. This can be difficult with large bundles, but the tribunal is gradually
introducing an electronic uploading facility.

•

Electronic witness statements must be provided to the tribunal.

•

All parties and witnesses need the electronic trial bundle and witness statements plus hard
copies if they do not have a second computer screen which they find easy to use.

•

It is rarely suitable for a party or witness to join a video hearing using a smart phone. A
decent size screen is usually necessary to see the other participants and certainly any
documents which are shown.

•

A means of direct communication should be arranged between the representative and the
party / witnesses. This cannot be used while the witness is giving evidence, but is important
the rest of the time.

•

Ensure the party / witness has a quiet space to attend the hearing. If interruptions are
inevitable, it is best to tell the judge at the outset.

•

Ensure the party / witness understands that they should take the hearing just as seriously
and formally as if they were in the building.

•

Parties and witnesses will generally be required to keep their cameras on, but to have their
audio on mute except when giving evidence.

•

See para 20.202 regarding taking a religious oath.

•

Be prepared for the hearing to be tiring.

20.234 Interestingly, there are strongly divergent views held within the legal

profession, among parties and indeed among judges and tribunal
members, regarding whether in-person or remote hearings are
preferred. There are obviously pros and cons, even without the extra
element of Covid-19 precautions. The advantage of a remote hearing
is avoiding the need to travel in and out to the venue. Some parties
and witnesses find it less intimidating to attend from home. This
might be particularly important, eg, where a claimant bringing a
sexual harassment claim wants to avoid being close to the alleged
perpetrator, or where a party or witness has a level of anxiety or
autism which makes tribunal attendance particularly worrying. On
the other hand, communication can be more difficult across a video
platform. Again, this may particularly disadvantage witnesses with
certain disabilities. For a further discussion of difficulties which
may arise and possible adjustments, see guidance in appendix E of
the Judicial College’s Equal Treatment Bench Book.

Appeals and reconsideration
Overview
20.235 A claimant who is unhappy with the ET’s judgment, including any

costs order, may be able to ask the ET to reconsider its decision or,
alternatively, may appeal to the EAT, or both. Whereas there is a 42day time limit for lodging an appeal, there is only 14 days to seek a
reconsideration. The reconsideration process does not apply to case
management orders, though the ET can always be asked to vary its
decision under its general case management powers.247 An appeal to
the EAT can be made against judgments or case management orders,
eg those which refuse additional information or disclosure or a
request to postpone.

Reconsideration by the employment tribunal
20.236 The ET has power on its own initiative or, more commonly, at a

party’s request, to ‘reconsider’ any ET judgment where it is in the
interests of justice to do so.248 For example, a claimant may ask the
ET to reconsider its decision to reject an unfair dismissal claim, or
its decision to award costs against the claimant or, during case
preparation, s/he may ask the ET to reconsider a judgment on a
preliminary issue, eg that s/he is not disabled, or that all or part of
the claim should be struck out.
20.237
‘Reconsideration’ is a technical term, but it means what it says.
Under the pre-2013 procedural rules, the reconsideration process
was known as a ‘review’ and it could only be sought on certain
listed grounds. There are no specified grounds in the 2013 rules.
Nevertheless, there does need to be some reason why it would be in
the interests of justice to change a decision which has already been
made. Asking an ET simply to reconsider the same evidence and
legal arguments which it has already considered in making its
original decision is unlikely to be very effective. Traditionally the
kind of reasons which have been an appropriate basis for
reconsideration are these:
•

New evidence has become available since the conclusion of the hearing, whose existence
could not have been reasonably known or foreseen at the time of the hearing and which
would have had an important influence on the result of the case.

•

An important case in the higher courts has been decided subsequent to the decision in the
present case, which changes the relevant legal position.

•

The ET made a mathematical error in calculating compensation, or made a decision on
compensation without asking the parties for their comments.

•

The decision was made in the absence of a party, eg because s/he did not receive
notification of the hearing date or because s/he had a very good reason for not attending.
However, bear in mind that a party should usually attend a hearing unless the ET has
accepted a request for a postponement, and it will be rare for reconsideration to succeed if
the party has just failed to turn up.249

20.238 If the claimant wants a reconsideration, s/he must apply for it orally

at the hearing, or in writing, stating the grounds in full, within 14

days of the date when the relevant judgment was sent to him/her or, if
written reasons were sent later, within 14 days of when those
reasons were sent.250 The ET has a general power to extend time
limits if appropriate.251 The first stage is an individual consideration
of the application by an employment judge, who will refuse to hold
the reconsideration if there is no reasonable prospect of the original
decision being varied or revoked.252 This includes where
substantially the same application for reconsideration has already
been made and refused, unless there are special reasons. Otherwise,
the ET will send out a notice to the parties, setting a time limit for the
employer to make comments on the application and seeking
everyone’s views on whether the application can be decided without
a hearing.253 The judge may choose to set out his/her provisional
views on the likelihood of the application succeeding.
20.239
Provided the application was not refused at the first stage, the
procedure then moves on to a second stage. The reconsideration will
then take place at a hearing unless the judge decides a hearing is not
necessary in the interests of justice, having taken into account any
response by the employer. If the reconsideration goes ahead without
a hearing, each side will be given a reasonable opportunity to make
further written comments.254
20.240
Where practical, the initial consideration at the first stage will be
made by the employment judge who made the original decision
which the claimant wants reconsidered, or, if it was a full tribunal
panel, the judge who chaired the panel. If the procedure moves on to
the second stage, the reconsideration will be made by the judge or, as
the case may be, the full tribunal which made the original
decision.255
20.241
The same process applies where it is the employer who applies
for a reconsideration. Where the ET proposes to reconsider a
decision on its own initiative, all the parties will be told the reasons
and will be given a reasonable opportunity to make written
comments or attend a hearing.256
20.242
On reconsideration, the ET can confirm, vary or revoke its
decision and can take a new decision. The ET may order a rehearing

before the same or a different tribunal. It is important to read the
ET’s notification of the reconsideration carefully, as it may move on
to a rehearing of the full case on the same day, immediately
following a successful reconsideration. Note that clerical errors and
accidental slips, eg typos or minor numerical mistakes in calculating
compensation, can simply be corrected by the ET under the ‘slip
rule’ without any reconsideration.257

Appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal
20.243 The employment part of the GOV.UK website provides guidance on
how to appeal, and attaches the applicable rules and procedures.258

The appeal must be lodged within 42 days from the date the written
judgment was sent to the parties or in some circumstances, within 42
days of when the written reasons were sent. EAT procedure is not
within the scope of this book.
20.244
The EAT will ‘sift’ the Notice of Appeal to see whether there are
reasonable grounds for the appeal and whether some or all of the
grounds should be allowed to go ahead to the full hearing. There are
various permutations for how the appeal might then be processed.
Appeals against ET interim orders will be fast-tracked.
20.245
Employees often cannot understand that they may not automatically
appeal when they lose. An appeal to the EAT is not a fresh rehearing
of the entire case. It is a legal argument between the representatives
for each party (or unrepresented litigants), largely based on the
pleadings and the ET’s decision on the facts. The ET’s notes of oral
evidence are not normally looked at by the EAT. The appeal is
confined to errors of law. Where there is no legal error, the claimant
must show that the ET’s decision on the factual evidence was legally
perverse, ie that no reasonable ET could possibly have come to the
same decision. The EAT has described this as the type of decision
which would ‘provoke astonished gasps from the amazed
observer’.259 It is very hard to show this and the EAT is reluctant to
interfere with the ET’s general discretion.

Costs

Overview
20.246 How much of a risk are costs? Unlike most civil courts, the ET does

not usually order that the unsuccessful party pays the costs of the
winner. However, in certain circumstances the ET may order costs,
usually because a party is running or defending a hopeless case, or
because s/he fails to comply with tribunal orders, or because s/he
behaves badly in conducting the case or because his/her poor case
preparation leads to unnecessary postponements or adjournments of
the hearing. The ‘paying party’ is the one who is ordered to pay costs
and the ‘receiving party’ is the one to whom costs are paid. Costs
orders (expenses orders in Scotland) can be made only for costs
incurred while the receiving party was legally represented or
represented by a lay representative.260 ‘Legally represented’ means
having the assistance of someone who has a right of audience in
county courts, magistrates’ courts or any part of the Senior Courts of
England and Wales or who is an advocate or solicitor in Scotland, or
a member of the Bar of Northern Ireland or a solicitor of the Court of
Judicature there.261 A qualified solicitor without a practising
certificate would not constitute a legal representative.262 Nor would
the costs of a non-legal representative be paid simply because s/he
had instructed a barrister who did constitute a legal representative
(although the costs of the barrister can be paid).263 It does not matter
if the legal representative is employed by the receiving party. A ‘lay
representative’ means having the assistance of someone who is not a
legal representative but who charges for representation in the
proceedings. If the receiving party was not legally represented, a
preparation time order may be made instead.264 A costs order and a
preparation time order cannot both be made in favour of the same
party in the same proceedings.265 Wasted costs orders can also be
made personally against some representatives.266
20.247
A tribunal can order a respondent to pay the claimant’s costs
where s/he has not incurred them personally, but they have been
incurred by a law centre acting on her behalf.267 This is because
‘costs’ are explicitly described in the rules as those incurred by ‘or

on behalf of’ the receiving party. Following this logic, it may also be
possible for costs to be ordered in favour of the claimant where
his/her case was paid for by another organisation such as the EHRC
or a trade union. However, this is untested under the 2013 rules.
20.248
To put costs in context, in 2019/20, ETs made 130 costs awards
against claimants. This is a small proportion of the total number of
cases dealt with. Of those awards, 60 were in the range £800–
£4,000, and 21 were over £10,000. In that time, 47 awards were
made against respondents, although generally for much lower
sums.268

Costs orders
20.249 The ET can order a party (called ‘the paying party’) to make a

payment in respect of costs incurred by the other party (‘the
receiving party’). ‘Costs’ include the legal fees, disbursements and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the receiving party while
legally represented or represented by a lay representative.269 The ET
has a discretion to award costs (or make a preparation time order)
and must consider whether to do so where it considers that any of the
following apply:
•

The claim or response had no reasonable prospect of success.270

•

The paying party, or his/her representative, has acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or
otherwise unreasonably in bringing the proceedings or part of them.271

•

The paying party, or his/her representative, has acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or
otherwise unreasonably in the way the proceedings or part of them have been
conducted.272

•

A party has not complied with an order or practice direction.273

•

A full or interim hearing is postponed or adjourned at the request of the paying party.274

•

In an unfair dismissal claim where the claimant told the employer of his/her wish to be
reinstated or re-engaged at least seven days before the hearing, if the hearing is postponed
or adjourned as a result of the employer’s failure, without special reason, to produce
reasonable evidence about the availability of the job from which the claimant was dismissed
or about comparable or suitable employment. In these circumstances, the costs incurred as
a result of the postponement or adjournment must be awarded.275

The tribunal can also make a costs order for witness expenses. Note
that costs cannot be awarded against an employer just because the
employer acted extremely unfairly in dismissing the claimant.276 The
respondent organisation must have been unreasonable in the way it
conducted the case or the response must have had no reasonable
prospect of success. These are not necessarily the same thing.277
20.250
The tribunal must first decide whether any of these categories
apply; and second, decide whether to use its discretion to award
costs and if so, how much to award.278 The fact that a party was
unrepresented may be relevant both to whether the categories apply
(eg has s/he been unreasonable?) and whether costs ought in the
circumstances to be awarded.279 It may be relevant that a person
representing him/herself is likely to lack the objectivity and
knowledge of law and practice brought by a professional legal
adviser. However, parties are not immune from costs just because
they are representing themselves. They may be found to have acted
unreasonably even when proper allowance is made.280
20.251
There is a greater risk now than in the past that costs will be
awarded against a claimant, whether represented or not.
Nevertheless, if a case is run properly, tribunal orders and hearing
dates are adhered to, and the case is reasonably arguable, it is
unlikely that costs will be awarded. Many of the reported cases
where costs have been awarded seem to involve highly
unsympathetic and sometimes vindictive behaviour by the claimants
(although that may just have been the tribunal’s interpretation). Even
so, the fact that a tribunal has decided, on the balance of
probabilities, that the claimant was not telling the truth about a
central plank of his/her claim does not automatically mean that costs
will be ordered against him/her.281 Costs are also a big risk where a
case is really hopeless and the claimant persistently ignores advice
and warnings. If a letter threatening costs is written by the employer
to the claimant, it may increase the risk of costs being awarded if the
case is patently very weak and the employer’s letter clearly explains
to the claimant in a way s/he can understand why it has no reasonable
prospects of success and the amount of unwarranted expense which

is being caused. A claimant in this situation should take – and listen
to – specialist advice. Having said that, employees should certainly
not be intimidated out of running legitimate cases because of fear of
costs or letters routinely sent by some employers’ solicitors
threatening costs, even when there is a perfectly arguable case. The
Court of Appeal has firmly stated that costs awards remain
exceptional in ET proceedings.282
20.252
Costs should not be lightly awarded against the claimant for being
‘unreasonable’ in bringing the claim. The ET rules place a high
threshold on the award of costs, and ‘unreasonable’ should be
interpreted in the context of the other words in that rule.283 The fact
that the claimant’s case is relatively weak, does not necessarily mean
it is unreasonable or has no reasonable prospect of success, although
it is obviously important to be very careful. If faced with a costs
application against the claimant at the end of a case which s/he has
lost, it is important to explain why the case previously appeared to
have reasonable prospects of success. It is worth referring to these
comments from the case of E T Marler Ltd v Robertson:284
‘Ordinary experience of life frequently teaches us that that which is
plain for all to see once the dust of battle has subsided was far from
clear to the contestants when they took up arms.’ Where a case seems
reasonable at the outset, but its weaknesses emerge during
preparation, costs should only be awarded from the point when it
becomes apparent that there is no reasonable prospect of success or
from when the claimant’s behaviour becomes unreasonable.285
20.253
It is unwise to lodge an extremely weak case in the tribunal, in the
hope that the employer will make a settlement offer and with the
intention of withdrawing before the hearing if no offer is
forthcoming. The employer would be able to apply for costs for an
unreasonable case having been started and conducted up to the date
of withdrawal. On the other hand, if the claimant runs a reasonable
case and withdraws for good reasons, costs should not be awarded
just because s/he has withdrawn. The question is not whether the
withdrawal of the claim is in itself unreasonable, but whether, in all
the circumstances of the case, the employee has conducted the

proceedings unreasonably.286 Withdrawal can lead to costs savings
and it would be unfortunate if claimants were deterred from dropping
claims because of a fear of costs ordered due to the withdrawal.287
20.254
The ET can order the claimant to pay some or all of the
employer’s costs (or vice versa). Costs awarded are not confined to
those incurred by the employer as a result of the claimant’s
conduct.288 The nature, gravity and effect of the claimant’s conduct
are all relevant factors.289 The aim is compensation of the party
which has incurred expense in winning the case, not punishment of
the losing party.290 While there does not have to be a precise causal
relationship between the unreasonable conduct and the costs
claimed, any award of costs must, at least broadly, reflect the effect
of the conduct in question.291 Costs should only be awarded on an
‘indemnity’ basis in very rare cases.292
20.255
The ET can order costs up to £20,000 without a detailed
assessment being made. Alternatively, whether or not costs are likely
to exceed £20,000, the ET can order that all – or a specified part –
of the receiving party’s costs are paid, with the amount to be
assessed by a county court in accordance with the CPR 1998 or in
Scotland, ‘taxation’ can be done by a court auditor, or by an
employment judge applying the same principles.293 The ET can apply
a cap to the costs award before referring it for detailed
assessment.294 It is also possible for the parties to agree the amount
of costs. Claimants may find it worrying that the ET can order costs
as high as £20,000 without detailed assessment. Even in such cases,
however, employers are usually required to provide in advance an
itemised schedule as to how the costs were incurred. Legal costs
should be broken down by the standing and hourly rate of each fee
earner and the type of activity, eg telephone, meetings, letters in and
out, documents read. The paying party should not be ordered to pay
the VAT element on counsel’s fees if the receiving party is registered
for VAT and could reclaim it as input tax.295 Where the receiving
party is represented by a ‘lay representative’, the hourly rate payable
under a costs order is no higher than that for a preparation time order
(see below).296 However, it still falls under the category of a ‘costs’

order so the tribunal can order costs in respect of the hearing as well
as preparation time.
20.256
The ET may choose to take into account a party’s ability to pay
when considering whether to make a costs order or preparation time
order, and if so, in deciding how much to order.297 The ET should
probably raise the question of the claimant’s means itself,298 but in
any event, it is sensible for the claimant to ask the ET to consider
his/her means and come prepared with evidence as to what these are,
eg bank statements, evidence of rent or mortgage payments, regular
outgoings, payslips from any new job or benefit statements. The ET
should consider the effect of a very large costs order, eg where the
claimant might have to sell his/her house where s/he lives with
dependent children.299 The ET should give brief reasons as to how
and why ability to pay has affected its decision on costs.300 The ET
can also take account of the fact that the claimant is represented by a
trade union which is likely to pay any costs awarded against its
members.301
20.257
A party can apply for costs at any time during the proceedings. The
application can be made by writing to the tribunal or orally, at the
end of a hearing. An application cannot generally be made later than
28 days from the date the final judgment in the case (which may be a
remedy judgment if the claimant was successful) was sent to the
parties.302 The paying party must be given a reasonable chance to
comment in writing or at a hearing before any order is made against
him/her.303 If costs are awarded against the claimant, s/he is entitled
to written reasons for the costs order, provided s/he requests the
reasons within 14 days of the date the tribunal sends the judgment on
costs.304 The reason and basis for the costs order should be clearly
specified by the ET, particularly when a substantial sum (in the
thousands) is awarded305 and the ET must explain how it calculated
the costs.306
20.258
Although there is an occasionally used procedure for taking a costs
deposit from a party where a case has little reasonable prospect of
success,307 costs may be awarded as set out above regardless of
whether a deposit was ever required or even applied for.

Nevertheless, if a deposit was ordered and the party has lost, s/he is
at greater risk of a costs award. If the case is lost for substantially
the same reasons given in the deposit order, the party will be
considered unreasonable in continuing with the claim or response
unless proved otherwise.308 However, the tribunal still has the usual
discretion as to whether to award costs and must consider all the
circumstances.309
20.259
Usually settlement negotiations are ‘without prejudice’, ie off the
record as far as the ET is concerned.310 However, some employers
write a letter headed ‘without prejudice save as to costs’ or a
completely open letter offering a certain sum. They threaten to draw
this to the attention of the ET on the question of costs should the
claimant lose, or win and get a lesser award. Such letters are
adapted from civil court practice, where costs are routinely
awarded, and are known as ‘Calderbank offers’. The EAT has said
they have no place in the ET system. However, general intransigence
or pressing for an unreasonably high award after its excessiveness
has been pointed out could amount to unreasonable behaviour and
lead to costs.311 The EAT has said in the past that an employee has an
absolute right to have his/her unfair dismissal claim decided and an
ET therefore should not award costs simply because the claimant has
turned down an open offer of compensation which turns out to equal
or exceed the eventual ET award.312 The position may be different if
the employer concedes unfair dismissal. There is some contradiction
between this principle and the more recent cases mentioned above
considering Calderbank offers. Overall, the safest approach is for
the claimant to be seen to take a reasonable approach in running the
case and in his/her approach to negotiations; there may be a
difference between a reasonable unwillingness to settle at all unless
unfairness is admitted, and a willingness to settle, but only for
ridiculous figures.

Preparation time orders
20.260 A tribunal can make a preparation time order that the paying party

makes a payment in respect of the preparation time of another party.
An order may be made for preparation time spent by the receiving
party (including its employees or advisers) while it was not legally
represented.313 It applies to time spent working on the case, except
for time spent at any final hearing. The ET will assess the number of
hours spent on preparation, based on its estimate of a reasonable and
proportionate time to have spent on the particular case, given its
complexity and the number of witnesses and documents, and
information on time spent provided by the party claiming costs.314
The hourly rate goes up by £1 annually each year on 6 April. In the
year starting 6 April 2021, it was £41/hour. The grounds for making
a preparation time order, principles applicable and procedures
followed are otherwise the same as for costs awards (para 20.249
onwards). As already stated, orders for witness expenses fall under
the category of ‘costs’ orders (see below).
20.261
Preparation time orders are intended to acknowledge the cost of
tribunals to unrepresented parties and not-for-profit representatives.
However, it is a lesser entitlement, both in terms of the hourly rate,
and the fact that it excludes time at the hearing itself.

Wasted costs orders against representatives
20.262 An ET can order a representative to pay all or part of the wasted

costs of any party and/or witness expenses, if these have been
incurred as a result of any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or
omission by the representative.315 An order can also be made where
the ET thinks it unreasonable to expect the receiving party to pay
costs in the light of any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or
omission by the representative occurring after the costs were

incurred. These costs are known as ‘wasted costs’. It seems that the
ET must itself assess the amount of costs awarded and unlike in the
case of ordinary costs or preparation time orders, cannot refer large
sums to the county court or Sheriff Court for assessment.316
20.263
It must be fair to make such an order and a high level of
misconduct is required, not simply running a hopeless case or acting
unreasonably or negligently in the normal way, but having lent
assistance to proceedings which amount to an abuse of the court.317
This is partly because, due to the confidentiality of communications
between a lawyer and his/her client, it can be hard to establish how
much the lawyer had been told and how much of the decision-making
was down to him/her. If privilege is not waived by the represented
party, the tribunal may well not have the necessary evidence to
decide if the representative acted negligently and whether the
representative’s actions (as opposed to the party’s) caused
unnecessary costs.318 Orders can be made against legal and non-legal
representatives, but not against a representative who is an employee
of a party, eg the employer is represented by an in-house solicitor or
human resources (HR) manager.319 A wasted costs order cannot be
made against a representative who is not acting for profit with regard
to the proceedings, eg a law centre or trade union representative.
However, orders can be made against representatives acting on a
contingency or conditional fee arrangement (‘no win, no fee’). A
wasted costs order can even be made requiring a representative to
pay wasted costs to his/her own client.320
20.264
A wasted costs order can be made by the ET on its own initiative
or on the application of any party. A party can apply at any stage up
to 28 days after the final judgment (including any remedy) was sent
to the parties.321 The ET must give the representative a reasonable
opportunity to comment in writing or at a hearing before making an
order and may take account of his/her ability to pay.322

Witness expenses
20.265 The government no longer reimburses witnesses for their expenses.

The 2013 rules state that a ‘costs order’ can be made which requires

the claimant or respondent to pay the other party or to pay a witness
directly in respect of ‘expenses’ that have been or will be incurred in
connection with an individual’s attendance as a witness at the ET.323
It is uncertain whether ‘expenses’ simply means matters such as fares
and if necessary, overnight accommodation, or whether it also
includes any loss of earnings.
20.266
An ET can make such an order on its own initiative or on the
application of a party or the witness him/herself where a witness has
attended or has been ordered to attend to give oral evidence at a
hearing.324 It is not necessary for any of the other grounds for making
a costs order to apply, eg that the paying party has acted vexatiously
or unreasonably or that his/her case had no reasonable prospect of
success. The ET can order a party to pay for his/her own witness or
for a witness called by the other party.
20.267
There is no case-law authority regarding the basis on which
tribunals should make costs orders in favour of witnesses. Factors
taken into account may be the relevance of the witness’s evidence;
whether the other side could have agreed rather than disputed the
evidence; and the overall strength of the case. It is uncertain whether
the cost to the witness will also be a relevant factor in deciding
whether an order should be made. In particular, whether the paying
party caused the witness unnecessary expense, eg by requiring
him/her to attend the entire hearing rather than fixing a particular time
for his/her evidence (though the latter would need to be with the
agreement of the ET and the other side).

Settlement
ACAS, settlement agreements and consent orders
20.268 As an entirely separate matter

from early conciliation (see para
20.16) an ACAS officer is attached to most ET claims, including all
unfair dismissal or discrimination claims, and has a statutory duty to
promote a settlement. The ACAS officer usually contacts each party
by letter or telephone and the claimant can choose whether to use
him/her as an intermediary or negotiate direct with the employer.

Communications to an ACAS officer are not admissible in evidence
before the ET, unless the parties expressly agree.325 Most settlements
do not take place until each side has a better idea of the strengths of
their case following the stages of case preparation. Many settlements
occur shortly before the hearing. The role of ACAS is usually
referred to as ‘conciliation’ and the ACAS officer is a ‘conciliation
officer’. In recent years, the option of ‘mediation’ has been
introduced, either through ACAS or independent mediators, or
judicial mediation through the tribunal. As this is most suited to
discrimination claims, it is discussed in more detail at para 21.53.
20.269
The ACAS officer has no duty to see that the terms of a settlement
are fair and must not advise on the merits of the claim.326 There is
therefore no need to enter into a discussion about the evidence and it
is best to focus on issues of compensation. There is a risk that what
is said to ACAS about the claimant’s case may be passed on to the
employer’s representative. Remember that the ACAS officer’s job is
to encourage settlement – it is not to worry about whether the
claimant has secured a good deal. There are many advantages in
settling a claim, as it avoids the risk of losing, the unpleasantness of
the hearing, the operation of the recoupment provisions and may be
the only way to negotiate a good reference.
20.270
A settlement agreement reached through ACAS is recorded on a
COT3 form and signed, but it is binding and effective as soon as it is
verbally agreed, even if the form is never later signed.327 It is
essential to have clear instructions from the claimant on whether to
settle and on what terms and to be absolutely clear to ACAS when
any discussion is subject to final confirmation. The COT3 form is
used to record the settlement terms and is signed by the claimant and
respondent or their representatives. ACAS will not normally rubberstamp a settlement if reached in direct negotiation with the
employer’s representative, but will accept some direct
communications are necessary to clarify or hurry things along. Once
there is a COT3 settlement, the ACAS officer notifies the ET. If the
hearing date is very close, check that ACAS has done this and it may

even be wise to write to the ET to confirm that an ACAS settlement
has been reached.
20.271
Once the tribunal has been notified of a settlement, it sends out a
letter stating that it has updated its records and closed its file; the file
is kept in archive for one year and then destroyed. The tribunal may
not issue an order or judgment in these circumstances. Many
employers’ representatives are uncomfortable with this and therefore
insist on it being part of the settlement terms that the claimant writes
to the tribunal asking for his/her case to be withdrawn. The ET will
then issue a judgment dismissing the proceedings. This means the
claimant cannot try to issue new proceedings against the employer on
essentially the same point. There are two exceptions. First the ET
will not dismiss the proceedings if the claimant explicitly reserved
the right to bring a further claim on substantially the same matter and
had a legitimate reason to do so. This is unusual but it can happen, eg
the claimant accidentally made a notice claim in excess of the
maximum an ET can award and wanted to withdraw and reissue in
the civil courts. Second, the ET also will not automatically dismiss
the claim following withdrawal if it believes it would not be in the
interests of justice to do so.328
20.272
The important point is that the claimant does not agree to
withdraw the claim until after the employer has paid the settlement
sum. For example, ‘the claimant undertakes to write to the tribunal
withdrawing the claim within seven days of payment of the
settlement sum and meanwhile, the case is adjourned generally’. This
preserves the claimant’s right to reopen the case if the employer does
not pay, or to sue for the agreed sum, whichever s/he thinks will most
effectively secure him/her the money. Some employers offer to pay
only because they cannot face the idea of a tribunal hearing, but have
no intention of actually paying up. The possibility of reopening the
case can be important to make such employers honour the settlement.
20.273
Usually a settlement is not binding in respect of ET claims unless
it is agreed through ACAS. However, ACAS need not be involved
where a ‘settlement agreement’ is reached directly between the
parties. This may happen before or after ET proceedings have been

launched. A ‘settlement agreement’ is a written agreement which
relates to the employee’s complaint before the ET and states that the
employee has received independent advice from a qualified lawyer
(a solicitor holding a practising certificate or a barrister who is
covered by professional indemnity insurance), a legal executive,
officers, officials or employees of an independent trade union who
have been certified by the trade union as competent to give advice or
an advice centre employee or volunteer who has been certified as
competent to give advice. In these circumstances it will be a binding
settlement.329 A ‘settlement agreement’ used to be called a
‘compromise agreement’ which was useful, because it distinguished
it from ordinary agreements to settle which did not follow the
procedural requirements.
20.274
If a settlement is reached at the tribunal, eg on the morning of the
hearing, it is important to get it validly written out and signed on the
spot. If there are the appropriate representatives, a settlement
agreement could be drafted. If not, an ordinary signed agreement
could be made, although the employer is unlikely to find this
satisfactory. Another option is to ask the tribunal to make a judgment
by consent.330 The parties should write out the agreed terms, sign
them and ask the tribunal to make an order. There are two ways to do
this – either the terms are set out fully in the tribunal’s order; or they
are set out in a schedule which is attached to the order. The latter
option is preferable as it can contain matters outside the tribunal’s
jurisdiction, eg agreement to provide a reference, and it should avoid
any risk of recoupment.
20.275
The tribunal should then be asked to make a decision that the claim
is ‘stayed’ (or ‘adjourned’) pending payment. As explained above,
this means the claimant can ask for the hearing to be refixed if the
employer fails to pay and it maintains the incentive on the employer
to comply with the settlement terms. Otherwise, the claimant’s only
option will be to pursue enforcement through the civil courts.331
Typical wording for the order could be:
Terms of settlement having been agreed between the parties, the claim is stayed against
the respondent. Liberty for the claimant to restore on or before (date)332 and if no

application is received by that date, the claim is dismissed against the respondent upon
withdrawal by the claimant.

If the claimant is confident that the employer is willing and
financially able to pay, s/he may be prepared to agree immediate
withdrawal. Wording then could be:
Terms of settlement having been agreed between the parties (as annexed), the claim in
case number (insert) is dismissed on withdrawal by the claimant.

Of course, the actual terms of settlement also need to be written out
and the clerk can be asked to make copies for the tribunal and each
party.

The settlement terms
20.276 Care

should be taken that the employee fully understands the
implications and meaning of any settlement before an agreement is
concluded. If possible, only the particular ET claim should be
settled. In practice, many employers insist on a wider settlement, ie
that in return for payment of the specified sum, the employee waives
any other claim arising out of the contract of employment or its
termination. Settlement agreements (although not necessarily COT3s)
must precisely itemise the claims to be settled and may not be
effective to exclude potential complaints which have not yet arisen
or been discussed in any way.333 As well as explaining to the
claimant precisely what a ‘full and final’ settlement means, it is
safest to ask explicitly whether money is owing, eg in respect of
wages, bonuses and commission, notice pay or holiday pay. Ask
about the claimant’s health and whether s/he has had any accidents at
work. Whatever his/her reply, there should be an express exclusion
for any personal injury (PI) or industrial injury claims.334 If there
seems to be a potential PI claim, the claimant should get advice on
this before concluding a settlement. This is because the exclusion
may not be sufficient to safeguard his/her right to bring such a claim
or the employer may refuse to agree such an exclusion or to exclude
any potential PI claims of which the claimant is aware at the time of

settlement. It may also be possible to do a global settlement
including the value of the PI claim. In addition, there should be an
explicit exception for pension rights. ACAS officers often suggest the
PI and pension exclusions in their standard wording. If the employer
had also made a contract claim against the claimant, this needs to be
included in the settlement. Otherwise it may continue even if the
claimant settles or withdraws his/her own contract claim.
20.277
If the employer wants a confidentiality clause (sometimes known
as an ‘NDA’ – non-disclosure agreement), exactly what needs to be
kept confidential needs to be described, plus any necessary
exceptions regarding who the claimant can tell. ACAS has published
guidance on non-disclosure agreements, which discourages their
routine use.335
20.278
It is advisable to specify in the COT3 or settlement agreement a
date for payment. The actual wording of an agreed reference should
be incorporated, as well as the basis on which it will be supplied.336
The following considerations should be taken into account:
•

Does the claimant wish to ask for an open (‘to whom it may concern’) reference as well
as asking the employer to write a reference in the agreed terms on request?

•

Does the claimant wish to suggest that if the employer is asked for a verbal reference, s/he
will only provide a written reference, or that s/he will respond verbally with the same
content and spirit and without addition?

•

Does the claimant wish to suggest that if the employer is asked for a reference which asks
specific questions, s/he may not answer at all, or s/he may answer if asked, or only with the
claimant’s prior written consent, or that s/he will answer with the same spirit and content as
the agreed terms and without addition? What should the employer say if asked for more
information?

•

It should be specified that the reference will be supplied on headed notepaper and duly
signed and dated. The claimant may wish to specify who should or who should not deal
with reference requests.

It should be remembered that an employer cannot be asked to lie in a
reference and can only be controlled so far. Often it is important to
preserve some remnants of goodwill to improve the chances of fair
behaviour in response to reference requests. Alternatively, it may

focus the employer’s mind, if s/he has asked for confidentiality, for
example, to state that if the spirit or content of the reference
agreement is not adhered to, then the claimant will no longer be
bound by confidentiality.
20.279
The employers may propose a lengthy and complex settlement
agreement with onerous and unsuitable terms. It is essential to
understand what these mean and to ensure that the claimant
understands and consents.337 A claimant also needs to be advised of
any tax implications and of the effect of receiving a lump sum on any
benefits currently claimed. The tax position on settlements may not
be straightforward and is entirely beyond the scope of this book.
Advisers should seek specialist advice where it is an issue.338 The
following is a very general summary which provides the gist of the
tax regime, but does not cover every aspect and does not go into the
finer details, exceptions and pitfalls:
•

Termination payments, eg for unfair dismissal or for a discriminatory dismissal, are taxable
as such. As long as no element of the payment is taxable under any other rules, there is a
£30,000 exemption.339

•

Some parts of a settlement sum may comprise contractual earnings which are owed, eg
outstanding wages or holiday pay, which would be taxable in any event.

•

For dismissals after 6 April 2018, if the employee is dismissed without notice or pay in lieu,
and subsequently receives a large termination payment, HM Revenue & Customs
(HMRC) is likely to view that payment as including notice, and to tax that element.340

•

If, under the settlement agreement, the employer pays the employee’s genuine legal
expenses direct to the employee’s solicitors, this payment should not be taxable.

•

Regarding tax on injury to feelings, see para 19.12.

•

Employers sometimes seek indemnities in respect of any tax which unexpectedly later
becomes due. If the claimant is in a strong position, s/he should insist that the employer
bears the risk of unforeseen tax. If the claimant does agree to provide an indemnity, this
certainly should not include an agreement to cover any tax penalties, interest or fines,
resulting from the employer’s default or slowness in dealing with the matter, or the
employer’s costs in dealing with HMRC, and the claimant should reserve his/her right to
make representations or challenge any liability or assessment with HMRC before the
employer pays it.

The procedure for running a discrimination case is basically the
same as that for running an unfair dismissal case, but with
greater emphasis on obtaining evidence. The Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) early conciliation
(EC) applies, just as it does for unfair dismissal.
For many years there was a very important statutory
questionnaire procedure. This was replaced by a non-statutory
scheme supported by an ACAS Code. Without statutory
questionnaires, workers need to think more carefully about
how to obtain the necessary evidence.
There are strict time limits for starting a discrimination claim in
the employment tribunal (ET). Where there are several acts of
discrimination or different legal claims, it is essential to think
separately about the time limit and possible extension for each
individual claim, as these may vary.
Claims can be brought against individual discriminators as well
as against the employer.
Preliminary hearings are usually held in discrimination cases to
deal with case management orders, eg what additional
information and disclosure is needed. The discussions can be
tricky to handle and it is important to be well-prepared.
The ET can make orders in discrimination and other cases to
prevent or restrict public disclosure of the names of parties or
witnesses or certain allegations where necessary in the
interests of justice or to protect rights to privacy etc. However,
the powerful principle of open justice limits what an ET can
agree to do.
The ET should be informed of and accommodate accessibility
issues affecting any disabled party, witness or representative.
This applies to all types of tribunal case, not just
discrimination.

The claimant usually gives evidence first in a discrimination
case. S/he should be prepared for aggressive crossexamination by the respondent’s representative.

Introduction
21.1

In running discrimination cases, the basic principles are similar to
those for unfair dismissal, including the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) early conciliation (EC), dealt with in
chapter 20 above. This chapter, which should be read in conjunction
with chapter 20, highlights the procedural and technical differences
that arise in cases under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010. In addition,
where the worker intends to claim compensation for injury to health
or needs to prove s/he is disabled for a disability discrimination
claim, s/he may need to obtain medical evidence at an early stage
(see chapter 16). A person bringing a case is referred to as a
‘claimant’. The employer or individual against whom a case is
brought is called the ‘respondent’.

ACAS early conciliation
21.2

ACAS EC applies to discrimination claims. The rules are set out at
paras 20.20–20.27 above. In summary, a claimant must make an EC
notification to ACAS and obtain a certificate before s/he can present
a tribunal claim. EC affects time limits (see para 20.56 onwards). In
effect, a claimant must notify ACAS before the end of the tribunal
time limit. S/he must then submit his/her tribunal claim within the
required time after the ACAS certificate. The following explanation
of tribunal time limits should be read with this in mind.

The tribunal claim (ET1)
The time limit

Overview
21.3

21.4

The ET1 tribunal claim must be presented within three months of the
act of discrimination – ie, the last day for presentation is three
calendar months less one day from the discriminatory act.1 For
example, if the discrimination happened on 5 May, the deadline is 4
August. Earlier incidents can be referred to as supporting evidence.2
If the claimant is still employed when s/he started the tribunal case
and further discrimination takes place after that, in theory it should
be possible to amend the original ET1 to add the later claims.3
However, it is probably safer to submit a new ET1 within the time
limit and ask for the two cases to be considered together. Having
said that, in this situation, the claimant does need to keep a sense of
proportion. Submitting the first ET1 may well have upset both the
claimant and the employer, and it is easy for the claimant
subsequently to become discontented with every unfairness in the
workplace. It would not be sensible for a claimant to keep submitting
fresh ET1s unless very serious further adverse actions have been
carried out, which the claimant can prove are discriminatory.
Otherwise, the effect of continually submitting ET1s is likely to
destroy the workplace relationship and confuse the major issues in
the case.
The act of discrimination is not always easy to identify, so
advisers must be alert about time limits. Time usually runs from
when a decision not to promote or appoint is made (not when it is
communicated),4 or from when a warning is given, and not from the
end of any appeal or grievance procedure. However, if the failure of
the grievance procedure or appeal was itself because of race,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, age or related to disability, then that
is a further act of discrimination from which another three-month
period runs. It is unwise to rely on this to extend time, as usually it is
the original action which constituted the discrimination, not the
decision on appeal or grievance, which tends to be a rubberstamping exercise. Therefore, if there is a lengthy appeal or
grievance process, it is important not to allow the original incident to
fall out of time.

21.5

21.6

21.7

In some situations, discrimination continues over a period of time,
sometimes up to the date of leaving employment. The time for
submitting an ET1 then runs from the end of that period.5 The
common, although technically inaccurate, name for this is ‘continuing
discrimination’. A disciplinary suspension is considered an act
extending over a period of time, and a suspension linked with
disciplinary proceedings should be viewed as a whole.6 Similarly,
the time-limit on a discriminatory decision to instigate disciplinary
proceedings may well not start to run until the disciplinary decision
is made.7
Advisers should be careful if relying on showing continuing
discrimination for time limit purposes as it is sometimes hard to
distinguish it from a single act of discrimination with continuing
effects. For example, a failed promotion attempt resulting in
continued employment at a lower grade and wage is not in itself
continuing discrimination.8 If a worker is out of time, s/he should
make another attempt at promotion on which it may be appropriate to
base a claim provided this latest failure also appears discriminatory
on the facts. On the other hand, if an employer maintained a
conscious or unconscious rule that only workers of a particular race
or sex would be promoted to certain posts, that would be continuing
discrimination.
In Calder v James Finlay Corporation Ltd,9 a woman was twice
refused a mortgage subsidy from her employer which was available
to men. The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) said that although
the unsuccessful requests took place more than three months prior to
her claim, the rules of the scheme barring women constituted a
discriminatory act extending throughout Mrs Calder’s employment
until she left. Similarly, in Barclays Bank v Kapur,10 the employer
kept in force ‘a discriminatory regime’ throughout the workers’
employment in that their past service in banks in Africa was not
credited towards their pensionable service. The ET had jurisdiction
to hear the claim even though the workers entered the discriminatory
scheme several years earlier, which was when the decision not to
include their service was taken.

21.8

21.9

21.10

The Calder and Kapur cases concerned formal rules which
remained in place and were discriminatory. This principle was taken
further in Owusu v London Fire and Civil Defence Authority.11 Mr
Owusu, a clerical worker, complained of the failure to re-grade him
at any stage since his transfer several years earlier and the failure to
let him act-up when such opportunities arose (all of which had arisen
more than three months before he lodged his tribunal claim). The
EAT accepted there could be a continuing act of discrimination if Mr
Owusu proved a discriminatory policy, rule or practice (however
informal) which, when followed or applied, excluded him from regrading or acting-up opportunities. However, it would be necessary
to prove a linking practice as opposed to a series of one-off
decisions, even if they were each discriminatory.
The Owusu case was approved of by the Court of Appeal in Cast
v Croydon College,12 which confirmed that there could be a
continuing policy or regime, even if it was not formal or written, and
even if it was only confined to one post or role. Mrs Cast asked her
line manager before she went on maternity leave whether she could
return to work afterwards on a part-time or job-share basis. He
refused, even though the college had a written policy generally
receptive to job-sharing at all levels. Mrs Cast unsuccessfully
repeated her request to her manager twice after her return. A few
months later she resigned. Subsequently she lodged her ET claim.
The ET said that the time limit was three months from the first
refusal, before Mrs Cast even went on maternity leave. Mrs Cast’s
claim was therefore well out of time. The Court of Appeal
disagreed. It said that the several refusals of Mrs Cast’s request
indicated the existence of a discriminatory policy in relation to her
post (manager of the college’s information centre). This policy
continued until Mrs Cast left and her claim was therefore in time,
regardless of the date of any particular request and refusal.
The Court of Appeal also considered the position if there had not
been a continuing policy or practice, but simply a succession of
independent refusals. Any refusal within the last three months would
be in time provided it was the result of a fresh consideration by the

21.11

21.12

21.13

employer (even if it was a decision made by the same manager and
on the same facts). On the other hand, if the manager simply referred
back to his previous decision or expanded on his reasons, this would
not be a fresh consideration, and time would run from the earlier
decision. Mrs Cast therefore had an alternative argument that the time
limit should be counted from the last (and not the first) of her line
manager’s refusals.13
The most useful case of all is Hendricks v Commissioner of
Police for the Metropolis,14 where the Court of Appeal further
extended the Owusu principle. It said a worker need not be restricted
to proving a discriminatory policy, rule, regime or practice, if s/he
could show that a sequence of individual incidents were evidence of
a ‘continuing discriminatory state of affairs’. In other words, Ms
Hendricks must prove a general link between the incidents so that
they amounted to ‘an act of discrimination extending over a period’,
as opposed to a succession of unconnected and isolated specific acts.
Her case was in fact unusual and extreme. She was complaining of
nearly 100 incidents of bullying and harassment by a large number of
colleagues over an 11-year period and ongoing discrimination by
management in failing to give support and unjust appraisals. If there
is continuing discrimination, the continuing act is not broken by
absences, eg on holiday or maternity leave during which nothing
happens.15
A close sequence of discriminatory actions, eg a series of threats,
warnings and abuse, as is common in harassment cases, may well
constitute continuing discrimination in the legal sense, although to be
safe the ET claim should be submitted within three months of each
incident. In practice, it is usually enough if the most serious incidents
(and those easiest to prove) are in time. The other actions can still be
referred to as supporting evidence. Alternatively, the ET could be
asked to exercise its discretion to allow in late claims.
In sexual harassment cases, time limits are often missed because,
for example, the worker goes off sick and then resigns. No further
acts of discrimination are likely to have occurred during the
worker’s absence, but an adviser may mistakenly calculate the three

21.14

21.15

months from the resignation rather than from the last incident at
work.16 Another trap into which advisers can fall occurs where the
harassment stops once the worker complains, but the employer takes
some time to investigate and the longer-term outcome is
unsatisfactory. By the time the worker realises s/he is unhappy with
the solution, three months may have passed from the harassment
itself.17
A discriminatory act may consist of an omission to do something,
eg failure to promote a worker on racial grounds or failure to make a
reasonable adjustment. A deliberate omission takes place on the date
the discriminator decides on it. In the absence of any evidence to the
contrary, this means the date when the discriminator takes any step
inconsistent with doing the omitted act or otherwise, the date by
which s/he might reasonably have been expected to do the omitted
act.18 This is most likely to come up in disability discrimination
cases, where the worker claims for failure to make reasonable
adjustments. To be safe on time limits, it would be wise to submit
any ET claim within three months of the date when the employer first
refuses to make the required adjustment or, if earlier, when it might
reasonably be expected that the adjustment would have been made. If
in doubt, count the three months from when the employer should first
have become aware of the need for the adjustment. As with a
sequence of discriminatory actions, it is possible for a sequence of
failures to make adjustments to constitute a continuing discriminatory
state of affairs.19 Nevertheless, it is difficult to distinguish a one-off
omission where the need for the adjustment continues, from a
sequence of omissions. It is therefore safer to count the time from
individual omissions as suggested.
The case-law on time limits and on out-of-time claims (below)
shows a reluctance by the higher courts to be rigid about time limits
in discrimination cases. But it can still be a source of major
difficulty in the ETs. Employers tend to argue fiercely that as many
incidents as possible are out of time. Although several of the above
cases may come to the rescue where a worker seems to be out of
time, it is still far easier to run and prove a case where the relevant

21.16

incidents occurred within the last three months. For example, the
concept of continuing discrimination may seem to rescue a situation,
but in fact it is much harder to prove that there is a linking practice,
than that discrimination occurred on separate occasions.
The government has acknowledged that the three-month time limit
is too short for many workers who have experienced the trauma of
sexual harassment and also for many pregnancy discrimination
claims. It has indicated that once normal levels of service are
restored following disruption caused by the pandemic, it will look
closely at extending the time limit for EqA 2010 claims to six
months.20
Claims outside the time limit

21.17

21.18

21.19

An ET may allow a claim outside the time limit if it is just and
equitable to do so.21 This is a wider and therefore more commonly
granted discretion than for unfair dismissal claims. The ET must
weigh up the reasons for and against extending time and explain its
thinking.22 The ET’s approach should be neither ‘strict’ nor ‘liberal’;
it should simply consider all the facts and circumstances.23
For many years, a case called Keeble has been taken to mean that
an ET should go through a checklist based on the requirements of the
Limitation Act 1980 s33. However, the Court of Appeal has now
stated very firmly that this is not a rigid checklist and tribunals only
need to consider the factors which they think are relevant in the
particular case.24 Having said that, two factors are almost always
relevant to consider, ie a) the length and reasons for the delay, and b)
whether the delay has ‘prejudiced’ the employer.
Regarding the reasons for the delay, if the reason is that the
claimant was ignorant of his/her rights, it will be relevant whether
that ignorance was reasonable, and whether it continued to be
reasonable for the whole period during which the claimant was late.
The extent to which the claimant acted promptly and reasonably once
s/he knew whether or not s/he had a legal case is likely to be
relevant. The steps the claimant took to try and get legal advice, and
the nature of the advice s/he received, may also be relevant. A

21.20

21.21

21.22

21.23

21.24
21.25

mistake by the claimant’s legal adviser should not be held against the
claimant25 and appears to be a valid excuse.
It may also be relevant if the employer withheld certain
information or facts from the claimant, especially if the claimant was
asking for certain information to establish whether s/he had a case.
Where the delay is because the claimant first tried to resolve the
matter through use of an internal grievance procedure, this is simply
one consideration for the ET to take into account.26 If the delay was
because the claimant tried to pursue the matter in correspondence
before rushing to an ET, this should also be considered.27
Where the claimant has a mental disability, a tribunal may choose
to take account of the fact that s/he was reluctant to admit to
him/herself that s/he had a disability or that severe depression made
it difficult for him/her to make decisions about taking legal action.28
Having said all that, unlike with late unfair dismissal claims, it is
not necessary to prove it was ‘not reasonably practicable’ to get the
claim in on time. The reason for the lateness is just one factor to be
put into the balance. Although an important factor, the ET should not
refuse to allow in a late claim purely because the claimant has no
good excuse for the lateness.29 As we have said, all relevant factors
should be considered.
Moving on to the effect of the delay, the extent to which the
strength of the evidence of either party might be affected by the delay
will be very relevant. When considering if the employer is
‘prejudiced’ by the delay, the tribunal will look at whether any harm
is done to the employer or to the chances of a fair hearing by the
element of lateness. Has it prevented the employer investigating the
claim while matters were fresh? Was the employer already aware of
the allegation and so not caught by surprise? If an employer says it
has lost documents or a witness, how important is that evidence to
the matters to be decided?
An ET may also take into account the apparent strength of the case.
Where a claim is outside the time limit because a material fact
emerges much later, eg the job for which a black worker applied is
filled several months later by a white person with lesser

21.26

21.27

21.28

qualifications or experience, an ET should consider whether it was
reasonable of the claimant not to realise s/he had enough evidence
until this happened.30 Alternatively, it could be argued that the claim
is not out of time at all because the act of discrimination has not
‘crystallised’, ie finally taken place, until the eventual appointment.31
It is often worth trying to get in an out-of-time claim, if the above
factors are persuasive, as some ETs are prepared to exercise their
discretion favourably. In particular, where there are several
discriminatory acts, with only the most recent in time, the ET may
well grant leave to allow in the earlier acts. This is especially so
where the earlier acts will be raised in the case anyway as matters of
evidence supporting the latest claim.32 In this type of case, the ET1
should be clearly drafted so that it is plain that the earlier
discriminatory acts are meant to be claims in their own right and not
just supporting evidence.
It is also wise expressly to ask permission in the ET1 for the
earlier claims to be allowed in under the ET’s discretion. However,
whether or not this request is made in the ET1 itself, it should be
sought by the claimant’s representative at the very latest at the start of
the hearing. The onus is on the claimant to seek permission. The ET
is not obliged to offer to use its discretion and if nothing is said, the
earlier acts may be treated purely as evidence.33 Frequently,
however, the question will already have been dealt with during the
preparation of the case.
The ET may also order a preliminary hearing to make decisions on
whether part or all of the claim is in time. However, if the one key
incident is in time and the earlier incidents will be heard as evidence
anyway, a preliminary hearing on this may not be very useful as it
will make no difference to the ground covered by the final hearing.34
Also, it is usually very difficult to decide whether continuing
discrimination may be proved without hearing all the evidence,
which cannot be done at a preliminary hearing. The ET is often better
able to decide after it has heard all the evidence at the final hearing
whether to allow in the earlier incidents as claims in themselves.

Drafting the ET1
Overview
21.29

21.30

21.31

21.32

For details regarding the standard forms (ET1) for tribunal claims,
see para 20.60 onwards. At section 9.1 of the standard form, the
claimant is asked to state what compensation or other remedy s/he
wants if s/he is successful. The checklist seemingly does not give the
option of asking for both recommendations and compensation in a
discrimination claim, because it refers to ‘compensation only’. This
is presumably an error. The claimant should tick both ‘compensation
only’ and ‘recommendation’ (assuming s/he wants to keep open the
possibility of both).
At section 8.2 of the current form, the claimant should describe the
incidents (with dates) which s/he believes amounted to
discrimination. It is not enough just to tick the box for discrimination
in section 8.1. For example, if the claimant ticks the box for age
discrimination at 8.1, at the very least, s/he should identify the
alleged discriminatory action and type of discrimination in section
8.2, eg, ‘I was made redundant because I was over 50’ or ‘I was not
promoted because I complained about age discrimination’.
It is very important to be sure about the extent of the worker’s
claim and set it out correctly from the outset. The ET may not allow
any amendments of the ET1 later, especially to add entirely new
grounds.35 Even if the ET does allow later amendments, the original
version of the ET1 will still be visible and any significant changes
will damage the claimant’s credibility. The safest route is to think
through the case and get it right from the outset.
Because discrimination claims do not only cover dismissal, there
may be a large number of employer actions over a period of time
which the claimant feels were discriminatory. The claim form should
make it clear which actions are part of the claim as opposed to
merely supporting evidence. It is sensible to focus on key incidents
which have a reasonable chance of being proved and are suggestive
of discrimination, as opposed to unfairness alone.36 Overloading the

21.33

21.34

21.35

case with too many complaints going back over several years can
weaken a case rather than strengthen it.
If the worker resigned following several discriminatory actions by
the employer, s/he should consider claiming constructive dismissal
(see para 12.22) as well as claiming for each of the acts which s/he
feels were discriminatory. There are good reasons for claiming both.
On the one hand, the constructive dismissal claim may fail for a
technical reason, even if the earlier actions were discrimination. On
the other hand, although compensation for pre-resignation
discriminatory actions could include loss of earnings if the worker
can show they led directly to the resignation, it is a more obvious
award for a constructive dismissal. Also, the constructive dismissal
will usually have taken place at a later date than the matters leading
to the resignation, which can be important in respect of time limits.
If the worker is claiming indirect discrimination or victimisation
as well as direct discrimination, s/he must specify this.37 Equally, if
s/he is complaining of discriminatory treatment during employment
and on dismissal, it needs to be clear whether s/he is saying the
dismissal is some form of discrimination or victimisation, or
whether it is purely an unfair dismissal. As long as the claimant has
clearly described all the relevant facts in a way which makes it clear
what s/he is claiming, s/he should be allowed to amend later to add
the correct legal label. For example, if the claimant wrote on the ET1
that, during a grievance hearing, s/he alleged sex discrimination in
promotion, and that is what led to the subsequent dismissal, s/he
should be able to add the label ‘victimisation’ later. Conversely,
there may be difficulty amending if all the claimant has done is
describe the discriminatory promotion, his/her complaints and the
subsequent dismissal, without making any link.
If victimisation is claimed, the protected act should be cited. In
indirect discrimination claims, because of the uncertainty about
which provision, criterion or practice (PCP), and which pool the ET
will approve, it is probably best to express the claim in broad or
alternative terms.

All key matters on which the claimant will rely should be
mentioned concisely in the tribunal claim with dates. It is important
to include any racist, sexist or similarly offensive remarks based on
other protected characteristics. However, if claimants do omit to
mention historic incidents in their ET1 which provide further
supporting evidence of discrimination, they should not be debarred
from including such evidence for the first time in their witness
statement for the hearing.38 Nevertheless, this is a dangerous strategy
and may lead to an award of costs against them for unreasonable
conduct of the proceedings. If unfair dismissal is being claimed in
addition to discrimination, this should be added in a separate
paragraph specifying in which way the dismissal was unfair, to
clarify that it is recognised as a different issue.39
If the claimant has mentioned an actual comparator in the ET1,
s/he should still reserve the right to argue that s/he has been less
favourably treated than a hypothetical comparator would have
been.40

21.36

21.37

Naming individual respondents
Individuals may be named as respondents in the ET1, as well as the
employing organisation. Remember that ACAS must be notified of
each respondent and needs to have issued a certificate in respect of
each or a single certificate naming more than one respondent.41 It
should be possible to bring a claim purely against an individual,42
but it is rarely done. Apart from anything else, the employer is more
likely to have sufficient funds to pay out any compensation. It is
therefore normal to bring a discrimination claim against the
employer, but whether any individuals are named as additional
respondents depends on several considerations:

21.38

•

Compensation will be awarded equally against the individual and the employing organisation
on a ‘joint and several’ basis.43

•

If the employing organisation might escape liability because the employer took all
reasonable steps to prevent the discrimination happening,44 naming individuals ensures that
the claim succeeds against somebody. This is the most obvious reason for naming
individuals. Therefore, if during the course of the case, the employing organisation accepts

vicarious liability for any discriminatory actions of the discriminator, the ET may suggest the
claimant withdraws the claim against the individuals. However, as set out below, there are
other powerful reasons why the individuals should remain as respondents. An ET cannot
strike out the case against individual respondents for this reason alone without the
claimant’s consent: this is a judicial decision which should be handled appropriately and
would require grounds.45
•

It usually ensures that the named individuals will give evidence at the hearing, so the
desirability of their attendance must be considered.

•

In sexual harassment cases in particular, it is possible that the employer will require the
individual to obtain separate representation in case there is a conflict of interest. The
claimant may gain useful additional or conflicting information from separated sources. On
the other hand, two separate representatives for the respondents will mean a longer and
more expensive hearing.

•

In harassment cases, it ensures that the individual perpetrator is personally accountable and
unable to hide behind the employer. As stated above, compensation will be awarded equally
against the perpetrator in regard to discriminatory actions by that individual. If there is a
negotiated settlement, part of the settlement sum may be agreed to be paid by the
individual.

•

In sexual harassment claims where the claimant cannot face seeing the harasser in the
room, it is easier to ask the tribunal to exclude the alleged harasser until s/he gives evidence
where s/he is not a named respondent.

•

Where there has been deliberate and malicious discrimination, costs may be awarded
against an individual respondent for unreasonably defending the proceedings.46 This is
valuable because, where, as is common, the employer supports and funds the individual’s
case, it can be implied that s/he has underwritten the individual’s costs,47 including those
ordered against the individual. However, where the individual is not joined as respondent,
unless it can be argued that the principle of vicarious liability extends to vicarious liability
for the conduct of proceedings, the employer could avoid a costs order by claiming that
s/he was entitled to rely on statements from the individual that s/he (the individual) had not
discriminated.

•

If the employing organisation is likely to go into liquidation with no funds for unsecured
creditors, it ensures that the claim can proceed48 and that there is a likelihood of recovering
money, assuming the named individual has any assets. If the employing organisation goes
into liquidation or ceases trading completely unexpectedly and no individual respondent has
been named, the claimant can try to join an individual respondent at a later stage.49

•

Individuals should be named as respondents only if there is a strong case against them, as
the ET may be reluctant to make a specific finding against them without clear evidence.
Caution should be used in naming more than one individual since it is much harder to prove
that a number of individuals have each discriminated against the claimant. There may also
be a risk of costs if naming certain individuals appears frivolous, vexatious or otherwise
unreasonable.

Written reasons for dismissal
21.39

Where the alleged act of discrimination is dismissal, a worker
should usually request written reasons under Employment Rights Act
(ERA) 1996 s92 provided s/he was an employee and had sufficient
service.50 In discrimination cases this may be a particularly
significant piece of evidence. Even if the reply is received within the
14 days, you should always add an ERA 1996 s92 claim to the ET1
since, if the discrimination is proved, there is a possibility that the
claimant will receive an award for untrue reasons.

Case management
Additional information and written answers
21.40

21.41

The considerations and procedure are the same as for unfair
dismissal.51 However, in discrimination cases it is especially
important to secure as much information as possible of the
employer’s defence and this opportunity should not be lost. This is
particularly important now that the statutory questionnaire procedure
has been abolished (see below). For example, where the claimant
was dismissed for fighting at work, s/he could ask: ‘What action was
taken against the other person involved in the fight? In the last three
years have there been other incidents of fighting at work? If so,
when, who was involved, what was their “race’‘ and were they
dismissed; if not, what action was taken against them?’
The employer often asks the claimant to provide very detailed
additional information regarding his/her claim. For comments on
this, see para 21.51.

Disclosure
21.42

21.43

21.44

21.45

Disclosure of documents is a crucial part of the information gathering
process in most discrimination cases.52 The ET will not permit wide,
trawling exercises for helpful evidence. What will be relevant and
useful needs to be thought out (see a sample in appendix A at A13).
If documents are necessary for disposing fairly of a case or for
saving costs, the ET should order their disclosure, even if they are
confidential.53 Where there is a problem about confidentiality, the ET
can look privately at the documents to see if they are necessary and
to decide whether the same information can be obtained in any other
way.
If an ET refuses to order disclosure of something important, you
should write asking that the decision be varied, explaining why the
disclosure is needed and citing any relevant case-law.54 If really
crucial, it may be best to request an oral hearing and to give notice to
the employer of the request. The EAT has said that given the
evidential difficulties in discrimination cases, tribunals should be
generous in orders for disclosure against the employers. Such cases
are not the same as normal litigation, where a party must make out a
credible case before the process of disclosure begins.55 If the ET
continues to refuse disclosure, unless there are powerful grounds for
appeal, it is often best to request the document again during the final
hearing, when it becomes clear whether it is relevant. This is
feasible in discrimination cases because they tend to last several
days.
The ET can order disclosure of relevant statistics provided that
they are relevant to an issue in the case, eg whether the employer,
intentionally or otherwise, operated a discriminatory policy which
manifested itself on other occasions and may have manifested itself
in respect of the present complaint.56
The disclosure process usually refers to documents. However, for
the sake of convenience, the ET can order that the employer supply a
digest of information contained in bulky documents.

21.46

Original documents should always be inspected, as tampering can
happen in discrimination cases, and a request should also be made
that the originals be brought to the hearing. If documents have been
electronically generated, it may be worth asking for them to be sent
by email, as it may be possible to check the date of creation.

Obtaining comparative and statistical information
21.47

21.48

21.49

For nearly forty years, effective use of the statutory questionnaire
procedure under discrimination law offered an important opportunity
to obtain information from the employer. Under this procedure, a
worker was able to ask the employer written questions regarding the
reasons for his/her own treatment and comparative questions
regarding treatment of others with and without the same protected
characteristics. Although employers could not be ordered to answer
the questions, they were expected to do so, and this was underpinned
by EqA 2010 s138(4) which said that an ET could draw an adverse
inference from a failure to answer within eight weeks, or from an
evasive answer.
Unfortunately, the former Conservative and Liberal Democrat
coalition government decided to repeal EqA 2010 s138 and abolish
the statutory questionnaire procedure in respect of all acts of
discrimination on or after 6 April 2014.57 It was replaced by a nonstatutory procedure set out in ACAS guidance, which is not used as
much as it could be. Although the ACAS guidance appears recently
to have disappeared from its website,58 there is no reason why
workers cannot still send a non-statutory questionnaire before or
after they start their discrimination case. The advantage of sending it
before is that the answers may show whether or not it is worth
pursuing a case. This can also be explained to the employer in the
covering letter. Sample questionnaires are set out in appendix A, at
A9–A12. It is much harder to win a discrimination case where no
questionnaire has been submitted.
Although workers cannot ask for the same level of detailed
information as part of the disclosure and information processes, they
should still ask at that point for essential information such as

comparative information of other candidates on a recruitment,
promotion process or redundancy. If the employer objects that certain
information is confidential, it may be possible to agree that names of
other workers be deleted.59 However, sometimes it is not possible to
disguise the identity of other workers, especially where particular
comparators are the subject of enquiry. A particular problem may
arise if the employer objects to providing information regarding
named comparators due to data protection law.60 The prime response
to this is that disclosure is allowed under Data Protection Act (DPA)
2018 Sch 2 para 5 where it is necessary in connection with actual or
prospective legal proceedings or for establishing, exercising or
defending legal rights. Further, though this is superfluous, disclosure
is allowed where the people referred to give explicit consent. An
allegedly worried employer should therefore be invited to seek such
consent. The employer may also dispense with such consent where
reasonable.61

Preliminary hearings – case management
21.50

21.51

ETs usually hold preliminary hearings at an early stage in
discrimination cases for the purpose of making case management
orders (or, in jargon terms, ‘giving directions’).62 The aim is
normally to clarify the ‘issues’, sort out what disclosure, additional
information and written answers should be ordered, decide on
exchange of witness statements, estimate the length of hearing and fix
dates. It helps set the agenda if the request for disclosure and
additional information is sent to the employer in advance of the
preliminary hearing and copied to the ET. Although this rarely
happens, an ET does have power at a preliminary hearing to rule that
certain witnesses cannot be called at the hearing because they are
irrelevant.63
The employment judge will usually start by identifying ‘a list of
issues’. This has two elements. First, identifying every act of
discrimination (and other claim) relied on. It’s very important that
the worker leaves nothing out. Second, breaking down the legal and
sometimes factual issues within each claim. For example, if a claim

21.52

is that the worker’s dismissal was victimisation under EqA 2010
s27, the issues might be: ‘Did the worker complain to HR on 5 May
2021 that she was being excluded from client meetings because she
is Chinese? Was that a protected act? Did the worker make that
allegation in bad faith? Was the worker’s dismissal on 14 July 2021
because she did the protected act?’.64 The list of issues should be
helpful for everyone in preparing to run and defend the case. It will
be a reference point for the tribunal at the final hearing in knowing
what needs to be decided, although ultimately it is what is in the ET1
that counts. If the list of issues contains additional allegations, the
worker will need permission to amend the ET1 to add those. On the
other hand, if anything crucial does not find its way into the list of
issues, it needs to be established whether that is an oversight or it
has actually been dropped. Ideally all this should be sorted out at the
preliminary hearing, but sometimes the position needs to be clarified
later.
At the preliminary hearing, many employers take the opportunity to
seek clarification of the case against them and the adviser should go
prepared for some tricky questions. It is also common for claimants
to be asked to give further written details of exactly what they are
saying. This is fair enough if the ET1 is vague or unstructured, but
where the claim is already clear, employers still tend to request
further detail. The EAT has said there is a difficult balance to be
drawn between requiring particularity on the one hand, and going too
far, so as to render the proceedings technical, legal and pure matters
of form, on the other. ET procedures are designed to give relative
ease of access to unrepresented parties to make their complaints.
When too much is put in writing, ultimately the trial of an action will
dissolve into an examination of a whole series of documents rather
than concentrating on the main issues in the case. Everything should
be made clear by the time of the full hearing by means of an exchange
of witness statements, following full and proper disclosure.65 If taken
by surprise at the preliminary hearing, do not attempt to answer on
the spot. Ask for 14 days to supply voluntary additional information.
This is particularly important if a representative but not the worker

attends the preliminary hearing, as is common. The claimant or
adviser may find that statements or explanations made casually at a
preliminary hearing find their way into the ET’s subsequent order or
account of the hearing and cause problems later, eg by artificially
narrowing the case. Preliminary hearings in discrimination cases
should be prepared for very carefully as they can have a major
impact on shaping the case. The employment judge can exert
considerable pressure to formulate the issues on the spot, and if the
claimant or his/her representative is unprepared or unassertive, the
nature of the case can change.
Mediation
21.53

21.54

In England and Wales, a tribunal may ask the parties at the
preliminary hearing whether they are interested in judicial mediation.
If so, the regional employment judge decides whether to send the
case for mediation, depending on resources and its suitability for
mediation. As a rough guide, cases where the final hearing is likely
to last at least three days and which involve discrimination or where
the claimant is still employed are the most suitable. The regional
employment judge will then hold a telephone preliminary hearing to
see whether both sides are genuinely willing to compromise. If so, a
date for the mediation will be fixed and existing case management
orders will usually be put on hold. The mediation will be carried out
by a trained employment judge and tends to last up to a day. The idea
is to enable the parties to reach a settlement of the case and agree a
way forward if the employee is still employed. The judge’s role is to
remain neutral and avoid giving advice or expressing any opinion on
the merits of the case. His/her function is simply to help the parties
find a resolution. If the mediation is unsuccessful, the tribunal
proceedings will go ahead with a different employment judge and the
contents of the mediation will be kept confidential. The scheme is
similar in Scotland.
As well as judicial mediation, ACAS and private organisations
may offer mediation at any stage before or during the proceedings,
although unlike the tribunal, they may well charge a fee. Whether or

not mediation is a good idea is hard to say. A lot depends on whether
the employer is in good faith, what the claimant wants and whether
s/he can cope with a tribunal hearing. Settlement can be achieved
without a mediation meeting – there is always the normal option of
negotiating via the representatives, usually over the telephone,
through ACAS. The advantage of a meeting is that both parties come
to it with an intention to settle, which makes an agreement more
likely. Also, it gives the claimant the feeling that s/he has brought the
employer to the tribunal forum and has been heard. The disadvantage
is that some employers (or their lawyers) may use the opportunity to
weaken the claimant’s resolve and effectively circumvent the
claimant’s representative. Also, a claimant may give too much away.
Strictly speaking, if the mediation fails, the employer cannot quote
what the claimant said at the mediation to the ET. However, in reality
it will be useful for the employer to hear what the claimant says and
see how s/he reacts under pressure.
Judicial assessment
21.55

21.56

In October 2016, a new ‘judicial assessment’ procedure was
introduced into the tribunals for England and Wales. The procedure,
which is purely voluntary, can take place at the first case
management preliminary hearing after the usual steps have been taken
to define the issues and agree a time-table for case preparation. If a
party is interested in judicial assessment, ideally s/he should notify
the tribunal in advance of the preliminary hearing by ticking the box
on the case management agenda which is usually sent out.
If both parties and the employment judge agree to hold a judicial
assessment, it will take place in the second part of the preliminary
hearing. The idea is that the judge will give a confidential practical
assessment of the strengths, weaknesses and risks of each side’s
arguments. This will be based on the allegations rather than on
evidence, which will not have been heard. It is not supposed to be a
mini-trial and it is not a free advice session. It is just an indication
which may help the parties have a more realistic view of the case
and sums involved, and may therefore encourage settlement. One

21.57

21.58

useful aspect of judicial assessment might be to explain to both sides
the realistic value of the claim if it succeeds.
It is not anticipated that negotiations and settlement will take place
at the judicial assessment. It is not a quick form of judicial
mediation. It may be that the outcome of judicial assessment is that
the parties ask for a day to be fixed for judicial mediation or that they
go away and negotiate directly. The content of the judicial
assessment must be kept confidential. It can be referred to in further
‘without prejudice’ negotiations or at judicial mediation, but not
openly. The employment judge will not be involved in the final
hearing. More detail is set out in Presidential Guidance.66
Judicial assessment does not seem to have been used much in
practice. Clearly there are dangers for a party with a weak case. On
the other hand, it might inject a note of realism where one or other
party is unrealistic, and it may set the ball rolling on negotiations.
Judges are likely to be cautious in what they say, and parties may
need to read between the lines.

Striking out
21.59

An ET at a preliminary hearing may try to discourage or even strike
out some of the claimant’s background evidence on grounds that it is
irrelevant. This would mean that the claimant could not deal with
those matters at the full hearing and would be unable to obtain
related disclosure at the preparatory stages. The EAT has said that an
ET should be careful not to overstep the line between legitimate case
management and oversimplifying the case by striking out proper
claims to save time.67 Although it may be desirable that cases should
be kept within proper bounds, the claimant must not be prevented
from putting his/her full case. An ET certainly should not refuse to
allow in relevant evidence of past acts of discrimination simply to
save time.68 On the other hand, evidence can be excluded if it is not
relevant or if its relevance is only marginal, eg evidence of a historic
discriminatory culture in the organisation involving entirely different
people to those involved in the current claim.69 The EAT has said it
is not generally a good idea for background evidence to be struck out

21.60

at a preliminary stage since the tribunal at the full hearing is usually
the best placed to decide whether evidence is relevant, and it can
manage the hearing as it goes along; however, there will be cases
where there are real advantages in ruling out irrelevant evidence at
an early stage, eg where it will otherwise substantially lengthen the
hearing or incur substantial costs for the other party.70
If the ET wishes to strike out some of the claims (as opposed to
supporting evidence), it must follow the correct procedure.71 An ET
has power to strike out or amend all or part of a claim on grounds
that it is scandalous, vexatious or has no reasonable prospect of
success.72 The claimant must have been given a reasonable chance to
argue against the striking out.73 Where a discrimination case looks
extremely weak on the ET1, an ET may be tempted to strike out the
whole claim, but this should not occur except in the most obvious
case. Discrimination cases are generally fact-sensitive and their
proper determination is vital in a pluralistic society.74 For general
principles on striking out, see paras 20.111 and 20.165 onwards.

Privacy and restrictions on disclosure
21.61

21.62

ET hearings are open to the public and reporters are in regular
attendance in some tribunals, often arranging for photographers to
ambush unwitting claimants as they leave the building. Judgments
generally go onto a public register,75 although not those which simply
confirm a case has been withdrawn (often as a result of a settlement).
ETs have a general power under rule 50 to make suitable orders to
protect privacy so far as they consider necessary in the interests of
justice or to protect anyone’s rights under the European Convention
on Human Rights (ECHR or ‘the Convention’).76 This raises difficult
issues about the balance between ECHR Article 8 (the right to
private life), Article 10 (the right to freedom of expression) and
Article 6 (entitlement to a fair and public hearing) of the
Convention.77 In theory, an order can be applied for and made in any
kind of case, eg where very personal issues are involved such as a
claimant undergoing gender reassignment or with certain kinds of
disability, or where exceptionally serious allegations of misconduct

21.63

21.64

21.65

have been made.78 However, the vast majority of cases where the
issue arises involve sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct.
Tribunals have a great deal of flexibility in the type of order which
they can make. For example, they can order that all or part of the
hearing be conducted in private or that the identities of parties,
witnesses or other individuals are kept anonymous during the hearing
and/or in written records including documents, listing notices and the
public register. This can apply for a limited period of time or
permanently. However, a tribunal has no power to keep a judgment
off the public register (except in national security cases).79 A
tribunal can also make a restricted reporting order (RRO)80 where
the case involves allegations of ‘sexual misconduct’ (eg a sexual
harassment case). This specifies that certain parties must not be
publicly identified and can cover the person making the allegation or
anyone affected by it. An RRO remains in force (unless revoked
earlier) only until the final decision is promulgated. It can also be
made permanent where necessary to protect Convention rights.81 The
significance of an RRO as opposed to any other kind of rule 50 order
is that it is a criminal offence to publish information in breach of it.82
The tribunal can make a rule 50 order at any stage, either on its
own initiative, or on an application by a party or someone else. A
party can make a written application or raise it at any preliminary
hearing or at the full merits hearing. Any party or other person
(including the press) with a legitimate interest who has not had a
reasonable opportunity to make representations before an order is
made can apply for the order to be revoked.
Tribunals do not automatically issue rule 50 orders just because
one party asks or even if both sides consent. Case-law in recent
years, often in non-employment cases, has placed a very strong
emphasis on the importance of ‘open justice’. It is a general
principle of UK constitutional law that justice is administered in
public. The starting point is therefore that the principle of open
justice is of paramount importance and departing from that can only
be justified when it is strictly necessary to secure the proper
administration of justice.83 This might occur if fear of publicity

21.66

21.67

would genuinely deter a worker from bringing a claim. In relation to
discrimination claims, the EU directives require member states to
provide an effective remedy and make judicial processes ‘available’
to those claiming discrimination covered by the directives.84 Having
said that, it is important to note that the wording of rule 50 does
allow privacy orders to be made in wider circumstances, ie where
necessary to protect someone’s Convention rights, eg an individual’s
honour and reputation.85 Note also that under the Sexual Offences
(Amendment) Act 1992, there must be no publication of any
information likely to lead the public to identify a person who is
alleged to have been a victim of a sexual offence.86 There might also
be circumstances where it is important to protect vulnerable third
parties.87
Ironically, although the reporting restrictions were originally
brought in with a view to protecting complainants of sexual
harassment,88 it is very often the alleged perpetrators in such cases
who try to obtain an order against the claimant’s will. Some
claimants have experienced heavy-handed attempts from their
employers to silence them from the moment they raised the
allegations, as well as intimidation from the harasser not to speak
out. By the time they reach an ET, they wish the matter to be out in
the open. It is now unlikely that the employer’s fear of reputational
damage will be enough on its own to prevent an open hearing,
although it may be a factor. After all, the situation is no different from
that in any other civil or criminal court. If the allegations are false,
then the alleged perpetrator will be vindicated through the judicial
process.89 Even with serious unsubstantiated allegations, the public
can be trusted to distinguish between an allegation and a finding of
guilt.90 A request for an order that those less directly involved are
anonymised is even less likely to succeed, eg managers conducting
an investigation, or the employing organisation itself.91 Any order
which is made should also not be too wide-ranging in terms of which
incidents are covered.92
When reading the older case-law, bear in mind that ETs’ power
was more specific prior to 2013. Under the 2004 ET rules, there

were two kinds of order: 1) an RRO (see above) in a case involving
sexual misconduct or where there was evidence of a personal nature
relating to disability, and 2) in cases involving a sexual offence,
there would be a permanent deletion from the Register and other
tribunal documents of the identity of those affected by or making the
allegations.93

Preparation for the hearing
Witness statements
Well-written witness statements can be very effective in helping to
win discrimination cases. As opening speeches are rare, the
claimant’s witness statement will be particularly important in
creating a strong first impression and providing an overall picture of
what the case is about. The basic procedure and considerations are
set out at paras 20.186–20.196. The following additional tips are
useful in writing statements in discrimination cases:

21.68

•

If the claimant is likely to be the first witness, explain important background at the start of
the statement, eg how the workplace is structured, the hierarchy, and the claimant’s job.

•

The claimant’s evidence should be set out clearly, and usually in chronological order, though
sometimes it is clearer to group ‘themes’, eg keeping a history of failed promotion attempts
separate from the chronology of a dismissal for alleged misconduct.

•

If possible without destroying the sense and logical order, indicate some of the
discriminatory elements early in the statement. For example, in a race discrimination case,
draw attention to a white dominant work hierarchy or to any racist remarks early on.

•

Draw attention to legally relevant facts. For example, in a case of direct race
discrimination, always point out where the employer’s behaviour is different from the
norm.94 In direct discrimination cases, different treatment is more relevant than unfair
treatment.

•

In a disability discrimination case, a claimant may face difficult questioning related to the
definition of ‘disability’. The claimant may not answer properly under the stress of a
hearing. It is also well-known that some people play down the effect of their disability. A
well-written witness statement addressing each aspect of the definition, having discussed
the matter carefully with the claimant when s/he is not under the pressure of crossexamination in a public forum, may be crucial.

•

Include facts relevant to proving the claimant’s injury to feelings and, if applicable, health.95
If the employer has particularly upset the claimant by aggressive behaviour, highlight this,
as it will be relevant to aggravated damages.

•

The witness statement will be probably read in private by the tribunal panel at the start of
the hearing, and it is unlikely that the claimant will be asked to read it again out loud. It is
important that it is clear; easy to understand, absorb and remember; and that it does not
bury the best points in a mass of unnecessary detail. The length of the statement will
depend on the size of the case, but as an extremely rough rule of thumb, the claimant’s
witness statement in, say, a five-day discrimination case should not be longer than 6,000–
9,000 words.

•

Ensure that the claimant understands and agrees with the content of his/her statement. Try
to use his/her normal way of speaking and avoid jargon. If the claimant’s English is very
limited, the most practical step is probably to write the statement in English with the
assistance of an interpreter. Then ask the interpreter to read it back in the claimant’s first
language, checking carefully that the content is understood and agreed. Then as a final
paragraph, the statement should say that the claimant has had this statement translated
back to him/her and that it is accurate. The statement should then be signed by the claimant
and also the interpreter.

Preparing the claimant
21.69

It should be clearly explained to the claimant what has to be proved
and that the issue is discrimination, not fairness. In particular, it
should be stressed that it is necessary to prove that the reason for
what happened was the claimant’s race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age or related to disability. Advise the claimant to keep
to the relevant incidents, not to quote weak examples or accuse
irrelevant people of racism or sexism. Certain cross-examination
techniques are very common and the claimant should be warned. In
particular, s/he is likely to be asked in respect of all key persons for
the employer whether they are (for example) racist or have
discriminated. Explain the legal significance of saying that someone
may have discriminated and that it is not the same as saying that
someone is prejudiced. If the legal issues are not explained, the
claimant may find that as a result of being pinned down at the outset,
s/he unwittingly makes concessions or gives evidence which

21.70

(wrongly) appears to contradict how the case has been set out. On
the other hand, be careful not to confuse the claimant.
Most discrimination hearings are traumatic experiences, whatever
the results, so the claimant should bring along a friend or relative,
especially where s/he may otherwise be the only woman or black
person in the room. Sexual harassment cases will be particularly
unpleasant, and the claimant should be warned about possible lines
of cross-examination.

Accessibility of tribunals and legal advice
Vulnerable witnesses
21.71

21.72

The Presidential Guidance on vulnerable parties and witnesses in
employment tribunal proceedings96 says that where relevant, parties
and the tribunal should consider whether a party’s participation in
proceedings generally is likely to be diminished because of
vulnerability and if so, whether to make appropriate orders to
facilitate participation. In particular, this includes a party or
witness’s mental or physical disability or health condition; domestic
circumstances; social and cultural background; age, maturity and
understanding; ethnic origin or religious belief (if relevant); and the
impact of any actual or potential intimidation. The Guidance
encourages active case management and gives examples of measures
which might be taken.
In addition, the Judicial College’s Equal Treatment Bench Book97
is an excellent resource to help both practitioners and judges think
about the impact of tribunal proceedings on vulnerable witnesses,
and to consider what adjustments might be needed. The suggestions
in the Equal Treatment Bench Book are not compulsory. The Bench
Book only provides good practice guidance for judges. Judges still
need to decide what adjustments are appropriate in any case, bearing
in mind the evidence as to the individual’s needs and the impact on
the other side. However, case-law in recent years has endorsed
looking at the guidance in the Equal Treatment Bench Book.
Disabled workers

21.73

21.75

21.76

It is generally accepted that ETs, as an organ of the state, should
make necessary reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled
workers have a fair hearing. There is some uncertainty regarding the
source of this obligation and whether it derives from the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as
incorporated into UK law by the Equal Treatment Directive, or from
common law principles of fairness. There is also the right to a fair
hearing under ECHR Article 6, together with Article 14 (nondiscrimination). Strictly-speaking, the duty probably does not arise
as a service provider under EqA 2010 Part 3 because of the
exemptions in the statute. In any event, the legal route does not
appear to matter because of the consensus that the obligation exists.98
The issue is simply how far a tribunal should go in making
adjustments. The rights of the other party to the case cannot be
completely ignored, but the principle of enabling full access to the
tribunal system for everyone is very important indeed.
The Equal Treatment Bench Book (see above) has separate
chapters on physical and mental disability and particularly helpful is
the ‘Disability: glossary of impairments’. It is also worth reading
chapter 2 (Children, young people and vulnerable adults). This
focuses on the criminal justice system of ground rules hearings,
special measures and intermediaries, but can provide further ideas
for adjustments. Most interesting is the case-law which has
developed regarding possible adjustments to cross-examination
where witnesses are very vulnerable.99
Although, as already stated, the suggestions in the Bench Book are
only good practice guidance, the EAT in Rackham v NHS
Professionals Ltd100 and the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in
Galo v Bombardier Aerospace UK, have encouraged tribunals to
consider its advice in respect of disabled claimants.101 Many of the
recommendations in the Equal Treatment Bench Book would also be
relevant to arrangements made by advice agencies, solicitors and
barristers when providing advice to disabled clients.
The Equal Treatment Bench Book recognises that the practical and
procedural requirements of the tribunal process are likely to present

additional barriers for disabled people, eg physical barriers to
access, not just for wheelchair users (eg accessible waiting and
hearing rooms, parking facilities, toilets); communication with ET
staff and written information in inaccessible formats; difficulties
sitting still for long periods of time or without breaks; and for users
with learning difficulties or mental health issues, possible difficulty
understanding the process or progress of their case and generally
additional stress. The EAT in Rackham stressed that it is important
for tribunals to remember that every individual is different.
Adjustments need to be tailored to the needs of the individual and not
according to some general idea about what people with a particular
disability might need. Considerable value should be placed on the
integrity and autonomy of the individual, and they should be listened
to. It is not for other people and courts to say what adjustments
would be suitable.
Possible adjustments in the hearing, depending on what is needed,
might for example be:

21.77

21.78

•

more breaks, later start times or shorter days;

•

slowing down the pace of cross-examination;

•

changing the usual order of witnesses;

•

arranging for electronic bundles so that they can be enlarged;

•

rearranging where everyone sits in the room;

•

checking that the room has appropriate light, temperature and noise levels;

•

providing a private waiting room for the individual (if available).

Rackham v NHS Professionals Ltd illustrates adjustments which
were made for a claimant with Asperger’s Syndrome.102
Although a tribunal has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that
there is a fair hearing, where a disabled claimant is legally
represented, a tribunal is usually entitled to leave it to the
professional representatives to take the lead in suggesting what
adjustments may be needed and getting any necessary medical
advice.103 There is a box on the standard claim form inviting the
claimant to state any assistance s/he requires if s/he has a disability.
Be specific about what is needed and do not assume that the ET will

know or ask the right questions. Even then, do not just rely on the
tribunal noticing what is written on the form. Raise the matter with
the tribunal at an early stage. Advisers should inform the ET well
ahead of the hearing about any special requirements which an
individual may have. With a party or witness who is deaf, for
example, the adviser should discuss the layout and lighting of the ET
room, the type of assistance needed for the person’s usual mode of
communication, and if an interpreter is required, their necessary
qualifications. It is worth letting the employer’s representative know
in advance too. A good time to discuss arrangements would be at any
preliminary hearing to discuss case management. Alternatively, the
EAT in Rackham suggested a dedicated ‘ground rules hearing’ might
be useful where suitable adjustments can be worked out.104 Although
the adjustments which are identified at this early stage should not be
set in stone, they can act as a useful baseline. These steps should be
taken quickly.
Religious dress
21.79

In general, religious dress should be permitted in the tribunal,
although there may be objections if a Muslim woman wishes to wear
the veil while giving evidence. The matter should be handled with
sensitivity, and careful thought should be given as to whether the veil
presents a true (rather than imagined) difficulty. In an ET, factfindings are usually based on factors other than facial expression, eg
documents, corroborating witnesses and the content of what a
witness says. Identity can be established in private outside the court
room, eg by a female clerk comparing the witness’s face with a
passport photograph. It is important to check the latest guidance
provided by the Judicial College for judges in courts and tribunals in
its Equal Treatment Bench Book.105

Interpreters, medical and witness expenses
21.80

Interpreters may be needed for witnesses who do not speak English
as a first language as well as for deaf or blind workers. Parties are
not generally permitted to bring their own interpreters, but the

21.81

tribunal will provide an interpreter free of charge if requested. A
witness may be able to read English well or speak it reasonably
well, but the question is whether s/he can give the best account of
his/her evidence without an interpreter.106 It is important to give the
tribunal as much advance notice as possible, especially if a signlanguage interpreter is required. In Wales, there is a right to speak
Welsh, and the Welsh Language Unit will provide an interpreter if a
Welsh-speaking tribunal cannot be arranged.107
Witness expenses are no longer paid by the tribunal. For the ET’s
power to order one or other party to pay a witness’s costs of
attending, see paras 20.265–20.267. The tribunal may still pay
reasonable charges for the attendance of medical professionals or the
production of medical reports where that is essential to the case and
if ordered by the ET in advance. It is very important to check this
will happen before incurring any expense. Also ask to see any
indicative pay rates applied by the tribunal for medical evidence.

Remedy
21.82

Most tribunals these days will expect to deal with both liability and
remedy within the period listed for the hearing. This means being
fully prepared to deal with compensation and other aspects of
remedy if the claimant wins. It is surprisingly common for this aspect
of preparation to be less thorough than the rest. The claimant needs to
be in a position to prove his/her net and gross weekly pay. In a
dismissal case, s/he needs to have details and documentary evidence
of the efforts s/he has made to find a new job, and these documents
must have been disclosed to the employer and copied for the
tribunal. The claimant needs some kind of medical evidence to
support his/her claim for injury to feelings and if s/he is claiming
personal injury, s/he will probably need a consultant’s report. The
claimant should also give some advanced thought to what
recommendations s/he would like the tribunal to make. If the
claimant has suffered severe injury to feelings or personal injury, it
may be better to ask the tribunal to confine the first hearing to
liability (win or lose) and fix a separate remedy hearing if necessary.

This is because a consultant’s report will probably be needed, and
the claimant will not wish to incur the costs until s/he knows whether
s/he has won and on what basis. Separate hearings for liability and
for remedy are more common in England and Wales than in Scotland.

The hearing
Start of hearing: preliminary issues
21.83

Sometimes the ET will decide certain issues relating to procedure or
jurisdiction immediately before starting the full hearing. It is
advisable to warn the employer’s representative in advance if the
claimant plans to ask the tribunal to make an order for a contentious
document, so the employer does not argue that s/he has been caught
by surprise. If there are time limit issues, it may be possible to
decide these at the outset, but it is more likely that they can only be
considered by the tribunal along with its decision on merits after all
the evidence has been heard. Where there is a time limit problem,
this will usually be picked up by the employer or the tribunal at the
outset of the case, if not earlier, and it will be added to the issues to
be decided when the tribunal goes over these with the parties.
Surprisingly often, the claimant then forgets to say anything more
about it. Remember that the claimant must give evidence about why
the claim was late, and the claimant’s representative should address
in his/her closing comments whether there is continuing
discrimination and/or whether the tribunal should exercise its just
and equitable discretion.

Opening
21.84

As the burden of proof is on the claimant in a discrimination case,
usually the claimant and then his/her witnesses go first. In the past,
the party who started gave an opening speech, but this no longer
happens except in exceptional circumstances. Some legal
representatives offer the tribunal a written opening statement, but this
is unnecessary. Where a discrimination claim is combined with one
of unfair dismissal, it is unclear who should start, and the ET has the

right to govern its own procedure. In order to plan ahead, it is helpful
to agree with the employer’s representative in advance who should
go first. Where everything depends on the employer’s explanation for
what s/he has done, it may be most sensible if s/he goes first. On the
other hand, this may set an agenda which distracts from a sequence of
events pointing to discrimination. It may also mean that the
employer’s witnesses escape grilling on crucial points because these
have not yet been highlighted by the claimant’s oral evidence.

Strategy
Although the issues will probably have been clarified at a
preliminary hearing (see above), ETs often ask workers’
representatives to answer the following sort of question put at the
start of the hearing:

21.85

•

Is it alleged that the worker was discriminated against because s/he is of African national
origin or because s/he is black?

•

Precisely who are you alleging discriminated against the claimant? In promotion cases,
which members of the selection panel are you alleging discriminated?

21.86

If necessary, the issues should be kept open by putting matters in the
alternative. Some ETs recognise that in a promotion case, for
example, the claimant cannot know how a decision was made, who
influenced whom, who may have been prejudiced, who may have
unconsciously discriminated, etc and permit the claimant simply to
say it was some or all of the panel. If an ET insists on the claimant
saying which of a selection panel discriminated, unless one panel
member clearly had a decisive influence, it may be best to name all
panel members, reserving the right to drop the allegations against
some. The claimant’s representative may also wish to register a
formal protest against being forced to take a position, to safeguard
the possibility of a later appeal.
As a general rule, it is best to run cases in a low-key way. Fierce
cross-examination and use of emotive words such as ‘racist’ or
‘liar’ will usually alienate the ET. In any opening discussion, the
ET’s expectations should not be needlessly raised. It may be planned

21.87

21.88

21.89

to reveal overt prejudice, but legally this need not be shown, so do
not promise more than may be possible to deliver. On the evidence,
the ET may find it easier to accept that senior managers have acted
with benevolent motives or through a desire to have someone who
‘fits in’ rather than through racial or sexual hostility.
In most cases, it is not certain whether the act of direct
discrimination was conscious or unconscious, intended or not. The
ET should not be relied on to understand what unconscious
discrimination is or that it can happen. An ET may still look for
indications of deliberate discrimination (whether the motives were
good or bad) and focus on the honesty and sincerity of the
employer’s witnesses. This issue must be taken on explicitly. It
should be explained that an employer may not be aware that s/he has
discriminated and that the proper approach for the ET to take in
determining direct discrimination or victimisation cases, ie whether
inferences can be drawn from the primary facts, does not require it to
make a finding as to whether the unlawful discrimination was
conscious or not.108
The main opportunity to make comments will be in the closing
speech, although this may be too late if the ET has listened to the
evidence with the wrong perspective. Sometimes an ET can be
reminded indirectly of the correct approach by the way the
employer’s witnesses are cross-examined, eg a witness can be asked
(if relevant) whether s/he accepts discrimination can sometimes be
unconscious.
On the whole, the fewer people that have to be proved
discriminatory or prejudiced, the easier it is to convince an ET,
except where the main point is that a whole workplace was hostile
towards workers of a particular race or sex. Unless there is
extremely strong evidence, probably in the form of a direct witness,
any suggestion of a conspiracy or policy in the employing
organisation to discriminate should be avoided. As a final note of
caution, in running the case, be careful not to lose sight of the main
issues in a mass of detail.

Dismissals
21.90

21.91

Where an unfair dismissal claim is also before the ET, it usually
entails quite different considerations. The issues should be kept
separate in any opening comments and in the closing speech.
Where the worker does not have sufficient service to qualify for
claiming unfair dismissal, employers may argue that the
discrimination claim is an attempt to circumvent the qualifying
period under the ERA 1996. Great care must be taken when running
such a case not to deal with issues which relate solely to fairness.109
Constantly draw attention to differences from the norm. Even so, in
some circumstances it may be appropriate to argue that an
employer’s failure to explain his/her reasons for failing to follow
disciplinary procedures, inadequate grounds for dismissal, failure to
consult, etc are also matters from which an inference of less
favourable treatment may be drawn.

No case to answer
21.92

21.93

It rarely happens, but it is possible that at the end of the evidence of
the claimant and his/her witnesses, the employer may ask the ET to
reject the case at that stage on the basis that the claimant has not
proved enough facts to shift the burden of proof and receive an
explanation from the employer.110 The ET should be reminded of the
decision in Laher v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC,111 that only in
the most exceptional cases should the employer not be called to give
an explanation. If the ET dismisses the case at that stage, there is a
likely basis for appeal.112
Some ETs deal with the matter instead by warning the claimant
about the costs of proceeding further. Regardless of whether the ET
actually gives a costs warning, claimants’ representatives should be
aware of the danger of an ultimate award of costs if the ET seems
sympathetic to the suggestion that there is no case to answer.

Costs

Costs can be awarded regardless of whether there was a previous
costs warning and deposit. Costs are awarded on the same basis as
in unfair dismissal cases,113 although they seem to be awarded more
readily against unsuccessful claimants in discrimination cases.
Because of the greater length of the latter, costs tend to be larger.
There is little that can be done about this except to keep the issues
within reasonable bounds and to be aware that if a case is clearly
going badly, points should not be laboured. If a costs award has to be
argued, point out the matters which called for an explanation from the
employer and could only be obtained in the forum of an ET hearing.
If the employer failed to answer questions contained in a letter
before the case was started, point out that this could have provided
an early explanation to the claimant. As a matter of public policy,
discrimination cases should be heard.114

21.94

Appeals
For more detail on the procedure and time limits for appeals to the
EAT and ET reconsiderations, see para 20.243 onwards. As with
unfair dismissal cases, an appeal to the EAT must usually be lodged
within 42 days from the date the written judgment was sent out, or in
some circumstances, within 42 days of when the written reasons
were sent out. A reconsideration must be requested of the ET within
14 days of the judgment being sent out or, if written reasons were
sent out later, then within 14 days of that.
An appeal can only be lodged if the judgment was wrong in law or
perverse on the facts. It is hard to challenge discrimination decisions
for perversity, but they can sometimes be appealed for taking the
wrong approach. For example:

21.95

21.96

•

The ET must give adequate and intelligible reasons for its decision so that each party
knows why s/he has won or lost.115

•

The ET must make findings of the primary facts and follow them through to a reasoned
conclusion. It is not enough simply to set out the relevant evidential issues without deciding
what happened, though there need not be a fact finding on every minor issue.116

•

The ET should not give credence to a witness purely because s/he appears to be honest or
truthful, without considering the whole of the evidence in the case. A witness may be
credible and honest but mistaken. ETs must recognise that witnesses can unconsciously
discriminate.117

•

The ET must not evaluate a series of allegedly discriminatory incidents in isolation and
consider whether each on its own is proved to be discrimination. The ET must also
consider any ‘eloquence that the cumulative effect of the primary facts might have’.118

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures
sets out basic principles of fair practice and natural justice
which should form part of the procedures. It is not against the
law in itself to fail to follow the Code, but an employment
tribunal (ET) must take account of the Code in deciding any
unfair dismissal case.
A tribunal may adjust compensation by up to 25 per cent if one
party unreasonably fails to follow the ACAS Code. This applies
where employees bring specified cases including unfair
dismissal and discrimination.
It is also important to be familiar with the worker’s own
disciplinary and grievance procedure.
An ET case can be brought for unfair dismissal, but not for
‘unfair warnings’. Unfair warnings which do not lead to actual
or constructive dismissal cannot usually be legally challenged
unless they are discriminatory or an unlawful detriment on
certain specified grounds.
Except for gross misconduct, there should not normally be
dismissal for a first offence.
Even on allegations of gross misconduct, fair investigative and
disciplinary procedures should be followed.
Workers have a legal right to be accompanied to disciplinary
and grievance hearings.
Discrimination maybe relevant to disciplinary action or the
subject of grievances.
Be very careful not to miss legal time limits while taking out
grievances or appeals.
This chapter should be read in conjunction with the chapters on
unfair dismissal (chapter 20) and discrimination (chapter 21)
as appropriate.

Disciplinary action including dismissal
Introduction
22.1

22.2

Basic principles of good practice in conducting disciplinary action
are set out in the Advisory, Counciliation and Arbitration Service
(ACAS) Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance
Procedures. When deciding unfair dismissal cases, the employment
tribunal (ET) must take account of any failure by an employer to
follow the Code. As well as being relevant to whether a dismissal
was unfair, the Code can also affect compensation. In specified
cases, including unfair dismissal and discriminatory disciplinary
action or dismissal, a successful claimant’s compensation may be
reduced or increased by up to 25 per cent if s/he or the employer
respectively unreasonably failed to follow the Code. More detail of
the Code is set out below.
There may be additional good practice steps set out in the
employee’s own disciplinary procedure. Where the employee has
been or is likely to be dismissed, this chapter should be read in
conjunction with the chapters on unfair dismissal. Where
discrimination is involved, the discrimination chapters should be
read. If disciplinary warnings are unfair, but not discriminatory or
unlawful on any other ground (eg detriment for taking up rights under
the Working Time Regulations (WTR) 1998) there is generally little
an employee can do except register his/her disagreement in writing
or in an appeal, so that this is at least noted on the file if matters get
worse in the future and s/he is ultimately dismissed. In extreme cases
s/he can resign and claim constructive dismissal, but this is not
usually advised.

The ACAS Code
22.3

The ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance
Procedures sets out good practice guidelines for the handling of
disciplinary and grievance issues in employment. The latest version

of the Code (COP 1, 11 March 2015) can be downloaded from the
ACAS website.1 Although it is not against the law in itself for
employers to fail to follow the Code, ETs must take this into account
when deciding unfair dismissal cases.2 The Code states explicitly
that it does not apply to redundancy dismissals or to non-renewal of
fixed-term contracts.
The Code has always been important for unfair dismissal cases,
but it gained new significance in April 2009, when it became linked
to the level of compensation. This is because an ET may increase or
reduce an employee’s compensation by up to 25 per cent in any
successful case for unfair dismissal, discrimination or other
specified claims, because of the employer’s or employee’s
unreasonable failure to follow the Code where it applies.3
There have been few appeal cases setting guidelines regarding the
degree of percentage uplift for failure to follow the Code. The
legislation simply says the tribunal ‘may, if it considers it just and
equitable in all the circumstances to do so, increase any award it
makes by no more than 25 per cent’. One factor likely to affect the
size of the uplift is the degree to which the employer was at fault for
not knowing about the Code. Another factor might be the
consequence of the failure to follow the Code, so that a failure which
did not make much difference to the claimant’s substantive rights
might lead to a lower uplift than a substantial breach, eg failing to
give the claimant sufficient information to argue against why s/he
should be dismissed. Where the underlying award is large, it means
that the percentage uplift will amount to a lot of money. A tribunal
must take this into account when deciding how much it is just and
equitable to award.4
Examples of recommendations in the Code are:

22.4

22.5

22.6
•

employees and, where appropriate, their representatives, should be involved in the
development of rules and procedures;

•

employers (and employees) should act consistently;

•

it is important to carry out investigations of potential disciplinary matters without
unreasonable delay;

•

where practicable, different people should carry out the investigation and disciplinary
hearing;

•

if there is to be a disciplinary hearing, an employee should be given sufficient information
about the alleged misconduct or poor performance to prepare to answer the case;

•

the notification of the disciplinary should advise the employee of his/her right to be
accompanied. The companion may be a work colleague or a trade union representative;

•

employees should be given the right to appeal against any formal decision made.

Not all failures to follow the Code may be considered relevant in
any particular case. The actual wording of the legislation says
compensation may be adjusted where:

22.7

•

‘the claim to which the proceedings relate concerns a matter to which a relevant Code
applies’; and

•

the employer or employee has unreasonably failed to comply with the Code ‘in relation to
that matter’.5

22.8

So how direct does the connection need to be between the content of
the Code and the claim? Clearly a concrete matter such as refusal of
the right to appeal could lead to extra compensation if an unfair
dismissal claim succeeded for that reason. However, what if the
breach of the Code was the failure to involve employees or their
representatives in the development of the disciplinary rules?
Another uncertainty is the type of case to which the Code applies.
Its content most obviously refers to disciplinary action related to
misconduct or incapability. On the other hand, it only explicitly
excludes dismissals for redundancy or non-renewal of fixed-term
contracts. What about dismissals for other reasons? The Employment
Appeal Tribunal (EAT) has said that the Code applies to all cases
where an employee’s alleged actions or omissions involve culpable
conduct or performance that requires correction or punishment.6 This
means the Code can apply to a dismissal which is ultimately for
‘some other substantial reason’ such as personality clash or poor
work relations, but which one would usually expect to be handled
through the disciplinary procedure.7 On the other hand, it suggests the
Code does not apply to dismissals for ‘some other substantial
reason’ (SOSR) not involving culpable behaviour, eg dismissals in

22.9

22.10

order to change terms and conditions. The Code does not apply to an
ill-health dismissal, unless there are conduct issues such as a
question mark over whether the ill-health is genuine or a failure to
follow the employer’s ill-health procedures.8 The Code is unlikely to
apply to a dismissal for whistleblowing, because a protected
disclosure cannot be a legitimate ground for disciplinary action.
However, the disclosure may amount to a grievance as defined by the
Code, in which case the Code’s requirements regarding grievances
would apply.9
The Code refers to the treatment of ‘employees’, although ACAS
says in the introduction that it is good practice to allow all workers
(and not just employees) access to disciplinary and grievance
procedures. However, the power to adjust compensation for failure
to follow the Code only applies where it is an employee who has
brought the case.10
Unlike the 2004 version which it replaced, the current ACAS
Code is extremely short – under ten pages. By reducing its guidance
to obvious and basic steps, it has lost much of its value in setting
standards. Most of the more subtle guidance has been removed to a
70-page guide: Discipline and grievances at work: the ACAS
Guide.11 The guide sets out extracts from the Code and expands it
with more advice. Tribunals do not need to pay any attention to the
guide, and it is difficult to predict whether it will have any influence
in cases. Nevertheless, ACAS does have recognised status in the
field of industrial relations, and the guide expands on what is usually
regarded as good practice. It may be useful to quote sections from the
guide, for example, during disciplinary hearings.

The employer’s disciplinary rules
22.11

Employers should have their own written disciplinary procedure,
which will normally cover the disciplinary rules, and standards of
expected conduct, as well as the procedures to be followed when
disciplining a worker. The rules usually set out unacceptable
behaviour in a number of areas, although obviously not every
scenario can be covered. The written rule effectively serves as

advance warning to the employee. Employers sometimes have rules
that employees will be automatically dismissed for certain offences,
eg fighting at work, regardless of the circumstances. Nevertheless, in
an unfair dismissal case, the ET will still expect the employer to
have considered the individual circumstances including: whether the
employee was aware of the rule and its seriousness; the employee’s
general work and disciplinary record; the reason the employee broke
the rule on this occasion; and any mitigating factors.
The disciplinary rules normally list examples of behaviour which
is considered to be gross misconduct (see paras 22.17–22.18).

22.12

The disciplinary process: procedural steps
Employers should follow their own procedure when disciplining the
employee, provided it complies with the general standards of
fairness set by the ACAS Code. The following stages are generally
regarded as good practice:

22.13

•

The ACAS Code says it is important to carry out necessary investigations of potential
disciplinary matters without unreasonable delay, so as to establish the facts.12 An employee
may be asked about an event so long after it occurred that s/he cannot give a proper
explanation. This can make a dismissal unfair. The investigation stage may involve holding
a preliminary meeting with the employee or may simply entail gathering evidence. The
Code advises that where practical, different people should carry out the investigation and
the disciplinary hearing in misconduct cases. An investigating or disciplinary officer is
entitled to ask for human resources (HR) advice, but HR must not go beyond advice on
law, procedure and process. HR should not step into areas of culpability or appropriate
sanction, except for advising on consistency.13

•

Minor cases of misconduct and most cases of poor performance should be dealt with
through informal advice and counselling. The manager’s objective should be to encourage
and help the employee to improve. It is important that the employee understands what the
problem is, what needs to be done to improve and over what period, and how his/her
performance will be reviewed.

•

Where formal disciplinary action is likely, the formal procedure should be followed. There
should be a disciplinary hearing at which the employee is given the opportunity to answer
the allegations and state his/her case. The ACAS Code says the employee must be

informed in writing of the disciplinary hearing and told of his/her right to be accompanied.
The notification should give sufficient information regarding the alleged misconduct or poor
performance and its possible consequences, to enable the employee to prepare for the
hearing. ACAS says it would normally be appropriate to provide copies of any written
evidence including any witness statements with the notification.
•

The ACAS Code says the disciplinary hearing should be held without unreasonable delay
while allowing the employee reasonable time to prepare his/her case. At the hearing, the
employer should explain the complaint and go through the evidence against the employee.
The employee should be given a reasonable opportunity to answer questions and present
his/her case.

•

If disciplinary action is taken, the employee should be given an explanation why and
informed of his/her right of appeal. The ACAS Code says that appeals should be heard
without unreasonable delay and, where possible, dealt with by a manager who has not
previously been involved in the case.

•

Where serious misconduct is alleged, it may be fair to suspend the employee during the
investigatory or disciplinary process, although this should be for as short a time as possible
and kept under review. Unless the contract says otherwise, suspension should be on full
pay. Although employers like to say suspension is a ‘neutral’ act, it is not. It may not
indicate the employer has reached any adverse conclusion, but it can still have damaging
effects. An employer should not suspend an employee without reasonable and proper
cause to do so.14

•

Overall, the process should be handled without undue delay and confidentiality should be
maintained. The employee should be given records of the hearings.

Forms of disciplinary action
It is long-established good practice that no employee is dismissed
for a first offence unless it amounts to gross misconduct. Therefore
the employee should normally have received some warnings before
dismissal. It is often thought that the law requires precisely one oral
and two written warnings before an employee can be fairly
dismissed. This is a myth. If the employee’s offence is sufficiently
serious, the employer can skip the earlier warnings. However, the
usual stages followed would be:

22.14

•

Informal action. This is suitable for cases of minor misconduct or unsatisfactory
performance. A quiet word should be enough to deal with the problem. It may be

particularly helpful in small employers where problems can be dealt with quickly and
confidentially.
•

First formal action. The employer can start at this stage for more serious difficulties and it
will usually take the form of a first written warning. ACAS says the warning should set out
the details of the complaint, the required improvement with timescale, and the right of
appeal. The warning should also state that the employee is at risk of a final written warning
if there is no improvement. ACAS says the employee should be told how long the warning
will remain current. It is common for a copy of the warning to be kept on file but
disregarded for disciplinary purposes after a specified period, eg six months. Note that
ACAS’s suggestion that six months is an appropriate period has been moved from its Code
to its informal guide (see above).

•

Final written warning. The employee can be given a final warning, a) because there is no
improvement within the timescale set on the first warning, or b) even if there have been no
prior warnings, if the behaviour is serious enough. The warning should give similar details to
those required on a first warning, but additionally in this case it should indicate the risk of
dismissal if there is no improvement. The final warning should normally be disregarded for
disciplinary purposes after a specified period, eg 12 months. Again, ACAS’s suggestion
that 12 months is an appropriate period is now in its guide but no longer in its Code. For
particularly serious misconduct, especially eg where harassment of work colleagues is
involved, an employer might give a final written warning for 18 months or even two years.

•

Dismissal. If the employee repeats offences or fails to improve after a final warning or if
s/he commits gross misconduct, s/he can be dismissed. Alternatively, the employee’s
contract may allow other sanctions such as a disciplinary transfer or demotion.

Whatever disciplinary procedure applies to the employee, it is likely
to set out stages similar to the above. When deciding whether to
dismiss an employee, the employer may sometimes be able to rely on
the fact that the employee has several live warnings, even if these
concern unrelated offences. However, employers should not
normally rely on warnings which have lapsed after a specified time
under the procedure.15
What level of penalty is appropriate?
22.15

In imposing warnings or dismissing the employee, the employer must
act reasonably, taking account of all the circumstances. The
following factors will be relevant: the employee’s length of service

22.16

and work record; the nature of the job and his/her status; the
seriousness of the employee’s behaviour; any personal mitigating
factors; and the way similar offences by other employees have been
dealt with previously.
Additional factors will be relevant depending on the nature of the
offence.16 It is particularly important not to discriminate because of
race, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, age, disability or
other protected characteristic under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010
during the process. The ACAS Code recommends that, depending on
the circumstances, if disciplinary action is contemplated against an
employee who is a trade union representative, the case should be
discussed at an early stage with an official employed by the union,
after getting the employee’s agreement.

Gross misconduct
22.17

22.18

Particularly serious offences are known as ‘gross misconduct’.
Gross misconduct (if proved) usually means the employee can be
fairly dismissed for a first offence. Fair procedures in the
investigation and disciplinary should be followed in the normal way,
although compensation for unfair dismissal is likely to be reduced if
the employee wins only because of poor procedures. Gross
misconduct also means the employer can dismiss without giving
notice or pay in lieu. This is called ‘summary dismissal’.
Employers tend to use the phrase ‘gross misconduct’ very readily
and this should not be automatically accepted as correct.
Nevertheless, certain types of misconduct would obviously fall
under this category, eg: theft; sexual harassment; or physical
violence. Other examples are likely to be: falsification of records;
serious bullying or harassment; deliberate damage to property;
serious insubordination; bringing the employer into serious
disrepute; serious infringement of health and safety rules; and serious
negligence which causes or may cause loss or damage. The
disciplinary procedure applicable to the employee will probably list
examples of what the employer considers gross misconduct, although
this is unlikely to be an exhaustive list.

Capability issues
22.19

22.20

Depending on the employer’s procedures, an employee’s failure to
perform to the required standard may be dealt with through the
normal disciplinary procedure or (often with public sector
employers) through a separate capability procedure. Many
employers are reluctant to rush to disciplinary action due to poor
performance and often prefer several informal counselling meetings.
Continuing poor performance by the employee may be due to some
underlying domestic or work problems, eg ill-health or being
subjected to harassment. Disability discrimination law under the
EqA 2010 may apply in some circumstances.
The employee should not normally be dismissed for a failure to
meet work standards unless s/he has been given warnings and an
opportunity to improve, with reasonable timescales and targets.
However, employers may be able to dismiss for a single error due to
negligence with very serious consequences. Case-law suggests this
is most likely where there is a danger to the health and safety of
others.17

Appeals
22.21

22.22

The opportunity to appeal against a disciplinary decision is essential
to natural justice. The ACAS Code says employees should be
informed of their right of appeal, and appeals should be heard
without unreasonable delay. The employer’s disciplinary procedure
usually sets out time limits for lodging and dealing with the appeal.
The appeal should be heard by someone appropriate, ideally a
senior manager, who has not been previously involved in the
disciplinary procedure. In small organisations it may not be possible
to find such an individual, in which case the person dealing with the
appeal should act as impartially as possible. Independent arbitration
may be a suitable alternative if agreed by everyone concerned. The
employee is entitled to be represented at the appeal hearing. If new
evidence arises during the appeal, the employee or his/her

22.23

22.24

representative should be given the opportunity to comment and it may
be necessary to adjourn the appeal to investigate.
The employee may appeal on a number of grounds – eg procedural
irregularities, the penalty was too severe, new evidence has come to
light, or it is unfair to believe that the worker had committed the
offence or that his/her work was substandard. The employer’s appeal
procedure may set out a format for the appeal. The ACAS Guide (see
para 22.10 above) says the opportunity to appeal against a
disciplinary decision is ‘essential to natural justice’ and an appeal
should not result in any increase in penalty as this might deter
individuals from appealing. The ACAS Code is less explicit, but its
general tenor suggests appeals are supposed to be for the benefit of
the employee. It will therefore usually be an unfair dismissal to
increase a final written warning to a dismissal on appeal. It will also
be a breach of contract for an employer to increase a disciplinary
penalty on appeal unless the contractual disciplinary procedure
explicitly says that can be done.18
The employee may not want to appeal, feeling it is pointless.
However, that is normally unwise. The ACAS Code seems to expect
employees to appeal if they are unhappy about the decision. They
therefore risk a reduction in their compensation if they win their
tribunal case having failed to appeal. However, if the employee does
not want his/her job back after dismissal, there are dangers in
appealing. This is because the dismissal will usually ‘disappear’
after a successful internal appeal. If that happens, the employee can
no longer bring an unfair dismissal claim. This is the case even if the
employer offers reinstatement to a demoted position or imposes a
final written warning.19 In that situation, all the employee can do is
resign and claim constructive dismissal, eg if the employer’s actions
amount to a breach of trust and confidence.20 However, constructive
dismissal claims tend to be difficult to prove. Exceptionally, if the
lesser sanctions are explicitly prohibited by the contract, the
dismissal will probably still stand.21 The dismissal does not
disappear in the different situation where an employer changes
his/her mind and offers the job back without having been asked and

without the employee having appealed. Such a unilateral change of
mind need not be accepted by the employee.
The employee must be extremely careful not to miss any ET time
limits if s/he intends to bring a claim. The ET claim must be lodged
within the time limit even if the appeal procedure has not been
completed.

22.25

Discriminatory disciplinary action
The employee may be subjected to disciplinary action for a number
of discriminatory reasons, eg:

22.26

•

The employee’s manager is angry with him/her because s/he has rebuffed his/her sexual
approaches.

•

The manager has chosen to bring formal disciplinary proceedings against a black employee
for being late. However, when a white employee was equally late, the manager merely had
an informal word.

•

The employee is accused of inaccurate completion of timesheets. The employee is dyslexic
and finds it difficult to complete forms accurately.

22.27

22.28

If the employee believes s/he is being subjected to disciplinary
action for discriminatory reasons, s/he needs to decide at an early
stage whether to say so at the disciplinary. If the employee later
brings an ET case for discrimination, s/he may lose credibility if
s/he did not raise the issue at the disciplinary. On the other hand,
discrimination is a serious issue to raise which is likely to upset the
employer. The employee risks being victimised as a result of raising
the issue, and work relations may deteriorate badly. Although
victimisation is unlawful, it can be hard to prove. The employee
needs to consider whether s/he has sufficient objective evidence to
prove the discrimination and whether s/he wants to take on this issue.
If the employee does decide to raise the issue, s/he should do so in
writing prior to the disciplinary hearing. An employer may say later
that the issue of discrimination was never raised at the disciplinary.
There is also a possible risk of reduction in compensation under the
ACAS Code if the employee unreasonably fails to raise the issue of
discrimination with his/her employer before going to tribunal.

22.29

Regarding discriminatory handling of disciplinary action, see para
22.37.

Grievances
22.30

22.31

22.32

The purpose of a grievance procedure is to give employees a way to
raise issues with the management about their working environment or
work relationships. An individual employee bringing a formal
grievance, especially if it is on a controversial subject such as
discrimination, does risk upsetting his/her manager. The employee
needs to be clear about what s/he is trying to achieve. For those
interested in mediation, there is an interesting guide: Mediation: a
guide for trade union representatives from ACAS and the Trades
Union Congress (TUC).22
The ACAS Code does not explicitly state that employees must
bring grievances where they have concerns, but it gives that
impression by saying employees should raise the matter formally
where they have been unable to resolve a grievance informally.23
There is therefore a risk of compensation being reduced if the
employee wins any case when s/he had not first brought an internal
grievance. It is unclear whether it would be considered a breach of
the Code not to attempt an informal grievance before raising a formal
one, although the wording does not seem specific enough to make that
compulsory, and it would be a harsh requirement.
If an employee does raise a grievance, s/he has an implied
contractual right to have it dealt with promptly.24 The ACAS Code
should also be followed, but it is only triggered where the grievance
is in writing.25 The Code sets out very basic guidance to employers
on handling grievances. It says employees should raise grievances
formally and without unreasonable delay if they have not been able
to resolve the matter informally. The formal grievance should be
raised with a manager who is not the subject of the complaint.
Employers should deal with grievances consistently and promptly.
Employees should appeal where they feel their grievance has not
been satisfactorily resolved.

22.33

22.34

22.35

22.36

Employers’ grievance procedures often have more than one appeal
stage. The stages may entail either one-to-one meetings, where the
employee can be accompanied by a colleague or representative, or
full hearings with witnesses, rather like a disciplinary hearing. The
latter model is more common in the public sector where trade union
representation is available. Some employers have different
grievance procedures for different issues, eg the normal procedure
plus different procedures for bullying, discrimination, sexual
harassment or collective grievances. They may also have a special
procedure for whistleblowing under the Public Interest Disclosure
Act 1998.26
Where an employee raises a grievance during a disciplinary
process, the ACAS Code simply says the disciplinary process ‘may’
be temporarily suspended in order to deal with the grievance.27 If the
grievance and disciplinary are related, it ‘may be appropriate’ to
deal with both together. However, if the employer decides to go
ahead with a disciplinary hearing on a related matter, and dismisses
the employee at a time when a grievance appeal is still outstanding,
it will not necessarily be unfair.28
In an ideal world, where grievances concern proposed changes to
an employee’s working conditions or duties, the ‘status quo’ will be
maintained until the grievance procedure has been completed.
However, unless the grievance procedure explicitly says this is the
position, the employee will be on weak ground if the employer
insists on instructions being followed immediately. The employee
cannot unilaterally insist on the status quo if the employer is acting
within the contract and agrees to reconsider if the grievance
succeeds. In such a situation, it can be fair to dismiss an employee
who is refusing lawful instructions to carry out different duties
pending the final outcome of the grievance.29 The position is more
complicated if the changes which the employer wishes to make are
outside the contract, as one then gets into the realms of an employee’s
rights on unilateral variation.30
If an employee intends to bring an ET claim regarding the subjectmatter of a grievance, s/he must do so within the ET time limit for the

relevant legal right (eg discrimination or pay deductions) even if the
grievance procedure has not been completed.

Discriminatory handling of disciplinary or
grievance procedures
Employers may be guilty of further discrimination or victimisation in
the way they deal with an employee’s grievance related to
discrimination, for example by failing to investigate properly or
taking an exceptionally long time to deal with the matter, compared
with how they would normally deal with a grievance. In addition, it
is sometimes necessary with a disabled employee to make
reasonable adjustments to the disciplinary process, eg by allowing
an interpreter or signer or, for someone with learning disabilities,
adopting a particularly informal and unthreatening manner and
process.

Checklist: jurisdictions covered by the ACAS
compensation regime
The ACAS compensation regime applies to jurisdictions set out in
Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act (TULR(C)A)
1992 Sch A2. Remember that in all cases, the claimant must be an
employee. Almost the same jurisdictions are covered by the rules on
compensation for failing to provide a section 1 statement of
particulars under Employment Act 2002 Sch 5 (see para 1.26). There
are a few obscure jurisdictions set out in Sch A2, but the ones you
are most likely to come across are:

22.38

•

discrimination law, ie claims under EqA 2010 and previous equality legislation;

•

claims in respect of trade union membership and activities under TULR(C)A 1992 ss145A,
145B, 146, Sch A1 para 156;

•

unauthorised deductions from pay (including to recover pay below the minimum wage);

•

ET claims which can be made under WTR 1998 reg 30, regarding breaks and annual leave,
etc;

•

claims regarding detriment for taking up rights in connection with the minimum wage under
National Minimum Wage Act 1998 s24;

•

redundancy pay;

•

unfair dismissal (including most automatic unfair dismissals);

•

detriment (action short of dismissal) on any of the grounds listed in Employment Rights Act
(ERA) 1996 s48, ie for: whistleblowing; being an employee representative or trustee of an
occupational pension scheme; for pregnancy or maternity; taking up rights in relation to
maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, dependant leave, parental leave, parental
bereavement leave, flexible working, Sunday working, health and safety, study leave for
young workers (special rules), under the WTR 1998, in relation to jury service, tax credits.
Chapter 6 gives more detail of the precise protection against detriment under these
categories;

•

breach of contract arising or outstanding on termination, eg notice pay;

•

detriment connected with a prohibited blacklist.31

The right to be accompanied to disciplinary and
grievance hearings
The statutory right
22.39

Where a worker32 is invited or required to attend a disciplinary or
grievance hearing and reasonably requests to be accompanied at the
hearing, the employer must allow the worker to choose a trade union
representative or another of the employer’s workers to accompany
him/her.33 The choice of companion is up to the worker, not the
employer, and, provided the companion falls within the relevant
categories, need not be a reasonable choice.34 This companion may
address the hearing and confer with the worker during the hearing.
The companion may put and sum up the worker’s case and may
respond on the worker’s behalf to any view expressed at the hearing,
but s/he may not answer questions on behalf of the worker.35 A
disciplinary hearing means a hearing which could result in a formal
warning or the taking of some other action.36 Previous editions of the
ACAS Code on Disciplinary and Grievances Procedures considered
that hearings or meetings which could only result in informal
warnings and/or counselling would not be covered. The current
Code does not explicitly address this point. However, some
‘informal’ warnings take on the characteristics of formal warnings

22.40

22.41

22.42

22.43

and do attract the right to representation, eg where the informal
warning is in writing, with a specified time before lapsing, and can
be taken into account if further offences are committed.37 A purely
investigatory, as opposed to disciplinary, meeting is unlikely to be
covered.38 A meeting held to inform workers of their impending
redundancy also would not be covered.39
The employer must allow a worker to take time off during working
hours to accompany another of the employer’s workers.40 If the
chosen person cannot attend the proposed time for the hearing, the
employer must postpone the hearing to any reasonable time suggested
by the worker within five working days of the original date.
The ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance
Procedures41 not only refers to this right but adds that employees
should be advised of their right to be accompanied, when notified of
a disciplinary hearing. This means there may be a compensatory
uplift of up to 25 per cent where, eg, the employee wins a case of
unfair dismissal or discriminatory disciplinary action, and the
employer had not advised of the right or permitted the employee to
be accompanied. Remember also that the worker’s own disciplinary
policy, especially in unionised industries, may give similar rights to
representation, but without the restrictions.
A worker can complain to an ET if the statutory right is denied.
The ET can award compensation of up to two weeks’ pay.42 A
worker must not be subjected to any detriment because s/he has tried
to exercise this right or has accompanied another worker. It would
also be automatically unfair dismissal to dismiss an employee for
this reason.43
Note that the statutory right to be accompanied under ERelA 1999
s10 is technically a separate right from the right not to be unfairly
dismissed. It is very likely that an employer’s failure to comply with
section 10 will make any dismissal unfair, but that does not
automatically follow. Moreover, an employer can still act unfairly in
procedural terms even if s/he has not broken the section 10 rules, eg
if his/her refusal to postpone the disciplinary hearing for more than

five days so that the worker’s representative can attend is
unreasonable.44

The right to legal representation
22.44

Workers do not usually have the right to legal representation in an
internal disciplinary or grievance unless explicitly given that right in
their own contract of employment. However, a worker may have
such a right as a result of Article 6 of the European Convention on
Human Rights45 (right to a fair trial) where the outcome of the
internal disciplinary could affect his/her right to practise his/her
profession in the future.

STAGES OF THE BASIC PROCEDURE
This is a summary and should be read together with chapters 20–21 as applicable.

1

Interview worker; take statement; check all documents; check time limits and diarise.

2

If appropriate, request written reasons for dismissal and await reply. (See para 20.10.)

3

In a case under the Equality Act (EqA) 2010, send employer a non-statutory questionnaire and
chase up any failure to reply. (See para 21.2.)

4

Except in unusual cases where Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) Early
Conciliation (EC) does not apply, notify ACAS under the EC procedure within the tribunal time
limit for starting a case. (See para 20.16.)

5

Where EC fails, obtain EC certificate from ACAS and start tribunal case within necessary time
period thereafter. (See para 20.56.)

6

Start case by taking or sending the claim (ET1) to the appropriate tribunal office or submitting it
online. (See para 20.43.)

7

The ET will send an acknowledgement with a case number and stating whether the claim has
been accepted. Subsequent correspondence with the ET goes to the relevant regional office.

8

The ET will send the ET1 to the employer and will send a copy of the employer’s response
(ET3) to the worker’s representative or to the worker direct, if unrepresented. Expect this
roughly four weeks after the acknowledgement (time limits apply). Diarise likely date ET3 is due
and query with ET (or consider asking for a ‘rule 21’ judgment) if not then received.

9

When the ET3 is received, write to the employer asking for any necessary additional information
and any key documents. Set a time limit, usually 14 days. (See para 20.104.)

10

If the information is not received, write to the ET with a copy of the request and ask for an
order. Copy the ET application to the employer and tell the ET this has been done. The ET will
send any order it makes to the employer and a copy to the worker’s representative.

11

If the employer does not supply the information as ordered, write to the ET asking that the
employer be requested to show cause why the ET3 should not be struck out.

12

In England and Wales, the ET will probably send out a standard case management letter at an
early stage (often at stage 7 or 8), setting timescales for disclosure, exchange of witness
statements, preparation of a schedule of loss etc. (See appendix C at C6 for an example.)
Diarise the steps set out by the ET and prepare well in advance. This does not replace the need
to make any specific requests and stages 9–11 above may still apply. (See para 20.104.)

13

In a discrimination case, chase up any failure to answer the non-statutory questionnaire.

14

The ET will notify each side of the hearing date, either when forwarding the ET1 to the
employer (stage 8) or after the ET3 is received. Minimum 14 days’ notice must be given. Inform
ET immediately if the date is unsuitable.

15

An ACAS officer will be allocated to the case at the start and will contact the worker’s
representative and the employer. This is separate from the EC process before a case starts.
Negotiation can be through ACAS or direct with the employer. Once an agreement is concluded,
it becomes binding if each side has confirmed it verbally with ACAS. ACAS then tells the ET
that the case has been settled. (Check that ACAS has done this.) Alternatively, a binding
settlement is reached when authorised representatives sign a settlement agreement (formerly
called compromise agreement). (See para 20.268 onwards.)

16

If using ACAS, the officer will send a COT3 form for signature. This contains the agreed terms
of settlement. Make sure that the worker at all stages knows the terms. If there is no settlement,
the case will go to hearing. ACAS is unlikely to be accessible for any settlement agreed on the
day of the hearing, but the ET should be asked to make an order in the agreed terms.

17

In good time for the hearing, write to the ET to request any witness orders that are wanted. (See
para 20.136.)

18

Prior to the hearing, prepare trial bundles in agreement with the employer. Each page of the
bundle should be numbered. Make sufficient copies or ask the employer to. (See para 20.174
onwards.)

19

If it has been ordered or there is agreement to do so, exchange witness statements with the other
side. (See para 20.186.)

20

During the hearing, the ET will either hear evidence relating to liability and remedies
(compensation etc) all at once or, more usually, will start by hearing evidence just on liability and
then listen to evidence on compensation if the worker wins. Be prepared for both.

21

At the end of the hearing, the ET will give its judgment or reserve judgment and write to the
parties later. If ET gives oral judgment, request written reasons at the hearing or within the
specified time limit afterwards if thinking of appealing. But bear in mind that written reasons go
on the public register.

22

Remember and diarise time limits for reconsideration (14 days) and appeal (42 days) if
unsuccessful.

23

If successful, diarise when the money from the judgment or settlement is due and chase/enforce
as appropriate. Interest runs from the date of the award if unpaid within 14 days.

Variations:

a)

The ET may hold a preliminary hearing simply to discuss case management arrangements
(especially in discrimination cases) with the representatives at any stage (or with the parties, if
they are unrepresented), just to sort out what needs to be done, eg, whether an order should be
made for additional information, disclosure of documents etc. (See para 21.50.)

b)

The ET may hold a preliminary hearing on issues of ‘jurisdiction’ at an early stage which is
prepared for and conducted like a full hearing except that it is confined to the jurisdictional or
preliminary issue, eg, in an unfair dismissal case, whether the claimant is an employee or in a
disability discrimination case, whether the worker has a ‘disability’. Alternatively, such issues
may be left to the full hearing. (See para 20.161.)

c)

The ET may hold a preliminary hearing, usually at an early stage, at which the claims or
individual allegations may be struck out because they have no reasonable prospects of success or
a costs deposit ordered because they have little reasonable prospect of success. (See para
20.165.)

d)

Equal value cases under the EqA 2010 – the basic procedure applies but there are also additional
special steps (see chapter 5).

e)

Any preliminary hearings and/or the full hearing may be held ‘remotely’ ie on a vide platform (or
by telephone conferencing for a purely case management preliminary hearing). If so, the tribunal
will want electronic documents, but witnesses will still find it better to be given hard copy
documents.

A2

INITIAL INTERVIEW WITH WORKER SEEKING ADVICE ON
DISMISSAL

1

Check what worker wants.

2

Check whether correct contractual/statutory notice was given or pay in lieu (unless gross
misconduct).

3

Check whether any outstanding wages or holiday pay are due.

4

Check date of dismissal and time limits for possible ET claims/ACAS EC notification. Inform
worker and diarise. Where there is a claim of discrimination, prepare a brief chronology, note and
diarise the time limit of the last act of discrimination, if it is a continuing act of discrimination, and
the earliest act of discrimination if there are several self-contained acts.

5

Check whether worker qualifies for unfair dismissal (sufficient continuous service, status as
employee, whether s/he was ‘dismissed’).

6

If applicable and if worker qualifies, consider redundancy pay claim.

7

Check possibility of unlawful discrimination (no continuous service required; need not be an
‘employee’ working under a contract of employment).

8

Where likely, eg, where there is a sex discrimination issue, check for unequal pay.

9

Check pay slips. If worker was given none, consider claim for failure to give itemised pay
statements. Ask tax authorities and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to investigate
contributions record so that credited contributions can be requested if necessary. Consider risk of
illegal contract.

10

Obtain all relevant documents from worker and take full statement.

11

If appropriate, write initial letter to employer requesting written reasons for dismissal, P45 and
monies due.

12

Consider whether anything can be done immediately to secure a good open reference.

13

Check whether worker has appealed.

14

Advise as to social security benefits or refer on for this advice.

A3

INTERVIEW OF WORKER WITH RACE (OR SEX)
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM
The following list suggests points that should be established by an adviser when
interviewing a worker with a potential race discrimination claim. It can be adapted for sex
discrimination cases. The suggestions are for guidance only and should not be followed
rigidly. In each case, the facts and what needs to be proved must be carefully considered.

•

What are the key discriminatory actions by the employer which the worker is complaining about,
eg lack of promotion, disciplinary action, dismissal?

•

Find out whether the worker believes his/her treatment is because of his/her race or the race of
someone else. Ask the worker why s/he thinks s/he was dismissed/disciplined/not promoted or
appointed. This helps establish whether the worker believes it is race discrimination, although it
may be necessary to ask more overtly. It also helps draw out any non-discriminatory explanation
for the employer’s conduct.

•

Unless it is obvious, establish what is the worker’s nationality, ethnic or national origin (as
relevant under the EqA 2010), ie what ‘racial’ group is the employer discriminating against?

•

Explore the evidence: ask what makes the worker think s/he has been discriminated against.
Explain that this is a good question to draw out evidence indicating discrimination.

•

Is there an actual comparator? Is there is a direct comparison with a white worker who has been
treated more favourably in comparable circumstances?

•

Establish who made the relevant decisions and what is the decision-making hierarchy; establish
whether any discriminatory patterns among the workforce can be attributed to the same
decision-makers (eg, the expression of prejudice by a senior manager is relevant only if that
manager has some control over this worker’s fate). Avoid ‘conspiracy theories’, eg, accusing too
many senior managers and staff of racism.

•

Expressly ask the worker whether any racist remarks were made by any relevant manager,
either directly to the worker or in his/her hearing.

•

Ask whether relevant managers demonstrated prejudice in any other way, eg, by differential
treatment of staff according to their ‘race’.

•

Try to establish patterns. Patterns in the way the worker has been treated by certain persons in
the past compared with how staff of a different racial group, eg, white, are treated, and in the
way other staff of the same ‘racial’ group are treated and their position in the workforce.

•

Establish now rather than later if there are any holes in the patterns, eg, if the managers accused
have in the past made senior appointments of persons in the same ‘racial’ group as the worker,

or if others of the same ‘racial group’ are generally highly placed in the employing organisation.
Also look at who appointed/promoted the worker in the past and why, if it is the same manager
who is now discriminating.
•

Assess whether there are non-racial explanations for events, eg, the person promoted above the
worker was better qualified or the worker was unpopular for reasons unconnected with his/her
‘race’.

•

If there is a history of discrimination, establish when it started and explore whether the start date
makes sense, eg because a new manager took over or because it was the first time a promotion
situation arose.

•

Ask whether the worker ever alleged race discrimination and whether that can be proved. Ask
for details and the employer’s reaction. (This is relevant to credibility of the worker, and of the
employer if no action was taken, and to any victimisation claim.)

•

Ask if the employer has an equal opportunities policy and whether it was ever brought to the
worker’s attention.

•

Establish whether direct or indirect discrimination, or both, is possible.

•

Establish whether victimisation took place, ie, whether the worker alleged discrimination in the
past and/or during incidents leading to dismissal and/or in any disciplinary hearing prior to
dismissal.

•

Watch out for other forms of discrimination, eg, sex discrimination – in addition to or instead of
race discrimination.

•

Establish all acts of discrimination within the last three months (eg, failed promotion applications;
unfair appraisals; warnings; dismissal). These can be the basis of the claim.

•

Establish all acts of discrimination or evidence of prejudicial attitudes throughout the worker’s
employment. (Although these cannot usually form the basis of a claim if more than three months
ago, they can be supporting evidence for the main claim. It is also possible that a sequence of
incidents would amount to a continuing act of discrimination.) Be careful not to include
everything which in hindsight the worker thinks was unfair. Focus on incidents which indicate
different treatment.

•

Establish evidential strength – witnesses, documents and matters from which inferences could be
drawn.

•

Establish what information could be usefully obtained on a non-statutory questionnaire. Ask
worker about distribution (and treatment – promotions/dismissals, etc) of workers of different
racial groups in the workforce.

•

Establish what the worker wants (particularly if still employed).

A4

INTERVIEW OF WORKER WHO HAS BEEN MADE
REDUNDANT
A worker who has been made redundant may choose only to ask his/her adviser about the
level of redundancy pay. However, s/he may have other rights, depending in part on
whether s/he is an employee. The following list suggests suitable areas for exploring and
should be read in conjunction with chapter 8.

1

Reasonable time off with pay during notice period to look for fresh employment.

2

Redundancy pay:
•

Check worker is eligible for statutory redundancy pay (employee; at least two years’ service
etc).

•

Check the calculation.

•

Check if s/he has a greater contractual entitlement and any applicable NHS/local government
schemes.

•

May s/he lose the right to redundancy pay because s/he unreasonably refused an offer of
suitable alternative employment made before the expiry of his/her contract?

•

May s/he lose the right to redundancy pay if s/he has left before the expiry of his/her notice
period?1

NOTE: There are rules as to the procedure to be followed if the worker wants to leave early
without losing his/her pay.
3

Unfair dismissal:
•

Check worker is eligible to claim (employee; sufficient continuous service; has been
dismissed in legal sense). Be careful to check that a dismissal has taken place as opposed to
an agreed termination, eg, in some early retirement/ voluntary redundancy situations.

•

Would the worker win? A redundancy dismissal may be unfair if:
–

there was no genuine redundancy situation and the employer had other reasons for
dismissing the worker;

–

unfair selection criteria were used, or they were unfairly applied;

–

the employer did not consider alternative employment;

–

poor procedures were followed and there was no consultation with the individual or
union.

•

If the worker was made redundant after failing to obtain an alternative post on a
reorganisation, the dismissal may be unfair if:

•

–

the employer had agreed a matching policy with the union, but failed to follow it;

–

the new post was anyway very similar to the worker’s previous post;

–

the assessment process used was unsuitable or not marked fairly;

–

there was no consultation at the outset with any recognised union as to a fair process;

–

the worker was denied the right of appeal.

How much compensation is the worker likely to receive?

NOTE: If the worker received a large contractual or voluntary redundancy payment or if s/he
obtained a new job very quickly, his/her unfair dismissal claim may be worth little or nothing.
4

Was the worker selected for redundancy for an automatically unfair reason (see chapter 6)? For
example, if the worker was dismissed for a reason related to pregnancy or maternity, this may be
automatic unfair dismissal, which does not require her to have had any minimum length of
service.
NOTE: If the worker is made redundant while on maternity leave, she must be offered any
suitable vacancy.

5

Unlawful discrimination:
•

Check eligibility. (Much wider than for unfair dismissal or statutory redundancy pay.)

•

Has the worker been selected for redundancy because of his/her race, religion, sex, gender
reassignment, sexual orientation, age, disability, or because she is pregnant or has taken
maternity leave?
–

Have objective criteria been used and objectively applied?

–

Would the worker have been selected if s/he had been of a different race, religion, sex,
sexual orientation, age, or not disabled? (If not, it may be direct discrimination.)

•

Has the worker been selected on an indirectly discriminatory criterion which cannot be
justified, eg, LIFO (last in, first out); part-timers first; ‘temps’ or ‘casuals’ first; where these
groups are disproportionately black or female?

•

Have reasonable adjustments been made to the redundancy selection procedure or criteria so
that a disabled worker is not put at a disadvantage, eg by discounting disability-related
absences from a selection criterion based on attendance record?

•

Has the worker been selected for redundancy because of recent complaints about
discrimination or harassment which have upset the employer? This would be victimisation.

•
6

Is access to or calculation of the redundancy payment package discriminatory?

Redundancies on a transfer:
•

Consider whether or not the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (TUPE) apply.

•

Consider whether claim should be made against new or old employer.

7

Trade union or employee representatives’ consultation.
•

For collective redundancies.

•

Where the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations apply.

NOTE: Any claim for breaking consultation rules is brought by the trade union or, if no union is
recognised, by appropriate employee representatives on behalf of the employees. If there is no
trade union and no employee representatives were elected, an individual may be able to claim.

A5

INITIAL INTERVIEW OF WORKER WITH POSSIBLE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT CLAIM
This is a sensitive area, with difficulties of law, evidence and the worker’s feelings. The
checklist below suggests that the information which needs to be obtained to make an
informed judgment about whether the worker can bring a legal case (or even risk
speaking out). It may be best not to ask all the questions in the first interview, but to fix
another meeting the next day or very soon after, to speak in more detail.
The last part of the checklist suggests how such an interview should be conducted. The
same questions will not always be appropriate. The adviser must be thorough in his/her
questioning and listen carefully to the answers. This is to ensure that the worker is
consistent throughout any grievance and ET case which s/he may take. Explain to the
worker some of the legal complexities so s/he understands why you are asking the
questions.

1

Questions to find out background information:
•

The harasser’s job title and working relationship with the worker.

•

The nature of the working day. How often the worker has contact with the harasser.

•

The general office situation, layout and presence of other workers.

•

The worker’s start date and disciplinary record. [This is sensitive: explain the question about
the worker’s record is only to see how vulnerable s/he is if management raise the issue.]

2

Questions about the harassment:
•

When the harassment started.

•

Details and dates of the harassment (verbal and physical). [This requires a sensitive
approach as the worker may be embarrassed, particularly with a representative of the
opposite sex.]

•

Establish what is normal acceptable office behaviour and where the line is drawn.

•

Are there witnesses? Has the worker kept a diary? Has s/he seen/told his/her GP; any
recruitment agency; family, friends or acquaintances?

•

Has the harasser done the same thing to other workers? Have others complained to
management?

•

Has the worker said explicitly to the harasser or made it clear in any other way that s/he
does not welcome the behaviour? [Many kinds of behaviour are obviously unwelcome and it
is not essential that the worker has said as much to the harasser, but it is helpful if s/he has.

Note that although this is important information to know, it is extremely sensitive as the
worker may feel s/he is to blame if s/he has not said anything to the harasser. Therefore, do
not ask this question until late in the interview when confidence is built. This also gives the
worker time to raise it him/herself, which is preferable. If it is necessary to raise the issue
first, be sure to give prior reassurance that it would be understandable if the worker had not
felt able to say anything.]
•

If the worker did tell the harasser, how and when did s/he do so and what was his/her
reaction?

•

Has the worker raised the matter with anyone in management or told anyone else before?
[This question also needs prior reassurance.]

3

Action:
•

What does the worker want to do? [This is the most important question of all, and however
bad the situation is, it is not up to the adviser to impose a solution. Discuss the options
including taking a grievance, going to the ET plus time limits, informal approach to the
harasser, doing nothing but keeping a diary.]

4

Taking a sensitive approach:
•

Take the matter seriously and give it the necessary time.

•

Be friendly and supportive but formal. Do not be authoritarian or too informal. Both could
replicate the harasser’s behaviour.

•

Take a clear role and explain why sensitive questions are asked before asking them.

•

In the first interview, allow the worker to give a broad picture before going back (in this
interview or a subsequent interview) to ask for more detail.

•

Do not try to get all the information in the first interview – focus on building confidence
(although you must find out enough to ensure you do not miss a legal time limit). Ask more
sensitive questions and deal with possible counter-allegations in later interviews after
confidence in the adviser has been established.

•

To maintain confidence, arrange swift follow-up interviews at the first interview. This is also
essential before memories fade and witnesses lose interest.

•

In case the worker is embarrassed, offer the opportunity to write down what has happened
before discussing it. [NOTE: this is not a substitute for spending time talking to the worker.]

•

If possible, offer the worker the chance to talk to an adviser of the same sex. [NOTE: this
must not be seen as if the representative is not interested or concerned about the matter.]

•

Provide reassurance that the worker is entitled to feel upset, that the harasser has behaved
unacceptably and that the worker has done nothing wrong.

•

Reassure the worker on confidentiality and that nothing will be done without his/her
permission. It is important to take notes, but ask permission first.

•

Discuss various options, taking account of what the worker wants, offering appropriate
support whatever s/he decides. Take a participative and consultative approach. Address any
fear of reprisals.

•

Raise with the worker his/her feelings and health and direct him/her to sources of support.
The adviser should not attempt to act as an amateur counsellor or suggest the worker needs
counselling/psychiatric help in a way which could be understood as meaning the adviser
thinks there is something wrong with the worker. Suggestions of sources of support are not
an alternative to concrete remedial action.

DO NOT:
•

Make assumptions.

•

Suggest that the worker could be to blame in inviting the harassment.

•

Blame the worker for not confronting the harasser or telling the union or management earlier.

•

Suggest that the worker may be misinterpreting events or being oversensitive.

•

Express any view as to the effect on the harasser or the harasser’s spouse/partner if the
worker makes an allegation.

•

Pressurise the worker into taking any form of action.

•

If the adviser is a union representative, s/he should not say that s/he knows the harasser and
is surprised s/he has acted in that way, or express concern that the harasser is a worker of
the same union.

A6

INTERVIEW OF WORKER DISMISSED FOR POOR WORK,
WITH A VIEW TO ASSESSING POTENTIAL CLAIMS FOR (A)
UNFAIR DISMISSAL; (B) DISMISSAL IN FACT BECAUSE
SHE IS PREGNANT; OR (C) DISMISSAL IN FACT BECAUSE
S/HE IS BLACK
The following list suggests areas for questioning common to many dismissals on grounds
of capability or conduct and is designed to highlight the additional questions necessary
where discrimination due to pregnancy or race is suspected. Note that questions
concerning discrimination are designed to find out if the worker has been treated
differently, not just unfairly. The list is for guidance only.

Unfair dismissal
1

Questions to test eligibility, eg, length of continuous service, whether the worker is an employee.

2

Questions to establish the sequence of events and disciplinary process followed leading up to
dismissal.

3

Obtain documents worker has: contract of employment; disciplinary / capability procedure;
dismissal letter; other letters relating to the events leading to dismissal; previous warning letters;
previous appraisals.

4

Questions to establish the worker’s previous work record: previous disciplinary / capability
hearings; warnings (alive or lapsed); verbal criticisms; appraisals; thank-you letters.

5

The worker’s job and duties. The hierarchy and other staff in his/her department.

6

The nature of the allegations against the worker and his/her response – in the disciplinary /
capability hearing and, if different, to you.

7

If relevant, any training the worker has had. Has s/he recently been promoted? If so, what was
his/her experience prior to promotion and is s/he being given support and guidance?

8

Dates of all relevant facts plus date of dismissal. (Relevant to show the pattern of events but
also for time limits.)

9

What does the worker want to do?

Pregnancy dismissal – extra questions to unfair dismissal
list
1

Note that the worker does not need to be an employee in the unfair dismissal sense or to have
any minimum service to claim pregnancy discrimination.

2

Does the worker think dismissal was due to her pregnancy? If so, what makes the worker think
that? (This is a useful question, but explain that it is useful to know what she has in mind and that
she is not being disbelieved.)

3

Questions to establish whether and when the employer and relevant manager knew the worker
was pregnant, eg:
•

When is the baby due?

•

When did the worker tell the employer she was pregnant? Who did she tell? Was it verbal or
in writing?

•

Has the worker had time off for pregnancy-related ill-health? If so, when and who did she
tell?

•

Has the worker had time off for antenatal care? Have there been discussions about
maternity leave or benefits? With whom? When?

4

Questions to establish if the employer or relevant manager is hostile towards the worker’s
pregnancy, eg:
•

In any of the above discussions or at any other time, has the employer expressed any
irritation about time off or any other aspect of the pregnancy?

•

What did the employer say when the worker first told him/her of her pregnancy?

•

Has there been any problem getting time off for antenatal care?

•

Has the employer/manager’s behaviour or attitude towards the worker changed in any way
since s/he found out the worker was pregnant?

•

What is the employer’s general attitude towards pregnant workers? What about the
particular manager(s) the worker is now dealing with?

5

Questions to establish either that the worker has not performed poor work at all or that other
non-pregnant workers have performed equally poor work (or done worse things), yet have not
been dismissed. Also ask:
•

How readily does the employer usually discipline or dismiss workers?

•

What sort of offences are usually considered dismissable?

•

Compare the disciplinary procedure applied to the worker with any written procedure and
with the normal practice adopted by the employer.

6

Where the pregnancy discrimination falls short of dismissal, eg, disciplinary action or nonpromotion, ensure the worker seeks advice on maternity-related matters, eg, how to preserve her
right to return after maternity leave, maternity benefits, rights to time off for antenatal care, if
relevant, rights to health and safety suspension.

7

Regarding what the worker wants to do, will she want to return to work there after her maternity
leave? (This may affect how the matter is handled.)
NOTE: Adverse treatment due to pregnancy may also be sex discrimination. For this a worker
need not be an employee.
Also watch for dates of all adverse treatment as time limits for sex discrimination will run from
each detrimental act.

Race discrimination – extra questions to unfair dismissal
list
1

Note that the worker need not be an employee in the unfair dismissal sense or to have any
minimum service to claim race discrimination.

2

Does the worker believe s/he has genuinely been dismissed for poor work or for some other
reason?

3

Does the worker think s/he would have been dismissed if s/he was white? If so, what makes the
worker think that? (This is a useful question, but explain that it is useful to know what s/he has in
mind and that s/he is not being disbelieved.)

4

Questions regarding the ethnic breakdown of the workforce and particularly of the relevant
managers.

5

Questions to compare the general treatment of black and white workers, eg, as to the level of
disciplinary action and dismissals; recruitment; promotion; general day-to-day behaviour by
management. Has anyone else complained of race discrimination previously?

6

Questions to establish either that the worker has not performed poor work at all or that other
white workers have performed equally poor work (or done worse things), yet have not been
dismissed. Also ask:
•

How readily does the employer usually discipline or dismiss workers?

•

What sort of offences are usually considered dismissable?

•

Compare the disciplinary procedure applied to the worker with any written procedure and
with the normal practice adopted by the employer.

7

Questions about the previous treatment of the worker, eg, has the worker been subjected to
different or racist treatment or remarks? Has the worker previously alleged race discrimination –
if so, when and what happened?

8

Dates of all material incidents because the race discrimination time limit runs from each act of
discrimination.

9

See also checklist A3 above for interviewing workers generally with potential race discrimination
claims.

A7

ET1: DIRECT AND INDIRECT RACE DISCRIMINATION;
UNFAIR DISMISSAL
Sample details of unfair dismissal and race discrimination claim for para 8.2 of ET1 form

1

The respondent operates a chain of fast-food restaurants in central London. The claimant
worked as manager at various branches since his engagement in 2012. At the time of his
dismissal, the claimant was working at the Piccadilly branch.

2

The claimant is of Algerian national origin.

3

On 5 November 2020, the claimant was told that his employment would be terminated by reason
of redundancy on the closure of his branch on 17 November 2020.

4

The claimant was not consulted at any time prior to his dismissal as to the possibility of
employment at any of the respondents’ other restaurants. Other staff in the claimant’s branch
who were white and of British national origin were redeployed within the respondents’
organisation.

5

During a conversation in September 2020, the respondent’s area manager told the claimant that
the respondent had started to ‘professionalise’ its operation and bring in managers with catering
qualifications from recognised UK colleges.

6

Having regard to the size and administrative resources of the respondent, the claimant’s dismissal
was unfair. The claimant was unfairly selected for redundancy. Furthermore, the respondent
failed to consult with the claimant concerning the possibilities of alternative employment and
failed to offer such employment.

7

Furthermore, the claimant was directly discriminated against in his dismissal because of his race
contrary to sections 9 and 13 of the Equality Act 2010.

8

Further or in the alternative, the claimant was subjected to indirect discrimination in his dismissal
contrary to sections 9 and 19 of the Equality Act 2010 in that the respondents required that he
hold a UK catering qualification.

A8

ET1: DIRECT RACE DISCRIMINATION AND VICTIMISATION;
UNFAIR DISMISSAL
Sample details of unfair dismissal and race discrimination claim for para 8.2 of ET1 form

1

The claimant was employed as a project officer with the respondent council in March 2019. The
claimant is black British.

2

In March 2020, one year after the claimant’s appointment, a white British project officer (Sally
Ward) was engaged. Ms Ward had the same grade, pay and job title as the claimant.

3

Throughout her employment, the claimant received only administrative tasks, and was not
permitted to write publicity or represent the department at external meetings. In contrast, Ms
Ward was given those opportunities.

4

On 30 May 2021, the claimant complained to the head of the department, Alex Stern, that her
immediate supervisor was giving the best work to the white project officer, whereas she was
becoming deskilled. The claimant stated she believed the differential treatment was on grounds
of her race. Mr Stern did not take any action as a result of this complaint and appeared to be
angry.

5

On 25 July 2021 the project officers were reduced from two to one and the claimant was made
redundant.

6

The claimant suffered direct discrimination because of race contrary to sections 9 and 13 of the
Equality Act 2010:
(a) in the nature of the work which she was allocated;
(b) in Mr Stern’s failure to deal with her complaint;
(c) by making her redundant.

7

Further or in the alternative, the claimant was victimised contrary to section 27 of the Equality
Act 2010 as a result of complaining about race discrimination as set out at paragraph 4 above in
that she was made redundant.

8

In these respects, the claimant compares her treatment with that of Ms Ward and/or with that of
a hypothetical comparator.2

9

Further or alternatively, the claimant was unfairly dismissed.

NON-STATUTORY QUESTIONNAIRE: RACE
DISCRIMINATION (DISMISSAL)
See paras 21.47–21.48 regarding non-statutory questionnaires. In this example, the
summary of complaint at paras 1–6 could also stand as the grounds of an ET1.

Summary of complaint
1

I am of Asian ethnic origin. I started working for the respondent in its West End branch on 6
January 2020. I was promoted to manager in April 2020. Throughout my employment, I received
no warnings of any kind.

2

On 11 May 2021, I was dismissed. I believe this was discrimination. The reason I was given for
my dismissal was that I had claimed taxi fares during the tube strike without permission.

3

In the past I had been given travel fares in difficult travel circumstances and I had also given out
fares to others. I understood this was in accordance with company policy. There was no secrecy
involved, the petty cash slips were signed by myself and sent to head office, and the money was
given to me by the chief cashier.

4

A new area manager was appointed in January 2021. On several occasions he told me to get
more white staff in the shop. My deputy manager and I were both of Asian background. About
half of the remaining staff were white. I told the area manager that I was not prepared to
discriminate. I said that when vacancies arose, I could only appoint the best applicants.

5

In April 2021, my deputy manager was suddenly demoted to the position of salesperson. Then on
9 May 2021 I was called to a disciplinary hearing regarding my claim for taxi fares. The
disciplinary was conducted by the area manager and personnel. I told them I believed this was
race discrimination. On 11 May I received a letter notifying me of my dismissal. I subsequently
appealed to the regional manager. Again I told him I believed it was race discrimination. My
appeal was rejected on 20 May 2021.

6

I believed I was dismissed because I am of Asian ethnic origin and/or because I made
allegations of race discrimination.

A10 NON-STATUTORY QUESTIONNAIRE: RACE
DISCRIMINATION (REDUNDANCY)
See paras 21.47–21.48 regarding non-statutory questionnaires. This summary of
complaint is not written in a form appropriate for the grounds of an ET1.

Summary of complaint
I am Black British. I was one of 200 engineers employed across three sites in the council’s

A11 NON-STATUTORY QUESTIONNAIRE: PREGNANCY
See paras 21.47–21.48 regarding non-statutory questionnaires. This is a sample
questionnaire in a case of dismissal of a pregnant woman, ostensibly on grounds of
capability/conduct, but suspected to be due to pregnancy.

Summary of complaint
1

I have worked as Assistant Manager for Winfield Shoes in their Nottingham Branch since 12
October 2016. Throughout my employment, I received no warnings from my employers, written
or verbal.

2

On 20 October 2020, I informed my manager, Tessa Hennessy, that I was pregnant. On 21
November 2020, I was off sick. I telephoned Jane Baxter of personnel and explained that I
would not be in because I felt sick due to my pregnancy.

3

On 24 November 2020 I was sent a letter requiring me to attend a disciplinary hearing on 26
November 2020. This came out of the blue and was a complete shock to me.

4

At the disciplinary meeting held on 26 November 2020 I was dismissed. The reasons given to me
were poor supervision of staff, poor time-keeping and taking too many personal phone calls.
These allegations were untrue. My appeal to the managing director on 3 December 2020 also
failed. I believe I was dismissed due to my pregnancy.

5

Do you agree with my description of events? If you do not, please would you set out your
version?

Questions
1

Do you accept that I told Tessa Hennessy on or about 20 October 2020 that I was pregnant? If
not, when does Tessa say she first found out I was pregnant and how does she say she found
out?

2

Do you accept that I told Jane Baxter on 21 November 2020, when I telephoned in sick, that I
was pregnant? If not, what does Jane Baxter say I told her?

3

Please list every person within the company who knew before my dismissal that I was pregnant.
In each case, please state when and how they had found out.

4

In respect of the decision to dismiss me, please state:
(a) who took the decision and when;
(b) who was consulted and what were their views;
(c) every reason for my dismissal.

5

In respect of the decision to reject my appeal, please state:
(a) who took the decision and when;
(b) who was consulted and what were their views;
(c) every reason for rejecting my appeal.

6

Please set out every alleged instance with dates of (a) poor staff supervision, (b) poor timekeeping, and (c) receiving personal telephone calls.

7

Please set out the company policy regarding taking personal telephone calls.

8

(a) Was it a verbal or written policy? (b) When was it introduced?

9

Please state all dismissals and disciplinary action by the company since 1 January 2017, stating in
each case:
(a) job title and location of person dismissed;
(b) age of any children under five years;
(c) sex of person dismissed and whether pregnant or on maternity leave at the time;
(d) date and nature of disciplinary action; and
(e) nature of offence.

10

Please state all staff employed in the company as at 27 November 2020 by reference to:
(a) job title/location;
(b) age of children under 5;
(c) sex;
(d) dates when pregnant or on maternity leave during employment with you (indicating which).

11

Please state all staff who have become pregnant or gone onto maternity leave since 1 January
2017 by reference to:
(a) job title/location;
(b) dates of pregnancy or maternity leave (indicating which);
(c) if applicable, termination date and reason for leaving.
Notes for readers:
With reference to questions 1 to 3: In post-dismissal correspondence, the managing
director denied that the company knew the complainant was pregnant prior to her
dismissal. If this happens or if it is possible that the company will deny knowledge, then
questions should be asked to pin down its position.
It will not always be appropriate to ask such blunt questions, but on these facts, it is
possible that early questions will get a truthful answer. If there has been no prior
indication from the employer that s/he will deny knowledge, it may be better not to

encourage denial by such questions. Instead, if the summary of complaint sets out when
the complainant did tell the employer, then the employer’s response should contain any
denial.

A12 NON-STATUTORY QUESTIONNAIRE: SEXUAL
HARASSMENT
See paras 21.47–21.48 regarding non-statutory questionnaires. This is a sample
questionnaire in sexual harassment case.

Summary of complaint
I worked for the council in its Homeless Persons Unit. From September 2017, I was sexually
harassed by her supervisor, Mr Briggs. [Cite incidents.] On 13 February 2021, the complainant
informed personnel of the harassment. An investigation was carried out, during which I was
instructed to remain off work. On 1 March 2021, I was told that the outcome of the investigation
was inconclusive.
On 9 April 2021, I was required by Mr Briggs to attend a disciplinary hearing for poor work

A14 CHECKLIST: IS THE CLAIMANT AN EMPLOYEE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF CLAIMING UNFAIR DISMISSAL?
There is no absolute test which applies to all circumstances, but the following checklist,
read in conjunction with chapter 6, may help.
•

There must be an express or implied contractual agreement between the parties.

•

There must be an irreducible minimum of obligation on each side to offer and accept work.

•

The employer must have a sufficient right of control over what work is done and how. However,
what happens in practice can be misleading.

•

The individual must be obliged to do the work him/herself, but it does not necessarily matter if
s/he has a very restricted right to send substitutes.

•

There must be nothing else which suggests the individual is not an employee.

•

The individual is not necessarily an employee just because there is mutual obligation, sufficient
control and an obligation to do the work personally. The contract must still appear to be a
contract of employment. It is helpful if the individual is well-integrated into the employer’s
business, in terms of how s/he fits in internally and how s/he is seen externally.

•

The labels attached to the relationship by the parties, ie whether or not the individual is called an
employee, and the pay and tax arrangements, are relevant factors, but not conclusive.

•

Where the individual accepts several separate assignments or engagements from a particular
employer but does not have to be offered or to accept work in between the assignments, the
individual may still be working under a contract of employment for the duration of each
assignment. S/he will still need sufficient continuous service to claim unfair dismissal, which will
depend on the rules covering breaks in service (see para 6.22).

•

Applying these principles, agency workers may in theory be an employee of the end-user or the
agency or neither. It is unusual to be an employee of the end-user because there is not usually
any contract (express or implied) directly between the individual and the end-user.

•

When trying to work out what the contract terms are, eg whether there is any mutual obligation
or right to send substitutes, any written contract will be the starting point. However, if the
claimant believes the written contract does not represent the reality of the situation, the tribunal
will look at all the circumstances to ascertain what the real agreement between the parties was.

A15 CHECKLIST ON THE DEFINITION OF ‘DISABILITY’ UNDER
EQUALITY ACT 2010 SECTION 6
NOTE: Unless the worker is obviously covered by the legal definition, it will be important
carefully to interview him/her with the following checklist in mind. See also paras 15.7–
15.35.
•

Check that the worker has an ‘impairment’ which is either physical or mental.

•

Check whether it is a condition which is deemed a disability on diagnosis (HIV; cancer; Multiple
Sclerosis; certified visual impairment).

•

Check that none of the excluded conditions apply.3

•

Check that the impairment has adverse effects on the worker’s ability to carry out normal dayto-day activities.4

•

Check the affected activity is a ‘normal’ activity as opposed to, for example, a highly specialised
hobby or specialist work activity (though normal hobbies and work activities should be covered).5

•

The focus should be on what the worker cannot do, not on what s/he can do.6

•

Check whether the worker’s ability to carry out the normal activity is ‘substantially’ affected, ie,
the effect is clearly more than trivial.7
NOTE: It is unnecessary that the worker is completely unable to carry out the activity. For
example, it is sufficient that:

•

–

the worker can only carry out the activity more slowly than usual;

–

the worker can only carry out the activity in a particular way;8

–

it is tiring or painful to carry out the activity;9

–

the worker has medical advice not to attempt the activity.10

Remember that the worker may have ‘played down’ the true effect of his/her disability on
his/her daily life, or may have adjusted his/her life to avoid the need to carry out the activity.11

•

Remember that if the worker has a progressive condition, s/he is protected as soon as that
condition has any adverse effect, even if that effect is not yet substantial.12

•

Consider whether the worker can only carry out an activity without substantial adverse effect
due to medical treatment or an aid (except for glasses correcting eyesight).13

•

Note: if the worker has a severe disfigurement, it is treated as having substantial adverse effect
on normal day-to-day activities, unless this is a tattoo or ornamental body-piercing.14

•

Consider whether the substantial adverse effect of the impairment on the activity is long-term, ie,
for 12 months or the rest of the worker’s life.15

•

Remember that impairments with recurring substantial effects may be covered, even though the
effect is only for a short period at any one time.16

•

Consider whether it is necessary to seek medical advice or obtain medical evidence on the above
matters.17

A16 DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE EQUALITY ACT
2010 – OVERALL CHECKLIST
Note: This checklist cannot cover every aspect of the law and should be read together with
chapter 15.
•

Is the worker eligible to claim under the EqA 2010?
–

Check the worker is an employee of the kind covered by the EqA 2010 or a job applicant or
‘contract worker’.18

•

–

No minimum length of service is required.

–

Check the worker has a disability under the EqA 2010 s6.19

–

Check the worker’s condition is not specifically excluded.20

Has the employer treated the worker less favourably because of disability? This would be direct
discrimination.21

•

Has the employer treated the worker unfavourably because of something arising in consequence
of the worker’s disability?22
–

Why did the employer dismiss, discipline, fail to promote or treat the worker badly in any
other way?

–

Was that reason because of something arising in consequence of the worker’s disability, eg
because of his/her attendance record which has disability-related absences?

–

If so, can the employer prove the treatment was a proportionate means of achieving a
legitimate aim (taking account of any obligation to make reasonable adjustments)? If not, this
would be discrimination arising from disability (DAFD).

–

Did the employer know the worker had a disability? If not, could s/he reasonably have been
expected to know?

•

Has the employer discriminated by failing to comply with a duty of reasonable adjustment?23
–

Did the employer know or should s/he have known that the worker had a disability and that
an adjustment may be required?

–

Was the worker put at a disadvantage because of the failure to make reasonable
adjustments?

–

Was that disadvantage because of the worker’s disability?

–

Was the disadvantage more than minor or trivial?

–

Consider possible adjustments which may assist the worker.24 (Discuss with the worker, the
worker’s GP and any relevant specialist organisation.)

Is it reasonable to expect the employer to have made the adjustment?
•

Has the worker been subjected to indirect discrimination?25

•

Has the worker been harassed?26

•

Has the worker been victimised, ie, discriminated against for complaining of discrimination under
the EqA 2010?27
–

How and when did the worker complain of discrimination?

–

Did the employer dismiss or treat the worker badly in any other way as a result?

–

Will the employer say the worker’s allegation was false and made in bad faith? (If the
employer can prove that, the worker will lose.)

•

If the worker was a job applicant, did the employer make any enquiries about his/her health,
health record or disability before making a job offer?28 If so, did the employer directly
discriminate against the worker based on information given in his/her answer?

•

Overall, consider what medical and other evidence may be necessary.

•

Can the cost of medical evidence be covered? Can full costs be recovered from the ET?

•

Is the worker willing and able to bring an ET case?

•

What outcome would the worker want?

•

Note time limits for starting an ET case/notifying ACAS under the EC rules.

•

Ensure the worker complies with any relevant part of the ACAS Code on Disciplinary and
Grievance Procedures, eg by bringing a grievance.

•

Consider writing a non-statutory questionnaire.

•

Does the worker have any other legal claims, eg, unfair dismissal?

•

When writing the ET1, if the facts allow, state the case as under EqA 2010 s13 and/or s15
and/or ss20–21.29 This is the most likely combination, though other definitions could apply. Do
not add definitions which could not apply to the facts and evidence, eg think carefully about
whether the facts and evidence could prove direct discrimination (s13), or whether the case is
really only about DAFD (s15) and reasonable adjustments (ss20–21).

A17 DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION – STAGES OF REASONABLE
ADJUSTMENTS
The requirement on employers to make reasonable adjustments is to ensure that disabled
workers are not put at a disadvantage due to their disability. If a disabled worker is
having difficulties at work or not performing well, it is important to show that this is
because of his/her disability rather than an unconnected reason, eg s/he is just not very
good at his/her job. It is necessary to consider what it is about the job duties or workplace
that causes the difficulty. This also requires considering the exact effect of the worker’s
disability. Stages 2 or 3 below are likely to reveal if the disadvantage is unconnected with
disability. The wording of the definition in the EqA 2010 is rather clumsy, but it is
necessary to follow the stages set out below:30
1

Identify the substantial disadvantage suffered by the worker, eg inability to carry out certain
work or to carry it out to a required standard or sitting or standing; having difficulty working
particular hours or under certain circumstances. Where it is specific aspects of the worker’s role
which cause the difficulty, the duties must be identified in sufficient detail to pinpoint the nature
and extent of the disadvantage, eg if completing paperwork is a difficulty, the disadvantage might
be described as ‘inability to complete paperwork legibly by hand’. The disadvantage must be
substantial, ie more than minor or trivial.

2

Identify what it is about the work requirements or workplace or lack of equipment which has
caused the disadvantage, ie the provision criterion or practice applied by or on behalf of the
employer or the physical feature of the premises and/or the lack of an auxiliary aid. For example,
the employer requires work to be done of a certain kind or to a certain standard or in a particular
way, or requires the worker to attend full-time between certain hours. As at stage 1, where the
problematic provision, criterion or practice (PCP) is carrying out certain duties, these need to be
identified in sufficient detail to identify the problem, eg it may not be completing paperwork
which causes a difficulty, but it may be the need to complete it by hand.

3

If appropriate, identify a non-disabled comparator (actual or hypothetical) who is not
disadvantaged by such PCP or physical feature or lack of an aid. This is a rather artificial step
caused by the clumsy wording of the legislation and should not be viewed the same way as
comparators in direct discrimination cases. The idea is simply to show that the reason the worker
is at a disadvantage is due to his/her disability as opposed to other reasons. It usually involves
simply saying that a hypothetical person without the disability and effects of the disability (but
otherwise with the same skills and competence as the worker) would not be disadvantaged by

the particular PCP etc. For example, a non-disabled worker would not usually have difficulty
completing paperwork by hand. It would not be appropriate to compare the position of a disabled
worker who cannot as a result of his/her disability complete paperwork by hand with a nondisabled worker who for other reasons cannot complete paperwork by hand.
4

Make suggestions as to what adjustments would have been reasonable to prevent such a PCP
etc disadvantaging the worker.

Example 1
The worker’s hours are 9 am to 5 pm, but this involves traveling to and from work during
rush hour. This is a problem because the trains are very crowded and the worker has
agoraphobia.
Stage 1: The disadvantage is inability to travel during rush hour.
Stage 2: The disadvantage is caused by the employer’s PCP that the worker work 9 am to 5 pm.
Stage 3: A hypothetical comparator without agoraphobia (or other disability) would not be put at
that kind of disadvantage by being required to travel at rush hour.
Stage 4: Adjusting working hours.

Example 2
The worker has multiple sclerosis, which makes it difficult for her to walk up and down
stairs at the office without handrails. She works on the ground floor, so she does not need
to use the stairs, but the rest of her department is on the 1st floor.
Stage 1: The disadvantage is inability to use the stairs to visit her colleagues.
Stage 2: The disadvantage is caused by a physical feature of the premises, ie lack of handrails on
the stairs.
Stage 3: A comparator who was not disabled would be able to use the stairs.
Stage 4: Putting up handrails or moving the whole department downstairs.

Example 3
The worker has a visual impairment. She finds it difficult to read the computer screen and
as a result makes data entry errors. As a result of her errors, she is demoted.
Stage 1: The disadvantage is difficulty reading the computer screen and therefore difficulty
making accurate data entries.
Stage 2: The disadvantage is caused by the lack of an auxiliary aid (adapted software). The
worker needs to prove that the errors are caused by her visual impairment and that adapted

software would prevent the errors.
NOTE: If her errors have nothing to do with her difficulty seeing the screen and are simply
caused by inability to add up, her reasonable adjustment claim would fail at this stage.
Stage 3: A hypothetical comparator with the worker’s general level of ability but who did not
have a visual impairment (or other disability) would not be making the errors.
NOTE: If the worker’s errors were due to her inability to add up and not due to her visual
impairment, then a non-disabled worker with the same capabilities would have been at the same
disadvantage and the worker’s reasonable adjustment claim would fail.
Stage 4: Adapted software.

A18 DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CLAIM UNDER THE
EQUALITY ACT 2010 – SAMPLE LETTER TO GP
NOTE that this is not a standard letter. The letter would vary according to the facts and
how obvious the worker’s disability and symptoms are. In some cases, it will be
appropriate to write a shorter letter focusing on very specific points of concern.
Dear Dr […]
Re: [Client’s full name, address and date of birth]
I am advising Claudia regarding a potential claim against her employers for disability
discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. In order for me to assess whether Claudia is covered
by the Act, I should be grateful if you would write a Report concerning her condition and
covering the following points.
1

Please could you specify the nature of the impairment from which Claudia suffers.

2

Please could you comment on whether Claudia’s ability to carry out day-to-day activities is
adversely affected to a substantial (as opposed to minor or trivial) degree. It would be very
helpful if you could give concrete examples and address activities such as mobility, ability to lift,
social interaction [make suggestions re relevant activities]. Please note that it is not simply a
question of whether Claudia is able to do such activities at all, but whether she has pain or other
difficulty in carrying them out.

3

If Claudia’s condition is controlled by medication or aids, please could you also state how
Claudia’s abilities under the above categories would be affected were she not taking any
medication.

4

The Act protects workers where the effect of the impairment has lasted at least 12 months or is
likely to last for 12 months or for the rest of their life, if less. Recurring effects are also covered,
ie, if the effect lasts less than 12 months but is likely to recur. Please could you clarify when the
substantial adverse effects started to apply to Claudia and when they ceased or, if they have not
yet ceased, when they are likely to cease. When I say ‘likely’, I simply mean that it could well
happen.

5

Claudia has told me that she has particular difficulties with mobility. Could you please especially
address this point and let me know whether you would expect her:
(i)

to have any difficulty using public transport;

(ii) to be able to travel a short journey in a car;
(iii) to have any difficulty going up or down stairs.

Would the position be any different if she were not taking medication?
6

I attach a brief description of Claudia’s job duties and areas of difficulty caused by her
impairment. Do you have any suggestions as to adjustments to Claudia’s working conditions
which may be of assistance to her?
I enclose Claudia’s written authorisation for you to disclose the above information to me. Please
feel free to telephone should you wish clarification. Please let me know before writing your
report if there will be any fee.
NOTE: Where the adviser is aware of an area of difficulty for the claimant, s/he may wish
to guide the doctor further, eg, by reference to the examples in the appendix to the
Guidance and paras D11–D17. Paragraph 5 of the letter is an example of this.
If the GP’s letter is to be shown to the employer, the worker must think carefully about its
implications. If the letter suggests that the worker cannot do the job at all, but no
adjustments are feasible, this could lead to difficulties.
The fee should be agreed in advance and you should check who will be responsible for its
payment.

A19 ET1: DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CLAIM (VARIOUS)
Sample details of disability discrimination claim for para 8.2 of ET1 form. In this example,
a discriminatory dismissal is pleaded in the alternative under each of EqA 2010 s13 (direct
discrimination), s15 (discrimination arising from disability) and ss20–21 (failure to make
reasonable adjustments).
1

I worked as a messenger for my employers from 17 May 2015 until my dismissal on 12 May
2021. I was dismissed because I reached 20 days’ sickness absence in each of my last three
years of employment under the Sickness Monitoring Procedure. However, nearly all my sickness
absences were due to bronchial asthma.

2

My employers were a large company employing over 1,000 members of staff. There were ten
other messengers who did the same job as I did. If any messenger was absent through sickness,
the others would cover the work on overtime. There was also an agency which supplied workers
at short notice in emergencies.

3

The messengers were based in a small office with poor ventilation. I told my employers several
times that this aggravated my asthma.

4

Apart from my sickness, I have had no warnings throughout my employment. Indeed, I have
often been complimented on my good work.

5

I believe that I was dismissed on because of my disability contrary to the Equality Act 2010 s13.
I believe a non-disabled worker who reached 20 days’ sickness for three successive years would
not have been dismissed.

6

Further or alternatively, I was dismissed because of something arising out of my disability
contrary to Equality Act 2010 s15 in that nearly all my sick absences were due to my disability.

7

Further or alternatively, I have been discriminated against contrary to sections 20–21 of the
Equality Act 2010 by my employers’ failure to make adjustments, for example, by (i) basing me
in an office with better ventilation, and/or (ii) discounting my disability-related absences when
applying the Sickness Monitoring Procedure to me, and/or (iii) any other reasonable adjustment.

A20 SAMPLE WITNESS STATEMENT IN RACIAL AND
RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT CASE
In reality, a claimant’s witness statement may be longer than the following example. A
description of the claimant’s duties should also be added. The following, however, gives an
idea of style and content. Note how the statement draws attention to the differences in the
claimant’s treatment before and after the main discriminator (Ricky Johnson) started and
also compares his treatment in detail with that of a white comparator (Peter Scholar). In
discrimination cases, different treatment is more significant than unfair treatment.
For a sample witness statement in an unfair dismissal case, see appendix C.

SAYED MEGALI: WITNESS STATEMENT
Background
1

I was born in Egypt and I grew up there. I came to England in 1996. I have British nationality. I
am of the Muslim religion. I was employed as a room service waiter in Herberts Hotel for 16
years. I was promoted to supervisor after three years. Then after another three years I became
senior supervisor. While I worked at Herberts Hotel, I never had any disciplinary action taken
against me nor did I take any grievances.

2

In 2012 I left the job to return to Egypt for family reasons. When I came back to England in
2013, I started working as security guard for various agencies. On 15 October 2015, I started
work as security guard for Matts Hotel.

3

I was already well-known in the hotel. I had worked as a casual waiter previously. I got on well
with everyone. The hotel asked about me in the catering department before they took me on in
security.

4

Robert Keen started one week before me as Chief of Security. Before Ricky Johnson started, I
used to get on well with Robert Keen. Ricky Johnson started in July 2019 as Assistant Chief
Security Officer. Ricky Johnson and Robert Keen are both white and English. I believe they are
of the Christian religion.

Ricky Johnson
5

Ricky Johnson was hostile and abusive from the beginning. If there was any news story about
the Middle East or Arabs or if there were Arab guests in the hotel, he used to say, ‘Fucking
Arabs’.

6

Gradually Robert Keen became more and more hostile to me. For example, Robert Keen kept
saying, ‘I am fed up with you. Why don’t you go back to Egypt?’ He never used to talk like that
before.

7

Before Ricky Johnson came, Robert Keen was helpful when I wanted to pray. He even said,
‘Sayed, I will be in the office for a while, you can go and pray.’ He also let me take Fridays as
one of my off-days so I could go to the mosque. After Ricky Johnson came, all this stopped, but
Robert Keen gave Ricky Johnson every Saturday off so he could watch football.

8

One day in August or September 2019, I saw a PG Tips card with a picture of a monkey put up
on the wall where we make tea. Ricky Johnson used to buy the tea. I took it down and threw it
away, but a few weeks later, when a new packet of tea was bought, a new monkey card was
put up. I asked Ricky Johnson if he put it there. He denied it, but I believe it was him. It never
happened before he came.

9

On 30 October 2019, I wrote to the hotel manager (Frank Alexander) taking out a grievance for
race and religious discrimination against Ricky Johnson. Mr Alexander acknowledged my letter
on 2 November 2019 and said that his secretary would contact me to arrange an appointment to
meet.

10

On 14 November 2019, I received a letter from personnel calling me to a disciplinary the next
day. I had worked in security for four years and as a casual waiter for the hotel previously. This
was the first time I had been called to a disciplinary.

11

The letter said that the disciplinary was because Ricky Johnson said I had shouted and sworn at
him. I told personnel at the disciplinary that this was not true. I said that he had made the
accusation because I had taken out the grievance of race and religious discrimination. At the end
of the disciplinary, personnel decided to take no action.

12

I met Mr Alexander on 28 November 2019 to talk about my grievance. The meeting was for
about one hour. Mr Alexander said he would investigate and come back to me, but he never did
come back to me about it afterwards.

The new security guard
13

In January 2020, a new security guard, Peter Scholar, was recruited. Peter was white/English
and of the Christian religion. Peter was very young, about 22 years old. He had not worked in
security for as long as I had. I knew Peter Scholar. He had worked at the hotel for six months in
2019 for an independent security company employed by the hotel’s building contractors. His main
job was to stop the builders using the staff entrance. He had to search the builders when they
went out with a bag. He also patrolled the hotel to keep an eye on the builders.

14

Right from the start, Peter Scholar was treated better than I was in many ways. He was paid
more than I, even though we were supposed to be doing the same job. Then in April 2021, he

was given a rise and I did not get a rise.
15

In the first week Peter Scholar started, Ricky Johnson took him to a hotel management meeting.
All the senior hotel managers go to that meeting every Friday. I have never been taken to it. The
previous day I had heard Ricky tell Peter he would take him to the meeting so that he could
cover if Robert Keen or Ricky Johnson were not there.

16

Before Peter Scholar started, the hotel’s internal telephone directory only listed Robert Keen and
Ricky Johnson by name under Security. After Peter started, his name was put on the list too. I
was still not named. I was just ‘Back Door Security’.

17

When there is an important function in the ballroom, sometimes they need extra security. I was
never given a chance to do this. It was always Robert Keen or Ricky Johnson or outside
security. I was not asked. But in his first or second week, Peter Scholar was allowed to do a
ballroom function.

18

I saw Ricky Johnson show Peter Scholar how to use the computer several times in his first few
weeks. Ricky spent more time with Peter than he spent showing me.

19

In February 2021, the number of the safe in the security office was changed. Peter Scholar was
given the new number, but I was not. I asked Robert Keen why he changed the safe number. He
said it was because there were important papers there. He would not give me the number. This
had never happened before. Later he told Mr Alexander he changed the safe number because of
an electronic fault, but he did not say that to me and he did not give me the new safe number
until Mr Alexander intervened.

20

In April 2021, Peter Scholar received a pay-rise. Most of the other hotel staff also received a
rise – though some did not. Robert Keen and Ricky Johnson also received a rise, so the whole
security department except me got a rise. I had received a rise every April since I started. This
April I did not get a rise.

21

I have continued to be harassed by Ricky Johnson. [Give full dates and details of incidents.]
Robert Keen has also started to criticise my work and threaten me with disciplinary action.
[Give full dates and details of incidents.] Until Ricky Johnson started, Robert Keen had never
made any serious criticisms of my work or threatened disciplinary action.

22

Until all this happened, I was never off sick from work, even for one day. All the pressure and
harassment for so long have damaged my health. On 5 May 2021, my doctor told me I was not
fit for work due to depression. I was off sick for four weeks.

23

I think I have been treated this way because of my Egyptian or Arab origin and also because of
my Muslim religion. I also think that I have been victimised because I complained about the
harassment.

I really did not want to go to the tribunal. I wrote so many letters. I told the hotel I would prefer
to sort it out. But in the end they gave me no option. I have found it very hard to go to work over
the last few years. Every day I wondered if I was going to get a letter accusing me of doing
something wrong or a disciplinary. It is very stressful. In the end, I became very depressed. I
have never been depressed before. I am not that kind of person. I have not taken any further
grievance because I am afraid it will just lead to me getting harassed further as has happened in
the past.

A21 EXTRACTS FROM SAMPLE WITNESS STATEMENT OF
TRADE UNION OFFICIAL IN SUPPORT OF CLAIMANT’S
RACE DISCRIMINATION CASE
As well as establishing the facts and events in which the official was involved, this
statement draws attention to all the ways in which the employer’s behaviour differed from
what normally occurs (with white staff). In discrimination cases, it is more relevant to
highlight different behaviour than unfair behaviour. The statement also establishes the
basis of experience from which the official is able to generalise and draw distinctions.
1

I am Branch Secretary of the [name] trade union, based at [name] Council. I have held that
position for approximately four years. I have been a member of the local trade union committee
since 2001. I have been involved in a multitude of investigations and disciplinaries of council staff
as their trade union representative.

2

The housing department, where the claimant works, comprises 120 members of staff. Although
approximately one-third of the staff are black or from minority ethnic groups, nearly all the
managers are white. The trade union has taken up equal opportunities issues with management
on several occasions. [Describe incidents revealing management in a bad light on equal
opportunities policies, but keep concise and relevant.]

3

I was involved in the events concerning the claimant from the beginning. My first involvement
was on [date] when the claimant was notified of disciplinary action.

4

[Describe sequence of events with dates, official’s role and how much information was
given to the official and/or the claimant by management.]

5

It is very unusual to have a disciplinary hearing without a prior investigation. Normally the
investigation is carried out first and the accused person is told about the investigation and what
the allegations are. The disciplinary then takes place if and when the investigation reveals there
is enough to justify it. It was also extraordinary not even to know the allegations against the
claimant until just before the disciplinary hearing.

6

Another unusual aspect was [Describe all procedural irregularities which took place].

7

[If official has anything useful to say regarding the disciplinary allegations themselves,
insert here.]

A22 ET1: UNFAIR DISMISSAL (CONDUCT) AND WRITTEN
REASONS
Sample details of claim for unfair dismissal and failure to give written reasons for
dismissal for para 8.2 of ET1 form.
1

I started work for the respondent restaurant in May 2019 as a sous chef. I was never given a
written contract.

2

Until 18 July 2021, there were no problems with my employment and I had received no
disciplinary warnings of any kind. I took orders from various more senior members of kitchen
staff, including the 2nd Head Chef, Basil.

3

Basil’s manner in the kitchen was generally to shout and abuse more junior staff. On 18 July
2021, I was joking with some of my colleagues as I worked. Other supervisors would allow us to
talk and joke as long as we got the work done. Basil entered the kitchen and poked his finger in
the chest of some of my colleagues. He also waved his finger at me and he told us all to ‘shut
up’.

4

I was upset by his angry manner and I asked him what was wrong. He swore at me in response
and I therefore swore back at him. He told us to ‘f … ing shut up’ and to ‘f … off’. I replied to
him ‘f … off’. I regret doing this, but it was completely provoked by Basil’s manner towards me
and my colleagues. Also swearing and use of the ‘f …’ word is very common in the kitchen at
all levels of staff.31

5

Basil then shouted at me to go home. When I did not want to do this, he became more angry and
said that I was suspended and to go home and he called security.

6

When I came in on 19 July 2021, I found the head chef, Mo, and tried to explain what had
happened. Mo’s first response was that I had been there for two years and should know what
Basil was like. He said ‘Better look for another job’. Then he told me to return the next day at 5
pm. Then when I went in on 20 July 2021, I was handed a letter calling me to a disciplinary
hearing on 23 July 2021.

7

When I arrived on 23 July 2021, Mo and Basil were sitting there. Mo said, ‘We have decided you
are dismissed. We have discussed it and we have decided.’ I was stunned. I had only just
entered the room. I said, ‘I would just like to explain something.’ Mo said, ‘OK, Carry on.’ I said
that Basil had sworn at me first. Basil said the supervisor had already told me twice to shut up. I
said that had not happened. Basil did not respond. Mo then said, ‘OK, thank you, sorry you have
to go.’ The whole meeting took about two minutes. No questions were asked of me. I did not
even get the chance to sit down.

8

I then went to look for the General Manager, who I found at the bar. I told him I had been
dismissed. He said he would look into the details. However, I have not heard from him since.

9

On 25 July 2021, I wrote to the General Manager and asked him the written reasons for my
dismissal. I have had no response.

10

I believe I was unfairly dismissed contrary to Employment Rights Act 1996 s98 in that:32
(a) Having regard to usual language in the kitchen and in particular the generally abusive
manner of Basil and the fact that he spoke to me initially on 18 July 2021 in an abusive way,
there was not a fair reason to dismiss me.
(b) I had been given no prior warnings regarding my conduct or any other matter.
(c) There was no proper investigation and I was not given a fair hearing prior to my dismissal.
In particular:
(i)

the allegations against me were not clearly put to me;

(ii) I was given no proper chance to state my case;
(iii) I was not listened to with an open mind.
(d) The General Manager did not look into the matter as he promised me and I was deprived of
the opportunity of an appeal.
11

Good practice guidelines in the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance
Procedures were not followed as set out above.

12

I further request a declaration as to the reasons for my dismissal and compensation pursuant to
Employment Rights Act 1996 s92.

A23 ET1: UNFAIR DISMISSAL (CONDUCT), NOTICE AND RIGHT
TO BE ACCOMPANIED
Sample details of claim for unfair dismissal, notice, pay and breach of the right to be
accompanied, for para 8.2 of ET1 form.
1

The claimant was employed as a part-time receptionist by the respondent Leisure Clubs from on
or about 10 April 2011 until termination on 7 July 2021. She never received any warnings
throughout her employment.33

2

At the tennis club where the claimant was based, there were two car parks, one for members of
the club and one for the staff. As a general rule, staff were asked not to park in the members’
car park unless the staff car park was full.

3

In practice, however, staff frequently parked in the members’ car park at different times and on
occasion left their cars there overnight or for prolonged periods of time. Management were
aware of this but took no action.

4

The claimant also used to park her car in the members’ car park on occasion, for example, at
night or when the staff car park was full, and was sometimes reminded in passing that she should
use the staff car park. At no time did the claimant receive a formal verbal or written warning for
parking her car in the members’ car park.34

5

On 26 June 2021 the claimant was driving into the members’ car park in order to pick up a
member. She was accompanied in her car by a friend. On her way in she met John Armitage,
the Finance Director, who was also in his car.

6

John Armitage said something to her, but because both parties were in their cars, the claimant did
not hear him properly. She believed he was saying something about the van owned by the health
club, which was parked nearby, and she replied to him ‘That’s a delivery’. She then parked in the
members’ car park and went into the club to meet the member she was picking up, who was
late.

7

The claimant received a letter dated 4 July 2021 which informed her that a disciplinary interview
had been arranged to deal with ‘continued abuse of the club car park and wilful misconduct
towards a Director of the company’ relating to the incident with John Armitage.

8

The disciplinary hearing took place on 7 July 2021. John Armitage conducted the interview. The
claimant wanted one of her colleagues to accompany her. She was told this was unnecessary.

9

At the meeting, John Armitage explained the reasons why the disciplinary meeting was taking
place and said that he had told the claimant not to park her car in the members’ car park, which
she had then gone on to do. The claimant explained that there had been a misunderstanding

about this incident, because she had not understood what he was saying at the time. If she had
known what he was saying she would not have deliberately disobeyed him.
10

The claimant was summarily dismissed and did not return to work after that date. She did not
appeal this decision because she was very shocked at the time and was not informed of her right
to appeal.

11

The claimant was unfairly dismissed. In particular, the respondent:35
(i)

failed properly to investigate the allegations against the claimant;

(ii) failed to reach a reasonable conclusion;
(iii) failed to have a reasonable belief in the claimant’s guilt;36
(iv) failed to follow its own contractual disciplinary procedures;
(v) failed to inform the claimant of her right to appeal the decision to dismiss;
(vi) failed to follow the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures;37
(vii) allowed John Armitage to act as witness, prosecutor and judge;
(viii) it was not reasonable in all the circumstances for the respondent to dismiss and the
dismissal fell outside the band of reasonable responses.
12

The claimant further claims six weeks’ pay in lieu of notice.

13

The respondent failed to permit the claimant to be accompanied at the disciplinary hearing
contrary to section 10 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 and contrary to the ACAS Code
on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures.38 The claimant claims compensation.

A24 LIST OF ISSUES FOR DISCRIMINATION CASE (WITH
OTHER CLAIMS)
At preliminary hearings to discuss case management, which are usually held in
discrimination cases, it is common for the employment judge to make a list of the ‘issues’
in the case. Essentially, this sets out the claims and their component parts. It is best to go
prepared with a ‘draft’ to hand up to the judge and the other side, to make sure nothing
gets left out. Ideally, send the draft to the other side in advance and try to get agreement to
the content. The following is an example. The words in square brackets are optional.
1

Did the respondent subject the claimant to direct race discrimination [under the Equality Act
2010 sections 9 and 13] by giving her a written warning on 16 April 2021?

2

Did the respondent subject the claimant to direct race discrimination [under the Equality Act
2010 sections 9 and 13] by dismissing her on 23 May 2021?

3

In respect of the claimant’s victimisation claim [under the Equality Act 2010 section 27]:
(a) Did the claimant allege race discrimination when speaking to her manager on 20 April
2021?
(b) If so, was that allegation a ‘protected act’?
(c) Did the respondent victimise the claimant by dismissing her on 23 May 2021 as a result of
that allegation?

4

In respect of the claimant’s unfair dismissal claim:
(a) Can the respondent prove the reason for dismissal and what is that reason?
(b) Was it fair to dismiss the claimant for that reason, taking account of the band of reasonable
responses?
(c) Did the respondent fail to follow a relevant part of the ACAS Code on Disciplinary and
Grievance Procedures and if so, should there be an adjustment of compensation and in what
sum?

5

Did the respondent has made an unauthorised deduction from the claimant’s pay [contrary to
Part II of the Employment Rights Act 1996] in the sum of £450 representing the claimant’s
wages for the period 10–23 May 2021?

6

Compensation if the claimant is successful in any of the above claims.

A25 VARIATION OF CONTRACT CHECKLIST
The law is complicated around what an employee can do if the employer tries to impose a
change of terms and conditions in the contract of employment. In theory, no change can
be made to a contract unless the employee agrees. In practice, what happens if the
employer just sacks an employee who refuses to agree? Not only will the employee have no
job, s/he may not be eligible to make any legal claims. Even if the employee is eligible to
claim, s/he may not win.
It is commonly believed that employers only need to give 90 days’ notice of a change. This
is not in fact true, the employee’s consent is still necessary.
The following is a guide to some important steps when thinking through the employee’s
legal position.
•

Check the worker’s employment status. If s/he is not in fact an employee, s/he will have fewer
options, as s/he will not have unfair dismissal protection. Discrimination law is not restricted to
employees in the sense meant by unfair dismissal law.

•

Check the employee’s contract of employment. Is its meaning clear? Is the employer really
changing the contract or is it a change which the contract allows?
WARNING: Contract terms may be written, verbal or implied. If written, they may be
ambiguous. If unwritten, they may be hard to ascertain or prove.

•

Is the employee eligible to claim unfair dismissal if s/he is sacked or resigns due to a contractual
change? If not, his/her position is very weak.

•

Even if the employee is eligible to make an unfair dismissal claim in such circumstances, is s/he
likely to win it?
–

Did the employer adopt fair procedures in implementing the change? (Advance notice;
consultation; flexibility)

–

Would the ET think it reasonable for the employer to impose the change? (The ET may
conclude that the employer’s needs are more important than the negative impact on
employees. Are there better alternatives? Have other employees agreed to the change? Are
there special circumstances?)

•

Is the employee willing to risk losing his/her job over this?

•

What is the likelihood of winning a case and what compensation is the employee likely to
receive?

•

What is the employee’s chance of getting a new job? Will s/he get a bad reference?

•

Compare the problem of working under the varied contract with any alternative/job prospects.

•

Has the employee been discriminated against in the change, directly or indirectly?
–

Is s/he covered by the discrimination legislation? (Note, s/he need not be an employee in the
sense needed for unfair dismissal claims or to have been employed for any minimum period.)

–

Is there any indirect sex discrimination, eg, introducing flexi-shifts or other changes
interfering with childcare?

–

Is there any indirect race discrimination, eg, introducing duties requiring sophisticated written
English skills?

–

Are the changes imposed on some staff but not on others? Is this direct discrimination? For
example, an employer may make an exception for a white worker unable to work flexi-shifts
for health reasons, but refuse to make an exception for a black worker with equally valid
reasons.

–

Has the employer introduced duties which are hard for a disabled worker to undertake?

WARNING: Although the employee may be able to claim discrimination without resigning
from his/her job, s/he may nevertheless be victimised for doing so. Victimisation and
intimidation of an employee pursuing a discrimination case should be catalogued, as this
too is illegal and may be the ground for a further case.

What can the employee do now?
•

Agree the change (orally or in writing).

•

Pin down the employer on the nature of the change and the reasons for it, either in
correspondence (formal letters; informal emails etc) or through a grievance. The employer’s
reasoning helps the worker assess the strength of any tribunal claim and may give scope for a
negotiated compromise.

•

State disagreement with the change and attempt to negotiate.
WARNING: Once negotiation has clearly become futile, the grievance procedure is
exhausted, and the employer is still insisting on the change, an employee needs to make up
his/her mind swiftly whether or not s/he accepts the change. Otherwise s/he can lose the
right to resign because s/he has ‘affirmed’ (ie, implicitly agreed by inaction).

•

Refuse to accept the change. If it amounts to a pay deduction, make a tribunal claim for an
unauthorised deduction or, less practically, a civil claim for the pay owed. If it is a change in
duties, refuse to carry out the change.
WARNING: These steps risk dismissal. Dismissal for claiming an unauthorised deduction is
automatically unfair, but it may be hard to prove that was the reason.

•

Resign and claim unfair constructive dismissal. There are many legal pitfalls for this:

–

The employee may not be eligible to claim unfair dismissal.

–

The contract may be unclear; it may be uncertain that the employer has broken it in a
fundamental way.

–

The employee may not have resigned quickly enough; if s/he has taken too long to decide, the
ET may consider s/he has already accepted the change.

•

–

The employer’s behaviour may not necessarily be considered unfair by the ET.

–

The employee is out of a job and may not get much compensation even if s/he wins.

Make a discrimination claim if applicable. This can be done whether or not s/he resigns, but it
does risk victimisation or dismissal.

•

The employee may also be entitled to a redundancy payment if s/he loses her job in
circumstances which fit the legal definition of redundancy.

•

If the employer imposes the change by dismissing the employee with correct notice and then
offering a new contract on different terms, the employee may be able to accept the new contract
while claiming unfair dismissal in respect of the old contract.

•

If the employer imposes a very radical change, the law may deem this as a dismissal and again
the employee can claim unfair dismissal while remaining in the new job.
WARNING: The employee cannot have it both ways. If s/he accepts the new terms so that
s/he can remain in the job, and reserves his/her right to make a claim in respect of the
variation/dismissal from the original contract, s/he cannot then renege on the new terms.
Otherwise s/he can justifiably be dismissed from the new contract.

•

It will be more effective if a large number of employees simultaneously bring legal action.
Collective opposition and negotiation will usually be the best bet.

A26 WHISTLEBLOWING CHECKLIST
If a worker wants to ‘blow the whistle’ or take up potentially controversial issues at work,
it is very important to take account of the criteria in the Employment Rights Act 1996, so
that s/he has protection if s/he is dismissed or penalised by the employer as a result. The
following checklist does not cover all situations. See also the text at paras 6.101–6.124.
1

Check that the worker reasonably believes that the information which s/he proposes to disclose
tends to show one of the following has taken or may take place:
•

a criminal offence. Identify the relevant offence;

•

breach of a legal obligation, including an obligation in the worker’s own contract of
employment. Identify the relevant obligation;

•

miscarriage of justice;

•

danger to health and safety;

•

damage to the environment.

•

information tending to show any matter falling within these categories has been or is likely to
be deliberately concealed.

2

Check that the worker believed making the disclosure was in the public interest. If so, was that
belief reasonable? (This applies to disclosures made on or after 25 June 2013.)

3

Check that the worker is acting in good faith. (For disclosures on or after 25 June 2013, this will
affect compensation. Before that, it will affect whether s/he is protected at all.)

4

Consider what outcome the worker wants.
•

Is s/he willing to accept potential adverse consequences?

•

Unless the complaint is about how s/he has been treated him/herself, does s/he realise s/he
will only be a witness in any investigation carried out by the employer?

•

Does s/he realise the employer may choose to do nothing about the disclosed information?
This may well be very frustrating, but it is unlikely to amount to unlawful treatment of the
worker because s/he blew the whistle.

5

Check whether the employer has a policy which states to whom disclosure should be made and
what procedure to follow. If not, see 6–8.

6

The worker should initially raise the matter with his/her employer, but exceptionally s/he can
make disclosure to someone else if:
•

in all the circumstances it is reasonable to make disclosure to someone else (taking account
of their identity);

•

the worker reasonably believes the information/allegations are substantially true;

•

disclosure is not made for personal gain;

•

the worker reasonably believes s/he will be subjected to a detriment by the employer if s/he
makes a disclosure to the employer or a prescribed person;

•

there is no prescribed person and the worker reasonably believes it is likely that evidence will
be concealed or destroyed if s/he makes disclosure to employer; or

•
7

it is an exceptionally serious failure.

Alternatively the worker can raise the matter initially with a prescribed body if one exists,
provided the worker reasonably believes the information/allegations are substantially true.

8

If the matter is not resolved internally or by the prescribed body, the worker can raise the matter
with someone else, provided the conditions at 6 above are met.

9

Consider taking advice from ‘Protect’.

A27 ASSESSMENT OF COMPENSATION
Unfair dismissal: compensation checklist
NOTE: This checklist refers to the most common elements comprising unfair dismissal
compensation, but does not refer to all the variables. It is important to read chapter 18.
The checklist is for the private use of the adviser and employee and is not for disclosure to
the employer or ET. For that, see schedules of loss at A30 below.

1 Basic award
(a) Calculate according to age, whole years’ service, gross weekly pay subject to current
weekly maximum.
(b) Check if dismissal was for a reason where a minimum basic award must be made.39
(c) Make any deductions for:40
(i)

unreasonable refusal of an offer of reinstatement;

(ii) misconduct before dismissal;
(iii) redundancy payments made.

2 Compensatory award
Case-law on the order of adding and deducting items is extremely complex and not all
variables have been tested. The following order is a rough guide, but may not be correct in
every case.41
(a) Calculate how much the worker would have earned net of tax had s/he not been dismissed.
Take into account any likely pay rises or overtime. Calculate the loss up to the hearing date
and for a reasonable period into the future. Once the worker has obtained a new job at the
same or greater pay, stop counting the loss.
(b) Add any other losses, eg, pension, health insurance, company car, free meals or
accommodation.
(c) Add expenses incurred as a direct result of the dismissal, eg, the cost of job-hunting.
(d) Add compensation for loss of statutory rights.42
(e) Add compensation for loss of statutory right to a long notice period.
(f)

If the worker obtained a new job on lower pay, deduct the new net earnings.

(g) Deduct any payments made by the former employer as a result of the dismissal, eg, notice
pay or severance payments except, if a redundancy payment is made, the amount by which

it exceeds the basic award.
NOTE: Sometimes notice pay exceeds what is actually due under the contract or statute.
The extra will probably be set off against the balance of the compensatory award unless
the employer explicitly made the payment in respect of the notice period.
(h) Make any percentage deduction under the Polkey principle.43
(i)

Increase or decrease by up to 25 per cent for employer’s or employee’s failure to comply
with the ACAS Code.44

(j)

Add two or four weeks’ pay if, when proceedings began, employer was in breach of duty to
supply section 1 statement of particulars of employment or a section 4 statement of a
change in those particulars.45

(k) Make any percentage deduction for contributory fault.
(l)

Deduct any sum by which a redundancy payment exceeds the basic award.

(m) Apply the overall ceiling on the compensatory award (except where it does not apply).
Remember that although the employer may have to pay the total award, recoupment may
well apply and leave the employee with a lesser sum.46

3 Additional award
If applicable, see para 18.15.

4 Other legal rights
Extra compensation may be paid for other rights claimed at the same time in the tribunal, eg,
discrimination (see below) or failure to give written reasons for dismissal under ERA 1996 s92
(two weeks’ pay). Also claim notice. The employee will not get paid for the notice period twice,
but s/he may not win his/her unfair dismissal case.

Unfair dismissal compensation: example 1 (ACAS Code
correctly followed)
Facts
Roger was dismissed aged 46 on 3 March 2021. He was required to work his notice. Roger had
worked 6½ years for his employer. His gross weekly pay was £485. His net weekly pay was
£390. He had no pension. Roger found a new job after eight weeks, though initially it only paid
£350 net/week. It cost him £50 to look for a job (fares, telephone calls, newspapers). 12 weeks
later he was promoted, getting a rise to £410 net/week. At no stage did Roger claim social
security benefits.

Roger’s case is due to be heard by the tribunal on 8 September 2021, which is exactly 26 weeks
from his dismissal date. Considering the facts of his dismissal, he is likely to have a 20 per cent
deduction for contributory fault and his conduct prior to dismissal. There may also be a 25 per
cent Polkey deduction to represent the fact that had proper procedures been followed prior to
his dismissal, there is a 25 per cent chance that he would nevertheless have been dismissed on a
fair basis.

Calculation of award
Basic award
£485 (below the maximum gross weekly pay for dismissal in the year starting 6 April 2020) x 7½
= £3,637.50 less
20% deduction for conduct prior to dismissal = £2,910
Basic award = £2,910

Compensatory award
Average net earnings which Roger would have received had he not been dismissed = £390/week
(4.3.21 – 28.4.21)47 8 weeks’ loss of net earnings while out of work (8 ′ £390) = £3,120
(29.3.21 – 21.7.21) 12 weeks’ loss of net earnings while working new job on lesser pay (12 ′
(£390–£350)) = £480
expenses looking for a job = £50
loss of statutory rights = £450
Total loss = £4,100

Deductions
25% Polkey (75% x £4,100) = £3,075
20% contributory fault (80% x £3,075) = £2,460
Compensatory award = £2,460
Total for unfair dismissal = £2,910 + £2,460 = £5, 370

Unfair dismissal compensation: example 2 (serious and
flagrant breach of ACAS Code by employer)
Facts
Irina was dismissed on 29 April 2021 aged 36 and required to work her notice. She had worked
with her employer for two years and four months. She was paid £600 per week gross (£460 per
week net). After ten weeks, she obtained a new job at the same level of pay. She had no job-

hunting expenses and did not claim benefits. The tribunal awards 20% uplift for a very serious
breach of the ACAS Code.

Calculation of award
Basic award
£544 (maximum gross weekly pay for dismissal in the year starting 6 April 2021) x 2 = £1,088

Compensatory award
Average net earnings Irina would have received had she not been dismissed = £460/week
10 weeks’48 loss of net earnings while out of work (10 ′ 460) = £4,600
loss of statutory rights = £500
sub-total = £5,100
20% uplift for employer’s failure to comply with ACAS Code = £1,020
Total compensatory award = £6,120
Total for unfair dismissal = £7,208 (£1,088 BA + £6,120 CA).

A28 ASSESSMENT OF COMPENSATION FOR DISCRIMINATION
UNDER THE EQUALITY ACT 2010 (NOT APPLICABLE TO
EQUAL PAY CLAIMS)
Compensation checklist
1

A single compensatory award with no upper ceiling applies.

2

Financial loss resulting from the discrimination, eg, loss of earnings on dismissal or lack of
promotion, loss of pension. (Similar principles to unfair dismissal but may be longer-term future
loss of earnings if severity of discrimination has damaged worker’s confidence or health.)

3

Compensation for injury to feelings including aggravated damages and compensation for damage
to health (personal injury). In rare situations, exemplary damages. Consider these as four
separate headings, though the fairness of the total award must be considered and there must not
be double-counting.

4

Interest.

5

The award should be grossed up in respect of any element which will be taxed. (This can be
complex.)

6

Note that an ET can make recommendations and award extra compensation for failure to
comply with them.

A29 SETTLEMENT TERMS CHECKLIST
Negotiating settlements has become increasingly complicated as employers produce more
and more detailed and onerous written agreements. These are considerations to bear in
mind:
•

Generally consider the tax position, especially with large settlements.49

•

Specify the sum to be paid and that it is free of tax. Do not agree to indemnify the employer for
any attendant costs or for any tax s/he may incur as a result of making that payment. If the
employer insists, narrow down the scope of the indemnity as far as possible.50

•

Ensure there is a date for payment and supply of any reference. This should be either a specified
date or ‘within 14 days of receipt by the employer or if represented, the employer’s
representative of the COT3/settlement agreement signed by the claimant or his/her
representative’. (Ideally get the claimant to sign the COT3 or agreement so there is no dispute
later.)

•

Specify who the settlement cheque should be made payable to and where it should be sent.

•

Attach the agreed wording of the reference. Specify who should supply the reference, that it
should be dated and on headed notepaper. Specify whether any other written or verbal reference
may be given in any circumstances. Consider whether the worker also wants an open
reference.51

•

If the settlement is expressed to be ‘full and final of all claims …’ ensure it is only ‘all claims
arising out of the employment or the termination thereof’.

•

If the proposed wording suggests ‘all claims which the worker has or may have …’, try to delete
the words ‘or may have’. Delete words like ‘whatsoever’.

•

Add ‘with the exception of any personal or industrial injuries52 or pension rights’.

•

If the employer suggests a confidentiality clause, check what is made confidential (the settlement
terms? the fact of the agreement? the case itself? the whole employment?). Make any
necessary exceptions (close relatives; as required by law; prospective employers; bodies such as
the Equality and Human Rights Commission).53

•

Consider whether to ask the employer to retain confidentiality in return.

•

Be careful about vague agreements not to make any ‘derogatory remarks’ or ‘adverse
comments’ about the employer’s business. This wording is so wide that it could, for example,
prevent casual and minor critical remarks made socially about a retail employer’s products. It is

especially problematic if the agreement is not to say anything derogatory about unknown
associated companies or individuals (employees, directors, shareholders).
•

Do not agree to any penalty clause or suggestion that the worker repay the settlement sum if
s/he breaks confidentiality. Apart from anything else, this could make the payment taxable.
Penalty clauses may or may not be enforceable, depending on the overall wording of the
agreement, but it is unwise to take the risk.54

•

If the employer adds clauses in restraint of trade (‘restrictive covenants’), ensure the worker
understands their meaning and effectiveness. These could also make the settlement partially
taxable if some of the payment appears to be for agreeing to such covenants.

•

If the worker owes any money to the employer or there is any suggestion the employer may
wish to sue him or her, ensure that the settlement is full and final of any claims either side may
have.

•

The worker must not agree to do anything which is outside his/her control, eg ensuring that other
people keep matters confidential.

•

The worker should not agree to anything where its meaning or consequences are uncertain.

A30 SCHEDULES OF LOSS
As explained at para 20.182, these can be supplied in various forms. The following are
just alternative models. The starting point is obviously the actual sums which the worker
could claim (see compensation checklist at A27). The claimant would not normally put
down any deductions s/he anticipates for Polkey, contributory fault or failure to mitigate.
None of the following models contain the complex figures necessary to calculate pension
loss.

Model 1: Simple unfair dismissal schedule where claimant
has new job at more pay
This is based on the Roger case study (at A27). Note that other claimants may have other
losses, eg, loss of pension or loss of a long notice period.
Date of birth: 16 February 1975
Effective date of termination: 3 March 2021
Actual gross weekly pay when employed by respondent = £485
Average net weekly pay when employed by respondent = £390
New job from 27 April 2021 (ie 8 weeks from EDT) @ £350 net/week, rising to £410 net/week
after 12 weeks
Hearing date = 8 September 2021 (26 weeks from dismissal)

Basic award
£485 × 7½ = £3,637

Compensatory award
8 weeks’55 loss of net earnings while out of work (8 ′ £390) = £3,120
12 weeks’ loss of net earnings on new job at lesser pay (12 × (£390–£350)) = £480
Expenses looking for a job = £50
Loss of statutory rights = £450
Total compensatory award = £4,100

Model 2: Simple unfair dismissal schedule where claimant
does not have new job
Suppose Roger did not have a new job by the time of the hearing

Basic award
£485 ′ 7½ = £3,637

Compensatory award
Past loss of earnings
From day after dismissal (4.3.21) to hearing date (8.9.21)56 inclusive = 26 weeks @ £390
net/week = £10,140
Future loss of earnings
Ongoing loss at £390/week for as long as the ET thinks appropriate (alternatively, Roger could
speculate, eg, 18 weeks @ £390/week = £7,020)
Expenses looking for a new job = £50
Loss of statutory rights = £450

Model 3: Race discrimination and unfair dismissal model
for use at hearing
The following example is more complicated, as is usual in a discrimination case. The act of
discrimination was the dismissal, which was also unfair. It is possible, rather than inserting
figures for injury to feelings and injury to health (personal injury), to note ‘to be assessed
by the ET’. Increasingly, however, ETs are asking how much the claimant is seeking. It may
also be good tactics to suggest a high (but not unrealistic) figure in the Schedule.
Suggesting unrealistic excessive figures, on the other hand, could be counter-productive.
In this example, the discrimination has had a very severe impact on the worker’s health.
See para 19.40 regarding latest interest rates. Note that an easy way to calculate the
number of weeks or days between two dates is by using the www.timeanddate.com website
or using a formula on Excel. The worker in question did not have a pension.

32 Only set out reasons in this way if confident, since there is the danger of missing something out. If
uncertain, and the unfairness is apparent from the facts set out in the grounds – as in this case – it
may be sufficient to state, ‘for the above reasons, I believe my dismissal was unfair’. The
advantage of itemising the unfairness, if you can, is that it may encourage the employer to settle.
It may also prevent the tribunal writing to the claimant on an ‘initial consideration’ on the basis
that the claim seems to have no reasonable prospect of success (see para 20.100).
33 Claimants ‘forget’ about warnings. Make sure she is correct about this statement.

B2

SEX DISCRIMINATION
Many of the criteria set out above would also adversely affect women. Additional criteria
and practices which would specifically affect women could be:

Attendance/shifts/flexibility/mobility

•

requirements and practices likely to cause difficulty for women – and sometimes for married
men – usually due to childcare commitments

Hours
•

full-time work (refusal to allow jobshare or part-time working)

•

permitting part-time working, but requiring some hours to be worked each day

•

overtime or weekend working

•

shift-working, especially rotating shifts varying from day to day or week to week

•

requirements to work overtime or varying shifts imposed at very short notice

specified and inflexible start or finish times (interfering with times of taking or collecting children
from school or child-minding)

•

all year round working (eg, as opposed to term-time only)

•

requirements entailing certain (high) attendance levels/limited absences

Mobility
•

long journeys to and from work locations (necessitating earlier departures from and returns to
home)

•

work trips necessitating staying overnight away from home

•

relocation (may be unacceptable if woman is not the primary earner in the household)
NOTE: Flexibility and mobility requirements often do cause women difficulties and should
therefore be justified by the employer. However, it would be direct discrimination if an employer
wrongly assumed a woman would be less flexible and treated her less favourably for that reason.

Miscellaneous
•

age bars (women may be out of the job market during child-bearing age)

•

to have acquired a certain level of experience by a certain age

•

certain forms of dress or uniform (eg, may indirectly discriminate against Muslim women)

•

late finishing hours (possibly dangerous travel home)

•

home visits, eg, to patients or tenants unaccompanied (in some circumstances may be dangerous)
NOTE: Employers should provide a safe system of work for all workers, but should not directly
discriminate against women unless allowed by statute (eg, in relation to pregnancy and
childbirth).

B3

RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION

There will be some overlap with indirect race discrimination.

Dress
•

no jewellery

•

no head coverings

uniform which may be regarded as immodest

Alcohol and food
•

canteen without suitable food options

qualifications only recently in existence

•

formal qualifications

•

high level IT skills

•

having no history of unemployment

•

mobility

WITNESS STATEMENT
When writing a witness statement, bear in mind the relevant law. What makes a redundancy
dismissal unfair are failure to consult, unfair selection and failure to offer alternative
employment. Any facts which indicate such failings in the employee’s case should be
highlighted. For guidance on writing witness statements, see para 20.186 onwards.
WITNESS STATEMENT: JENNY PENNANT

Background
1

I started work for Strass Burger House in 2000. I gained my catering qualifications from Huyton
Catering College. After I completed College in 1994, I worked in a number of hotels and
restaurants as a sous chef. By January 2000 I was working as the head chef of the exclusive
Kyverdale restaurant.2

2

On 14 December 2000 I received a letter from Arthur Venger of the Strass Burger House
offering me a job as head chef at the Felstead restaurant. This was the company’s smallest
restaurant. Over the next 12 years I worked at several of the company’s other restaurants. Each
move was a promotion to more prestigious premises, with an increase in pay. My last move was
on 19 December 2012 when I was made the head chef of the Ashburton restaurant, the most
prestigious and best restaurant in the group.

3

Strass Burger House has 150 restaurants throughout the UK. A substantial number of them are
situated in London. The company also has a large head office at 153 Avenal Avenue, London.
There is a large personnel department. Arthur Venger is Head of Human Resources.

4

I never had any time off work for sickness during the 21 years of my employment. I never had
any disciplinary action taken against me or any warnings about my work. At my last annual
appraisal, Mr Venger told me he wished all the workers had the same commitment to the
company that I had.

My company car
5

In November 2020, at the time of the annual appraisal and pay increase, I was told that I would
get a salary of £35,000 per year as well as a company car. I had been asking for a company car
for some time as I often worked late and had no alternative but to catch a taxi home on those
occasions. I was told that it would take about a month to get the car.

6

On 20 March 2021 I had an audit meeting. At this meeting I asked Mr Venger about my
company car. He told me to ‘stop going on about it’ as I was becoming ‘too expensive for the

company’. However, I did ask him again for the car a few times because it had been promised to
me.

My dismissal
7

On 28 April 2021 I was given a letter asking me to attend a meeting at 10 am on 30 April 2021,
regarding my possible redundancy. At the meeting Mr Venger told me that I was being dismissed
on the ground of redundancy because of the economic climate. I was devastated. I had had no
idea before getting the letter that the company was thinking of making redundancies or that I
might be losing my job.3

8

The meeting lasted about five minutes. Mr Venger seemed to be in a hurry. He had obviously
made up his mind from the outset and he gave me no opportunity to argue against my
redundancy. I tried to enter into a discussion about my dismissal, seeking an explanation for this
decision. Mr Venger kept saying that I had been made redundant and that I should not take it
personally. I asked whether there were any other jobs for me in the company but Mr Venger said
that there was nothing suitable. By the end of the meeting I was very upset.

9

I went home after the meeting. That afternoon I received a letter by courier, confirming that I
was being made redundant and enclosing my P45 form and my final payslip. I was told that I
was not required to work out my notice and that I would be paid 12 weeks’ pay in lieu of notice,
statutory redundancy pay and £2,000 as an ex gratia payment.

10

On 1 May 2021, I wrote a letter of appeal to Ms Diana Deane, the managing director. She heard
my appeal on 16 May 2021, but she confirmed the decision. She did say that she would give me
a very good reference. I asked about my holiday pay. The holiday year starts 1 April and I had
not yet taken any holidays this year. I am entitled to four weeks’ holiday every year plus bank
holidays. Ms Deane said that I would not get pay for my untaken holidays because this was at
the discretion of management and I had been paid £2,000 ex gratia.

11

I am not aware of anyone else in the company being made redundant at that time. I do not know
why I was made redundant rather than anyone else. I believe I had longer service than any other
chef.4

After my dismissal
12

I was so shocked by my dismissal that I went to see my GP that same evening. It was the first
time that I had seen my GP for nearly ten years. She prescribed me tablets to take for my
nerves and for shock. It was the first time that I had been dismissed in all my working life.

13

About two weeks after my appeal, I saw Mr Venger’s personal assistant, Patricia Reiss, in
Berwick Street market. She told me that my dismissal had not been a complete surprise to her as

she remembered writing to the finance company cancelling the application for my company car.
She thought this was in January.5

Trying to find new work6
14

Since my dismissal I have been trying without success to secure other employment. In May
2021, I saw a full-page advert in the Hotel and Catering magazine for five different jobs at the
Strass Burger House. I could have done any of these jobs but none of them were mentioned to
me at the time of dismissal. I have also signed-on at a number of specialist agencies. I have been
for a few interviews [give details], but I think my age is against me.7

London E8 7ZY
30 April 2021
Dear Jenny,
Further to our meeting today, I very much regret that I have to confirm that your position as head
chef is now redundant.
You have been given 12 weeks’ pay in lieu of your notice entitlement and in the circumstances
you are not required to attend work during this period.
I will endeavour to find you suitable alternative employment within the company. Should any
position or vacancy arise we will notify you.
May I take this opportunity to thank you for the considerable service you have given to this
company. If you wish to appeal, you may write to the managing director within 14 days.
Yours faithfully
Arthur Venger
Head of Human Resources

INITIAL LETTER TO THE EMPLOYER
The content and style of the initial letter depends on the circumstances. It is common to ask
for written reasons for dismissal, where these have not already been clearly set out (see
para 20.10). Any sums owing, eg, holiday pay or notice pay, should also be requested. The
following letter also asks for the employee’s contract and disciplinary procedure because
the employee has not retained copies of these. In some circumstances, it may be better for
the initial letter to come from the employee him/herself and to be written in informal terms
without referring to any legislation.

Dear Sir,
Re: Jenny Pennant
I act on behalf of the above named in respect of all matters pertaining to her employment at the
Strass Burger House Ltd, and the termination thereof.
In order that I can advise my client further in respect of her several claims against the company,
please supply the following:

1

My client’s main terms and conditions of employment or her contract of employment. In
particular will you supply me with the following particulars:
(a) My client’s contractual right to holiday pay, with sufficient particulars to calculate her
entitlement to accrued holiday pay on the termination of her employment. Your attention is
drawn to section 1(4)(d) of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
(b) My client’s disciplinary and grievance procedure.

2

Details of the company’s redundancy procedure including the selection criteria.

3

The written reasons for my client’s dismissal. As you are no doubt aware, if the reasons given in
purported compliance of this request are inadequate or untrue, the company will have failed to
discharge its legal obligation. Your attention is drawn to section 92 of the Employment Rights Act
1996.8

4

All monies which are owed to my client including her holiday pay.

5

My client’s P45.
My client will be seeking an order for reinstatement or re-engagement as her primary remedy
before the employment tribunal. To this end please supply me with all vacancies within the
company, the terms and conditions attributable to each job and the salary, so that my client can
consider applying for the vacancy.9 Meanwhile, I would invite you to reinstate my client to any
suitable vacancy which you identify.
Please supply the above information within the next 14 days.
Yours faithfully

The claimant submitted her ET1 on 27 July 2021. The form (see below and following pages) is
compulsory. For comments on drafting an ET claim and accessing the standard form, see para
20.60 onwards.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND SERVICE OF ET1 FORM AND
CASE MANAGEMENT TIMETABLE
This is the type of letter which may be sent out in an ordinary unfair dismissal case in
England and Wales at the time of sending the ET1 to the respondent or soon after. Note
that this particular example has several functions – it acknowledges receipt of the ET1; it
serves it on the respondent; it gives a hearing date and sets out a timetable for case
preparation. In a discrimination claim, it is more likely that a letter will be sent out inviting
the parties to a preliminary hearing for case management, at which the hearing date and
timetable for case preparation will be discussed orally.

NOTICE OF CLAIM
NOTICE OF HEARING on 14 January 2022
The claim
The Employment Tribunal has accepted a claim against the above respondent. It has been given
the above case number which should be quoted in any communication relating to this case. A
copy of the claim is enclosed for the respondent.

Responding to the claim
To submit a response to the claim a prescribed form, a copy of which is enclosed, must be used.
Alternatively a respondent may respond online at [link]
If a respondent wishes to defend the claim their response must be received at the tribunal office
by 2 September 2021. If a response is not received by that date and no extension of time has
been applied for and given, or if a respondent indicates that it does not contest any part of the
claim, a judgment may be issued and that respondent will only be entitled to participate in any
hearing to the extent permitted by the employment judge who hears the case.

The hearing

The claim will be heard by an employment judge sitting alone at tribunal address on 14 January
2022 at 10am or as soon thereafter on that day as the tribunal can hear it. The tribunal may
transfer your case at short notice to be heard at another hearing centre within the region. One
day has been allocated to hear the evidence and decide the claim. If you think that is not long
enough, you must give your reasons, in writing, and your time estimate. Unless there are
exceptional circumstances, requests for a postponement or an extension to the hearing length will
not be considered before the return date for the response form.
If you wish to rely on written representations at the hearing, they must be sent to the tribunal and
to all other parties not less than seven days before the hearing. You will have the chance to put
forward oral arguments in any case. It is your responsibility to ensure that any relevant witnesses
attend the hearing and that you bring sufficient copies of any relevant documents.

15 October 2021
Dear Madam/Sir,
Re: Jenny Pennant v Strass Burger House Ltd – Case No: 20085/21
On 29 September 2021 I requested from the respondent’s solicitors additional information of the
response, written answers to questions and disclosure of certain documents. Notwithstanding the
time limit given, these have not been supplied. A copy of the request is attached. Although
disclosure was due on 15 September 2021 under the ordered case management timetable, the
respondent only provided my client’s dismissal letter. Please will you make an order for those
matters sought in my letter of 29 September 2021. It is essential for my client’s case to have this
information, to establish that she has been unfairly dismissed.
An order for the requested information and disclosure will assist the tribunal in dealing with the
proceedings efficiently and fairly for these reasons:
Item 1: This is relevant to the date when consultation with the claimant should have commenced.
Items 2 and 5: These will indicate whether any redundancy selection criteria were applied.
Items 3 and 4: Alternative employment is relevant to the fairness of a redundancy dismissal.
Item 6: This is relevant as to the timing and reasoning behind the dismissal.
Items 8 and 9: These are standard items.
I have copied this letter to the respondents today and informed them that any objection to my
application for an order should be sent to the tribunal as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully,

Hill, Wood & Co
GILLESPIE HOUSE, 13 HIGHBURY STREET, LONDON NW2 1PC
D Rocastle
The London Employment Project
12 Malvern Road, London E8 3LT
15 December 2021
Dear Sir,
Re: Jenny Pennant v Strass Burger House Ltd – Case No: 20085/21
You should by now have copies of the documents you requested. In reply to the employment
tribunal order of 2 December 2021 to supply additional information and written answers to the
claimant’s letter of 29 September 2021:
1

The decision was made at a meeting on 10 February 2021 attended by Arthur Venger and Diana
Deane. It was a decision reached as part of a reorganisation of the company which was felt to
be in the best future interest of all concerned.

2

No other person was dismissed.

3

After 30 April 2021, Arthur Venger personally dealt with this matter. He decided to offer the
claimant any future vacancy at head chef level in the larger restaurant. There was no point
offering her any other position as she would not have accepted such an offer.

4

The respondent is a large organisation and the turnover of staff in the industry is high. There
were many vacancies for other positions within the company, but they were not suitable. The
respondent did not take these positions into consideration as they were not relevant.
Yours faithfully,
Dan Fishman

C13 TERMS OF SETTLEMENT 24
The respondent undertakes:
1

to pay the claimant on or before 2 February 2021 the sum of £15,500 in full and final settlement
of all claims that she has arising out of her employment and the termination thereof, save for any
claim for personal injury or industrial injury,25

2

to supply the following reference and only this reference, if requested for the same, and not to
depart from it unless with the express permission of the claimant. If the reference is requested in
writing, to supply the same on headed notepaper, dated and duly signed.26
‘Jenny Pennant has been employed by Strass Burger House Ltd from 2000 until her dismissal on
the ground of redundancy on 30 April 2021. She was promoted on several occasions and at the
time of her dismissal was employed as the senior head chef. Throughout her employment we
found her to be honest, hardworking and enthusiastic. Her timekeeping and attendance were
exemplary. She had a pleasant personality and was liked by the other members of staff, as well
as by management. We have no hesitation in recommending her for future employment in a
similar capacity.’27

3

The above reference will also be supplied to the claimant as an open reference on or before 2
February 2022 on headed paper, dated and duly signed, and headed ‘To whom it may concern’.

4

The claimant undertakes to withdraw her employment tribunal claim on receipt of the above sum
and open reference, and in the meanwhile the case is adjourned generally.28

1 Note that this case study is purely fictional.
2 When writing a statement for the purpose of an unfair dismissal claim it is important to establish
the previous work record (if it is good) and qualifications that the worker has acquired. If the
person has worked for a long time for one employer this should be emphasised, particularly in
cases of conduct/capability dismissals. Workers should set it out if they are well qualified, have
had considerable experience in the industry, have worked for well-known employers, and held
important positions in the past. However, give the information concisely.
3 It is worth emphasising lack of forewarning and consultation, as these may help make the
dismissal unfair.
4 Unfair selection can make a redundancy dismissal unfair. An employer need not use length of
service as a selection criterion, but in some circumstances it may be a factor which the ET would
expect to be taken into account (unless discriminatory).
5 It is a matter of judgement whether to quote what someone else has said if unsure whether they
will be a helpful witness for the claimant.
6 Especially in unfair dismissal cases, ETs expect claimants to be ready to deal with the issue of
compensation if they win.
7 It is important that the worker can demonstrate that s/he has attempted to mitigate his/her losses.
Prior to the hearing it will be necessary to obtain letters from specialist job agencies or the job
centre, stating when the worker first signed on, what type of jobs s/he was prepared to do, what
vacancies are available in the industry, and whether any jobs were offered. The worker should
also keep details of online applications and notifications.
8 Even if the employer has supplied the written reasons the adviser is entitled to ask for them
pursuant to Employment Rights Act (ERA) 1996 s92 and it will be these reasons which the
tribunal will consider. If they are different to the previous statement, both can be referred to.
9 If the worker wants the job back, it is important that this is made known to the employer at the
earliest opportunity. It will also assist in obtaining an additional award from the tribunal (see para
18.15 above) if the employer was put on notice at an early stage.
10 State a time limit with which to comply; 14 days is fairly standard.
11 It is important to try to ascertain the precise date when the decision was reached to dismiss the
employee. From this date the employer would be expected to consult with the employee and
consider alternative employment.
12 This information is necessary to ascertain whether the worker was the only person dismissed and,
if not, the other types of workers who were dismissed.
13 The failure to find alternative employment can make the dismissal unfair. The tribunal will have to
consider the efforts made, in relation to the size and administrative resources of the employer’s

undertaking. This comparison cannot be made without this information.
14 The period chosen starts on the date the employer says s/he first contemplated redundancy and
ends on the date the employee’s notice would have expired, had she been allowed to work it. On
receiving the information, consider all the vacancies and list those which the employee could have
been offered (ie, within his/her capability). If none of these jobs was offered it will be necessary
to ascertain at the hearing the reason why not.
15 Needed to ascertain whether the selection of the worker was unfair. In some circumstances,
length of service may be a relevant criterion, provided that it is not indirectly discriminatory in that
workplace.
16 Needed for the purpose of determining the question of alternative employment.
17 Needed to ascertain when the decision to dismiss was made, who made it and how it was
proposed to deal with those workers being dismissed.
18 This is a standard request to ensure the respondent holds nothing useful back of which the
employee is unaware and also that the employee is not surprised by any problematic documents
which the respondent first produces at the hearing.
19 This paragraph is optional. It puts pressure on the employer to reply voluntarily, but there is a risk
in allowing extensions of time in a region where cases get listed swiftly for hearing.
20 It is useful to copy this letter to the tribunal.
21 See para 20.128 onwards for requesting an order.
22 See para 20.129.
23 See para 20.136.
24 See paras 20.268 onwards and the settlement checklist in appendix A at A29.
25 Always put in a date for compliance, and always insist that claims for personal injury are
excluded with unfair dismissal claims. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
will encourage this exception. Also exclude pension rights if these exist.
26 A reference should form part of the agreement (see para 20.278), and this undertaking must be
secured from the employer. Consider whether to permit leeway if a reference is sought in a
different form or there are follow up questions.
27 Set out the reference in full. It helps when negotiating if the employee supplies the first draft of a
reference for agreement. However, many employers only supply factual references nowadays.
28 If the worker undertakes to withdraw the claim only on receipt of the sum, it means that if there
is non-payment the worker can return to the tribunal or sue for the agreed sum through the
courts. If the worker returns to the tribunal, s/he should apply for costs on the grounds of
unreasonable conduct.

APPENDIX D

Glossary

ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) was founded in 1975 to work
towards improving employment relations. An ACAS officer is appointed to employment tribunal
(ET) cases to ‘conciliate’, ie, to act as an independent intermediary to facilitate the parties to
settle (see para 20.268). ACAS also run the early conciliation (EC) procedure which claimants
must follow before starting a tribunal claim (see para 20.16).

Adjourn, adjournment
This technical word can be used for postponing a hearing date in advance or, once a hearing has
started, stopping part-way through and arranging a future date to deal with outstanding matters.
It can also be used on what is anticipated to be a permanent basis, eg a case is adjourned
pending payment of a settlement sum after an agreed settlement, or while a similar issue is
resolved in parallel proceedings in the High Court. See para 20.138 regarding getting a hearing
date postponed.

Admissible evidence
Evidence to the employment tribunal may be in documents or oral. Some forms of evidence will
not be allowed by the employment tribunal and are termed inadmissible. The employment tribunal
operates very lax rules of evidence. Most forms of evidence will be admissible although some
may not be given much weight, eg, hearsay, written unsworn statements from absent witnesses,
incomplete or unclear tape recordings.

Breach of contract

Breaking or not complying with one of the agreed terms of a contract (of employment). A
fundamental or repudiatory breach of contract is an extremely serious breach going to the heart
of the employment relationship. If done by the employer, it may entitle a worker to resign and
claim constructive dismissal. If done by the worker, it may entitle the employer to dismiss without
notice. (See para 6.35 for constructive dismissal.)

Burden of proof
This refers to which party (employer or worker) has the responsibility of proving matters, such
as whether a dismissal took place or whether unlawful discrimination happened. The party with
the burden of proof cannot simply make an allegation and ask the other party to disprove it. (See
paras 9.1 and 16.1.)

Case management; case management discussion (CMD)
Case management concerns the preparation of cases for hearings, eg, disclosing documents,
obtaining additional information. Tribunals hold preliminary hearings (which used to be called
case management discussions) to deal with these matters, especially in discrimination cases, prior
to the full hearing. (See chapter 20.)

Civil courts
Strictly speaking, civil courts are those dealing with civil law, eg, the county court, High Court,
Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, as opposed to criminal law, eg, the Magistrates’ Court and
Crown Court. Technically, employment tribunals are civil rather than criminal courts, but the term
is sometimes used to distinguish the county court or High Court with their more formal
processes, heavier costs risks and (sometimes) legal aid entitlement, from employment tribunals.

Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (CPR)
These are the rules of procedure applicable in to the High Court, county courts and the civil
division of the Court of Appeal. Although they are more formal than tribunal rules, they do have
some influence in terms of understanding the scope of orders for documents and additional
information (see chapter 20). However, the CPR should not be given too much prominence in
employment tribunals, because they are more technical than the usual approach in employment
tribunals. The CPR do not apply in Scotland. If anything needs to be done in line with civil court
procedure, the Sheriff Court Rules of Procedure apply. The CPR are available at:
www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules.

Claim

The worker’s document which starts the employment tribunal proceedings, usually written on a
standard form numbered ‘ET1’. (See paras 20.42 and 21.29.)

Claimant
The formal term for the worker in employment tribunal proceedings.

Closing submissions
See Final submissions.

Compromise agreement
See Settlement agreement.

Conciliation, Conciliation officer
Normally refers to the role of an ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) officer
once a case has started in liaising between the parties or their representatives off the record,
usually on the telephone, to help encourage a settlement (see para 20.268). Conciliation is to be
distinguished from mediation which involves different techniques and is not exclusively offered
by ACAS.

Consolidation
Where separate cases with one or more of the same parties are combined for the purposes of
preparation and a joint hearing. Strictly speaking the term consolidation is not used in the
employment tribunal system and the phrase used is that the cases be ‘considered together’.

Constructive dismissal
This is where an employee resigns due to the employer’s fundamental or repudiatory breach of
the employment contract. See para 6.35.

Contract workers
This is often used to refer to workers employed on fixed-term contracts who may or may not
have unfair dismissal rights, according to whether they meet the eligibility criteria (see para
6.26). It is also a precise term with a slightly different meaning under the Equality Act 2010 (see
para 12.17).

COT3

The standard form on which an ACAS conciliation officer records an agreement negotiated
through him/her. (See para 20.270.)

Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
This comprises the Court of Justice and the General Court. Lawyers still tend to refer to the the
European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the court which generally decides the employment
cases. (See chapter 3 for its role.)

CVP (Cloud video platform)
This is the employment tribunal’s preferred video platform for remote hearings, although others
may be used such as Teams. It is easy for users because all that is necessary is a computer,
internet access and reliable wi fi.

Directions
See Case management.

Disclosure of documents
The process of one party disclosing relevant documents to the other. The term ‘discovery’ is
sometimes used in England and Wales. In Scotland, the term used is ‘recovery’. (See paras
20.123 and 21.42.)

Discovery
See Disclosure of documents.

Domestic law
This term is usually used to distinguish the national law of an EU member state from European
law, ie, law laid down by European legislation and case-law which applies to all member states.

Early conciliation (EC)
Before a worker can start most tribunal claims, including for unfair dismissal, discrimination or
pay deductions, s/he must notify ACAS under the EC process. It is not compulsory to further
engage in the process and the worker can just ask for a certificate and proceed to an
employment tribunal. (See para 20.16 onwards.)

Employee

Different categories of worker are eligible to claim different employment rights. Certain rights
can only be claimed by employees. For a definition of employee under the Employment Rights
Act 1996, see s229. The definition under discrimination law is wider, see Equality Act 2010 s83
and para 12.12 above.

Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT)
The first level of appeal from an ET decision.

Employment tribunal (ET)
Originally known as industrial tribunal (IT). Most employment cases are heard in employment
tribunals.

ET1, ET3
The ET1 is the standard form on which the claimant’s tribunal claim is written. The ET3 is the
standard form on which the employer’s response is written. These documents are often referred
to by the names of the forms rather than their full names. They are called ET1 and ET3.

European Court of Justice (ECJ)
See Court of Justice of the European Union.

Evidence in chief
The evidence given in an employment tribunal hearing by a witness before s/he is crossexamined. The evidence is usually given to his/her own representative, who will be conducting an
examination in chief. Most if not all of the evidence in chief is now contained in a witness’s
written witness statement.

Fact – questions of fact; fact findings
If something is a question of fact for the employment tribunal, it means that the issue is decided
on the facts of the particular case as opposed to on the law alone. A fact finding is the
employment tribunal’s decision on where the truth lies between two conflicting pieces of
evidence.

Final submissions
The closing speech in an employment tribunal hearing. The final submissions are sometimes put
in writing. They may also be known as closing submissions.

Floating cases; floater
Many employment tribunal centres fix more hearings than they can possible hear, assuming that
some will not go ahead, usually because they have settled at the last minute. This is to maximise
the use of employment tribunal panels on any given day. An employment tribunal case which has
been set for a hearing date, but has been not allocated to a specific employment tribunal panel, is
floating or a floater. The problem is that the case can be floating for anything between five
minutes and all day; sometimes it may not even be heard that day, which can be very frustrating
for unrepresented claimants who were not aware of this process.

Fundamental breach
See Breach of contract.

Grievance, grievance procedure
Grievances are internal complaints made by workers to their employers, complaining that their
employers have or have not done something in relation to the worker. The grievance may
concern the behaviour of a work colleague or manager. Employers should have their own
grievance procedures for the bringing and investigation of such complaints.

Held
Where something is ‘held’ by a court or tribunal, this is its decision.

Indirect discrimination
This has a specific legal meaning under Equality Act 2010 s19 (see para 13.27 onwards).

Issues
When used as a technical term, this refers to the legal and sometimes factual questions which a
tribunal must answer in order to decide the claim. The issues are often itemised as part of case
management at a preliminary hearing and are checked with the parties at the start of the final
hearing. See document A24 in appendix A for an example of a list of issues.

Judgment
An employment tribunal decision deciding a case or particular issue in the case is a judgment. A
decision concerning matter of case management, eg, requiring a party to supply documents, is an
order. A judgment can be given orally but must be confirmed in writing. Written reasons for a
judgment or order are a separate matter. (See paras 20.224–20.226.)

Jurisdiction
The ET may adjudicate only on certain claims brought by certain workers. These are matters
‘within its jurisdiction’. The employment tribunal has no discretion to decide claims outside its
jurisdiction, eg, where a worker has insufficient qualifying service to claim unfair dismissal, or a
claim completely outside employment tribunal jurisdiction, eg for defamation, withholding a P45
or breach of data protection law.

Liability; hearing on liability
The issue as to whether or not the worker wins his/her case, ie, whether the employer is found
‘liable’ for unfair dismissal, discrimination, etc, as distinct from the issue of what compensation or
remedies the worker should receive.

Listing
When a hearing date is fixed, the case is ‘listed’ for hearing. (See para 20.138 onwards.)

Lodging documents
This usually refers to lodging the tribunal claim or lodging trial bundles at the employment
tribunal. Usually it means delivering the relevant document to the employment tribunal by
whatever means. The technical term for lodging the tribunal claim is ‘presenting’ and the claim
will not be accepted as presented if certain requirements are not met.

Mediation, judicial mediation
A form of alternative disputes resolution (ADR). The parties and their representatives hold a
meeting, often lasting a whole day, with a view to resolving their dispute. The meeting is chaired
by a neutral mediator who may speak to the parties separately or together and facilitate the
discussions. The idea is that the parties will focus on what they want rather than the merits of
the claim. Mediation is considered particularly suitable where the worker is still employed and in
discrimination cases, but its success is very much dependent on the skill of the individual
mediator. Mediation may be offered by ACAS or private organisations on a paid basis as well as
by the tribunal for no charge (see para 21.53 regarding judicial mediation).

Members, non-legal members
Formerly known as wing members or lay members, together with the employment judge these
make up an employment tribunal panel in discrimination and certain other cases including
whistleblowing detriment claims. They are chosen for their experience on one or other side of

industry (there is an employer panel and an employee panel). A representative from each panel
sits on the case, though they take a neutral position.

Merits; merits hearing
This is the same as the hearing on liability (see Liability; hearing on liability above).

Mitigate; mitigation
Mitigation refers to reasonable steps which should have been taken or were taken by a worker
to find fresh employment to mitigate (ie, reduce) the loss of earnings resulting from his/her
dismissal. (See para 18.34.)

Motion, of its own
An employment tribunal has power to make case management orders and take other steps on its
own initiative, ie, of its own motion, as well as at the request of either party.

Obiter
Where a higher court makes a statement of legal principle or interpretation, on which the
decision in that particular case does not depend. It is therefore not a binding precedent but is of
persuasive authority.

On notice
Where a party takes a procedural step in the employment tribunal having informed the other
party.

Open justice
Open justice is regarded as a pillar of a democracy. There is a general principle across all courts
and tribunals (with limited exceptions) that members of the public, including journalists, are
permitted to watch and report on hearings. This needs to be balanced against the need for
privacy and restricted reporting in certain circumstances. (See paras 21.61–21.67 and
particularly 21.65.)

Parties
The claimant and the respondent are collectively known as the parties to the case.

Pleadings; to plead

Pleadings are the documents which set out each party’s case, ie, the ET1, ET3 and any
additional information (in the technical sense – see para 20.116 onwards). To plead something is
to put it into any of these documents.

Precedent
The courts decide cases by applying and interpreting the law to given facts. There is a hierarchy
of courts and tribunals for employment law purposes, ie in England & Wales, Supreme Court,
Court of Appeal, High Court, Employment Appeal Tribunal, employment tribunal. Each level of
court/tribunal is compelled to follow legal principles and interpretations set by higher level courts
unless a case can be ‘distinguished’ on its facts. Where no higher level decision exists, the courts
(except the employment tribunal) follow the interpretation of other courts of the same level.
Strictly-speaking, decisions by the Court of Session do not bind English and Welsh employment
tribunals and EAT, and Court of Appeal decisions do not bind Scottish employment tribunals.
However, in practice, Scottish employment tribunals and S(EAT) would only depart from a Court
of Appeal decision on a matter of purely Scottish law. Precedent may also be referred to as
‘authority’.

Preliminary hearing
Preliminary hearings replace what were previously two different types of hearing, ie case
management discussions (CMDs) and pre-hearing reviews. Preliminary hearings are usually held
for discrimination or other complicated claims such as whistleblowing in order to decide case
management matters so the case is properly prepared for the final hearing. Preliminary hearings
can also be held to deal with other matters on any kind of claim, eg to decide a preliminary issue
such as whether the claimant is an employee or has sufficient service to claim unfair dismissal,
or to decide whether to strike out a claim or order costs because it has no or little reasonable
prospect of success. For more detail, see chapter 20.

Presenting the tribunal claim
A claim is presented at the employment tribunal when it is arrives at the central office or one of
the employment tribunals nominated for acceptance. However, if the necessary minimum
information is missing, the tribunal will return the claim and it will not be taken as presented. (See
paras 20.42 and 20.77.)

Privilege
Certain verbal or written communications are private and need not be disclosed to the other side
during a case. These are referred to as ‘privileged’. The issue tends to come up on disclosure

and the definitive rules are set out in the Civil Procedure Rules 1998. The rules can get very
complicated, but the most well-known form of privilege is communication between a party and
his/her own solicitor. See also Without prejudice.

Protected characteristics
A new term introduced in the Equality Act 2010. It is unlawful to discriminate because of the
protected characteristics covered by the Equality Act 2010, ie age; disability; gender
reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy or maternity; race; religion or belief;
sex; and sexual orientation.

Protected conversations
Evidence of pre-termination negotiations cannot be referred to in ordinary unfair dismissal claims,
unless any improper conduct was involved. For detail, see paras 9.21–9.24.

Quantum
Financial compensation.

Questionnaire
A special procedure available under the Equality Act 2010, enabling the worker to gather
evidence in discrimination claims (see para 21.47). The statutory procedure has been replaced
with a non-statutory procedure underpinned by ACAS guidance.

Reconsideration
An employment tribunal can reconsider a decision it has made. This is different from appealing
to the EAT and has a shorter time limit (see para 20.236 onwards).

Recoupment
The process by which benefits claimed by the claimant are deducted from his/her award for loss
of earnings in a successful unfair dismissal case and repaid by the employer to the Department
for Work and Pensions (DWP). (See paras 18.62 – 18.65 for more details.)

Remedies; remedies hearing
Remedies are the compensation in money and other forms which a worker receives if s/he wins.
A remedies hearing is sometimes dealt with separately from the hearing on liability, although this
is less common in Scotland.

Remote hearings
This refers to preliminary and full hearings held on an audio or video platform as opposed to ‘inperson’ which means in the tribunal building. These have become far more common due to the
Covid-19 pandemic. (See para 20.228 onwards.)

Repudiatory breach
See Breach of contract.

Respondent
This is the legal term for the employer in employment tribunal proceedings.

Response
The employer’s reply or defence, usually written on an ET3 form. (See para 20.86.)

Schedule of Loss; Schedule of Remedies and Loss
During the preparation of a case, the claimant is often ordered to prepare a schedule setting out
how much s/he has lost by way of earnings and the value of the claim generally. (See para
20.182.)

Serving documents
Delivering or sending documents to the other party.

Settlement agreements
Any agreement to settle a case (ie a negotiated ‘deal’) can be called a settlement agreement.
However, since 29 July 2013, this has been used as a specific term (replacing ‘compromise
agreement’) to indicate a formal agreement which has been made through legal or other
authorised representatives and which meets specified requirements. This is so as to be binding on
the claimant in respect of ET claims (though others are often included).

Skeleton argument
A written outline of a representative’s final speech at the employment tribunal hearing, which
s/he will hand to the employment tribunal panel and expand verbally. Sometimes representatives
provide skeleton arguments on complex legal points at the outset.

Submissions

An employment tribunal at the hearing may invite a representative to make submissions on a
particular point. This usually means the representative is required to make comments or
arguments on law or evidence. See also Final submissions.

Summary dismissal
This occurs when an employee’s conduct is sufficiently grave as to justify immediate termination
of the employment contract without notice. The worker is not entitled to either notice or pay in
lieu of notice when summarily dismissed.

Supreme Court
On 1 October 2009, the judicial function of the House of Lords was moved to the Supreme
Court. The most senior domestic court, it is the final court of appeal for all UK employment
cases. Chapter 3 explains its powers on interpreting EU law both before and after Brexit.

TUPE
This abbreviation is commonly used, especially by trade unions, to refer to the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. TUPE aims to protect employees’
rights when their employer sells the business or contracts out a service. (See chapter 10.)

Unless order
An order, eg for disclosure of documents, which – if it is not complied with by the claimant or
respondent – will lead automatic consequences on the date of non-compliance without further
consideration by the tribunal. Most commonly, this is that the claim or response (as the case may
be) is automatically struck out. (See paras 20.112–20.115.)

Vicarious liability
This is where an employer is responsible for the unlawful acts of his/her employees as if s/he
carried them out him/herself, regardless of whether s/he knew or approved of those acts. In the
employment field, it is mainly relevant to discrimination law (see para 12.27).

Victimisation
This has a precise legal meaning under the Equality Act 2010. It is where an employer subjects a
worker to a detriment because s/he has done a ‘protected act’, essentially because s/he has
complained about discrimination in some way. (For details see para 13.58 onwards.)

Without prejudice

Negotiations between the parties for the purpose of settling a case are off-the-record from the
viewpoint of the employment tribunal. To ensure this is so, it is traditional to introduce the
conversation by saying the words ‘can we speak without prejudice?’ Letters regarding
settlement should also be headed ‘without prejudice’. (See paras 9.18–9.19, 16.34, 20.259.)

Witness order
An employment tribunal can issue a witness order to compel an unwilling witness to attend the
hearing. (See para 20.136.)

Witness statement
A statement taken from each witness including the claimant, which it is intended to disclose to
the other side in advance of the hearing or at the hearing itself. The witness statement stands as
the witness’s evidence in chief. Note that the witness must still attend the hearing unless the
other side agrees that s/he need not do so. Witness statements are used routinely in England and
Wales, but are less common in Scotland. (See paras 20.186 and 21.68.)

Worker
Different employment rights have different eligibility requirements: some are available only to
employees and others to ‘workers’ on a wider basis. These terms can themselves have different
definitions according to the employment right concerned. For the definition of ‘worker’ in the
context of the Working Time Regulations, the minimum wage, under the Employment Rights Act
1996 eg for unauthorised deductions claims, and under the Part-time Workers Regulations (see
paras 4.5–4.7). See Employment Rights Act 1996 s230 for definitions relevant to rights under
that Act.

Textbooks and guides
The following books and guides are frequently moved to new web addresses. If you cannot find
them, just Google the title.
Butterworths employment law handbook. Edited by Peter Wallington, published by LexisNexis
UK. All relevant statutes, regulations, codes and EU directives fully reproduced. No
commentary. The book is regularly reissued with latest statutes and amendments to existing
statutes. It is invaluable, because it updates statutes and regulations with the amending legislation
– something which cannot always be found on the legislation.gov.uk website.
Harvey on industrial relations and employment law. Published by LexisNexis UK. Multivolume loose-leaf, regularly updated. Also available online. The most authoritative academic text
on employment law. Reviews case-law and reproduces key statutes. Popularly known as
‘Harvey’, it is the textbook which is quoted in the courts and tribunals.
EHRC Employment Code and Equal Pay Code. Available at:
www.equalityhumanrights.com/publication/employment-statutory-code-practice
and:
www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/equal-pay-statutory-code-practice.
It is best to look at the pdf version of the code rather than the Word version, since the latter has
some mistakes in its paragraph numbering.
Guidance on matters to be taken into account in determining questions relating to the
definition of disability, Office for Disability Issues, 2011. This is available at:

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/

Law reports
Industrial Relations Law Reports (IRLR). Fully reproduced law reports. Essential if using
cases in an employment tribunal, but you need to know what you are looking for. The other
source of official law reports is Industrial Cases Reports (ICR), but these are less commonly
used by advisers. Most judgments can now be found free on the internet (see below). However,
the advantage of the IRLR version, if reported, is that it summarises the case and decision in a
short head note.
IDS Employment Law Brief. Published twice monthly by Incomes Data Services Ltd.
Subscriptions include access to its website plus occasional specialist handbooks. Tel: 020 7449
