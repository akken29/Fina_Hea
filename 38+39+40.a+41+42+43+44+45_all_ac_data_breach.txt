On 28 January 2023, Arnold Clark released a statement about the attack. In this, the
company appears to admit that, while its IT systems are capable of being set up so that Recent Posts
they are not vulnerable to external attacks (a segregated environment), work to achieve
this is only happening now. Has Arnold Clark unwittingly admitted that poor data security
made this hack possible? And if the system had been built correctly in the first place,
would customer data have been protected? There are certainly questions that need
answering.

Furthermore, by offering affected and potentially affected customers 24 months’ fraud/

Lawyers suspect Arnold Clark hackers have now leaked 45GB of personal data on dark
web

e Legal firm Keller Postman claim Arnold Clark hackers have released 45 gigabytes of personal data on to dark web

Lawyers assisting victims of the recent Arnold Clark cyber hack believe that an additional 30GB of personal data has been
leaked on the dark web.

Car Dealer reported earlier this year that bya

gang of criminal hackers.

Keller Postman — a top firm of London lawyers — has since launched a to help victims of the recent
breach claim compensation.

Speaking exclusively to Car Dealer, the law firm revealed it now believes as much as 45GB of personal data has been leaked on to
the dark web.

Lawyer Bill Singer, an associate with Keller Postman, said the amount was still a tiny percentage of the total data, which is

Title of ebook of origin: 39.lawyers_suspect_arnold_clark_hackers_have_now_leaked_45_gb_of_personal_data.pdf

alleged to have been seized from Arnold Clark by hackers’ collective Play.
‘This is certainly something that bears mentioning,’ he said.
‘There has been a huge amount of interest in the media — and rightfully so — about the first post of 15GB and how it includes

extensive personal data like passports and National Insurance numbers, but there has since been a second post of 30GB of data

to the dark web which has not attracted as much coverage.’

When the breach initially took place on December 23, Arnold Clark claimed that there was ‘no evidence of customer

information being compromised’.

However, the dealer group later said that names, dates of birth, vehicle information, contact details and National Insurance

numbers had been stolen by hackers.
Since then, the most profitable car dealer group in the UK has been informing customers who have been affected.

However, rather than doing this all at once, it has contacted customers at different stages, making it difficult for Keller Postman

to know exactly how many people have been affected.

Singer said an ‘educated guess’ placed the number of victims in the tens of thousands or even above 100,000, and predicted that

it would take months for everyone who wants to make a claim to be notified by the company and come forward.

From there, it could take some time for a resolution to be found, although an out-of-court settlement could be reached before the

case has to be heard by a judge.

The attack on Arnold Clark is the latest in a long line of cyber attacks involving major dealer groups in recent years.

Last year, Pendragon was subject to a similar attack by hackers demanding payment of $60m.

In February, Robin Luscombe told the Car Dealer Podcast that dealers were ‘defenceless’ against ‘an industry of fraudsters
and scammers’.

However, Singer believes that the industry could be doing more to protect its customers’ data and questioned whether

businesses were ‘soft targets’ for illegal groups.

‘This is the latest in a long line of attacks on car dealership groups and they are not doing it because it is unprofitable to them,’
he told Car Dealer.

He added: ‘Dealerships are being subject to successful cyber attacks where huge amounts of data gets stolen year after year. It’s

usually phishing attacks into ransomware, leading to loss of data and bribes being demanded, like in the case of Arnold Clark.

‘This is the fifth attack on a car dealership group in the past three years and despite that it would appear to be business as usual

for some companies.’

Since the attack, Arnold Clark has publicly announced that it is rebuilding its systems in a safe manner and it says it takes its

duty to protect customer data seriously.

Car Dealer has contacted Arnold Clark for comment.

At KP Law, we believe that a mammoth data breach event has happened, yet the full eee see eee keene

extent of how this breach affects Arnold Clark customers may take months to become
clear. Nevertheless, over the last few weeks we have started to see a significant rise in
fraud reports being made following the data theft and dark web posts.

 

To date, the process of notifying customers has taken months, and many Arnold Clark Recent Posts

customers still have not received notification of a data breach. As we publish this article,

we have seen no evidence that Arnold Clark has begun notifying those customer's whose Keller Postman UK merges with Lanier,
data has recently been published on the dark web. This lack of communication from Longstaff, Hedar & Roberts to form
Arnold Clark leaves these customers exposed to fraud. We highly recommend anyone specialist collective redress law firm KP
who has been a customer of Arnold Clark over the last 10 years - and perhaps even Law Limited

before that - to take immediate steps to protect themselves. Find out how to do this

attack easier. As such, we have launched a group action to help affected customers in
England & Wales claim compensation. We currently represent in excess of 7,500

Some organisations use self-destructing emails to automatically delete communications,
either after a certain amount of time or when they request it. We do not condone this
practice, especially in data breach cases where notification is widely used to prove an
individual's involvement in a breach and is thus vital evidence when making a claim. While
we cannot be sure if Arnold Clark has set its emails to self-destruct, we have seen this
happen in other cases. As such, we advise anyone who receives a data breach notification
to keep a copy just in case.

(?) How did the Arnold Clark data hack happen?

Arnold Clark experienced a cyber security incident on 23rd December 2022. This is
reported to have been carried out by the Play ransomware cartel. On 28 January 2023,
Arnold Clark released a statement about the attack. In this, the company appears to admit
that, while its IT systems are capable of being set up so that they are not vulnerable to
external attacks, work to achieve this started after the hack. Did Arnold Clark unwittingly
admit that poor data security made this hack possible?

A failure to adopt standard security measures often makes such attacks possible. If
Arnold Clark did not have adequate protections in place, it must be held responsible for
any loss or distress experienced by its customers because of this breach.

Why did Arnold Clark delay telling customers
about the breach?

It is not yet clear why Arnold Clark did not notify its customers “without undue delay”,
which it should have done. As far as our data protection solicitors can tell, there is no
good reason for this delay. By not letting customers know about the risk immediately,
Arnold Clark left them at a very high risk of further cyberattacks, fraud and identity
theft.

Identity fraud victims Suzanne and David McDermott in Alloway last week

Car sales giant Arnold Clark is facing multi-million-pound group action claims from
thousands of customers following a data breach, we can reveal.

The firm suffered a cyber attack just before Christmas and customers’ personal
information has since been published on the dark web.

At the time, bosses insisted that information was safe but later conceded personal
data had been compromised.

Title of ebook of origin: 41.thousand_launch_multi_million_pounds_action_over_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

Now a number of legal firms have launched schemes to help victims.

Data protection laws state that people can claim compensation from any
organisation that breaches those laws, including for any damage or distress caused.

Solicitors Thompsons told The Sunday Post it had been approached by more than
5,000 people who have received a letter from Arnold Clark advising them that their
personal data had been compromised.

Patrick McGuire, a partner at the firm, said: “I think this is the tip of the iceberg. The
most financially sensitive data has been posted on the dark web and certainly
includes data that would allow criminals to steal people’s identities and open
fraudulent bank accounts. Our clients are understandably very worried.”

Solicitors Jones Whyte, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, said it had also been
contacted by more than 1,000 people who may have been affected and that this
number was “continuing to rise by the day”.

Associate Dominic Ritchie, who heads up the data breach claim for the firm, said:
“We are in the process of building a strong case and will be looking for significant
compensation from Arnold Clark for our clients.”

Customers were emailed in late January about the UK-wide hack that happened on
December 23. The company said it closed down its entire computer network on
Christmas Eve.

The details held by the firm are believed to include copies of passports and drivers’
licences. Names, dates of birth, vehicle details, contact details and National
Insurance numbers could also have been taken.

contacted. Those affected have been offered a two-year subscription to an identity-
fraud-checking service.

The company said it had taken several steps to protect partners and customers
following the cyber attack, including setting up a call centre with its credit reporting
agency partners Experian.

“Upon advice from our cyber security team, we understand that some personal data
has been extracted by the hackers who carried out the cyber attack,” the company
told customers.

“We take the protection of your personal data extremely seriously, and we want to
assure you we are doing everything we can to minimise any risk to you from this

incident.”

Laura McGee, head of personal injury at legal firm NewLaw Scotland, said: “We
have set up cases for each of our clients and claims have been intimated to Arnold
Clark. They have, in turn, instructed their own solicitors to investigate the breach and
the damage it has caused. It is hoped that Arnold Clark will adequately compensate
those affected. However if matters cannot be resolved it is likely that group
proceedings will be brought in court to seek justice for the distress, anxiety and
financial losses suffered by the victims.”

McGee added: “Unfortunately, | anticipate there could be thousands of victims in
Scotland.”

London-based Keller Postman, which has launched a “no win, no fee” scheme for
claimants, said it had been contacted by more than 7,500 potential victims across
the UK, including a number from Scotland. Bill Singer, an associate at the firm, said:
“We have established that more than half a terabyte of Arnold Clark customer data
has now been exposed on the dark web — as a car dealership, this means highly
sensitive records such as addresses, contact information, payment information,
drivers’ licences and passports are available online.

“Our clients are already reporting a range of fraudulent activity stemming from this
breach, including current account banking fraud, cloned debit cards, blocked
transactions, identity theft, repeated credit checks triggered by unknown fraudsters,
phishing emails and scam instant messages.”

Companies caught up in data breaches can also be hit with large fines by the
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). It fined British Airways a record £20 million
after the personal data of more than 400,000 customers and staff was stolen in
2020.

The ICO said: “Arnold Clark made us aware of an incident and we are making
inquiries.”

Police Scotland said inquiries into the data breach were ongoing.

Arnold Clark said: “As soon as we knew who had been affected or potentially
affected, we notified them and advised them on how to protect themselves against
fraudulent activity, including providing two years’ free Identity Plus from Experian.

“Since the incident occurred, we have also engaged on a regular basis with the
police and ICO.”

David and Suzanne McDermott

A couple who have been the victims of identity fraud believe they were targeted by
crooks in the wake of the Arnold Clark data breach.

David and Suzanne McDermott, from Alloway, South Ayrshire, were shocked when
they started receiving late payment reminders in February from communications
company O2, claiming they hadn't paid bills totalling more than £2,000 for items
such as an iPad, an iPhone and associated mobile phone contracts.

The letters came shortly after the couple had received emails from Arnold Clark
informing them that their personal details may have been compromised in the data
breach that happened just before Christmas.

“We have never had an account with 02, so we couldn’t understand what this was all
about,” said McDermott, a 51-year-old dad of three.

“Then we started getting demands from debt collectors, but we knew nothing about
these alleged debts and associated defaults. It has been a nightmare.”

The McDermotts subsequently discovered their credit ratings had been significantly
downgraded as a result and their credit card spending limits slashed — in one case,
from £10,000 to just £300.

“We couldn't understand how this could have happened, then we remembered the
emails from Arnold Clark that we received around the same time as this all started,
informing us that our details were at risk, including bank information,” he added.

“Both my wife and | had vehicles with Arnold Clark previously and we believe that it
is no coincidence that, soon after we were told about this data breach, our details

397


--- New Page 7 ---
Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 41.thousand_launch_multi_million_pounds_action_over_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

were being used by fraudsters.”

McDermott, an aerospace engineer, said that, because of the impact on his credit
rating, he was forced to pay a higher interest rate to buy a new car and worried that
this could also affect work he undertakes for the Ministry of Defence.

The couple reported the incidents to O2, who opened a fraud case, and they also
contacted Police Scotland. “The police were sympathetic but said nothing could be
done because we hadn’t had any money physically stolen from us at that stage,”
David said.

When The Sunday Post contacted 02, the company moved swiftly to cancel the
bogus accounts and said it would have the McDermotts’ credit records amended.

O2 said: “They will no longer receive letters requesting any payments.”

Police Scotland confirmed it had been contacted by the couple but declined to
comment on any possible connection with the Arnold Clark data breach.

It said: “On March 5, 2023, we received a report relating to identity fraud. Suitable
advice was given.”

included bank account details, home addresses, copies of passports
emails and national insurance numbers.

 

Under data protection laws, customers affected by poor cyber security
can claim compensation.

Solicitors Thompsons said it has been approached by more than 5,000
customers affected by the data breach.

Patrick McGuire, a partner at the firm, said: "I think that this is the tip of
the iceberg.

identities and open fraudulent bank accounts. Our clients are
understandably very worried."

The amount of compensation affected customers will receive depends on
the injury that the person suffers.

Mr McGuire added: "Some will suffer distress, which is bad enough. Their
claims may be valued at a few thousand pounds. Some of our clients have
suffered mental trauma and require medical treatment.

"Their claims will be worth a lot more. There may then be the people who
have fraudulent accounts opened in their names who may also suffer
financial loss and damage to their credit ratings."

"| would advise anyone affected to regularly check their credit file and
contact a solicitor to discuss what remedies are open to them against
Arnold Clark."

Meanwhile, Glasgow-based solicitors Jones Whyte said data breaches can
have a "devastating" impact on those affected.

Head of Group Action, Dominic Ritchie, said: "Organisations have a legal
duty to securely store and process the information they hold on you,
unfortunately, often negligent practices and poor cyber security can
result in these details being disclosed.

"This can have a devastating effect on the victim when their personal
information has been exposed. We believe that on this occasion Arnold
Clark has fallen short and the affected customers are entitled to financial
compensation for the loss and distress caused."

Arnold Clark said it takes data security "very seriously" and has advised
customers on how to protect themselves against fraudulent activity.

A spokesperson said: "While this crime and theft of data has been inflicted
on Arnold Clark, along with many other organisations this year, we
recognise the impact this can have on our partners and customers.

protection for them.

"As soon as we knew who had been affected or potentially affected, we

Housands of people whose personal data was efiltrated

and publicly leaked by the Play ransomware gang following a
cyber attack on the systems of nationwide car dealer
network Arnold Clark in 2022 are now coming forward to

had been hoping to collect their new cars were left

temporarily disappointed.

The Glasgow-based firm, which is one of the UK’s largest
and longest-established family-owned car dealers, initially
said that its customers’ data was safe.

However, on 22 January 2023, the Mail on
Sunday revealed that this was not the case after a 15GB
tranche of data was leaked on the dark web by Play.

This data included customer photo identification, passport
data, banking data, dates of birth and home addresses,
among other things.

Shortly afterwards, Arnold Clark acknowledged that it had
been the victim of data exfiltration, and at the end of January
2023, the organisation began the process of sending
notifications to its customers in staggered batches.

A few weeks later, in mid-February, a further 30GB of data
was posted, followed by the full data dump, totaling almost
470GB, at the end of March.

The action is being spearheaded by Keller Postman, a law

413


--- New Page 15 ---

Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

firm that specialises in helping cyber incident victims get

redress — although other actions are in progress.

Connor Hewitt, who works in the cyber security sector, is
among those to have joined Keller Postman’s group action

as a Client.

Hewitt bought a car from Arnold Clark a few years ago and
as part of the sale provided extensive personally identifiable
information (PII) to the car dealership to enable it to conduct
due diligence and credit checks. He was informed that his
data had been leaked in mid-February, a few weeks after the
Mail on Sunday broke the story.

“| remember getting the notification — | was in the gym and |
remember the email popping up,” said Hewitt. “It basically
said we believe your data was included in a data breach.”

Hewitt was only mildly concerned at this stage, as the Mail’s
story generated some discussion within a work-based group
chat of which he is a member. The group shares breach
information to help him and his colleagues have more
informed conversations about cyber security with their

customers.

“Obviously that article came out and the first thing that came
into my head was, ‘I bought a car from them, | wonder if my
information is part of that breach.’ And then...| got the email
to say my information was part of that,” he said.

Hewitt says he has seen multiple fraud attempts being made
against him since then. “It’s not been too bad because | can
spot them quite easily based on the work | do — | do phishing

training all the time with customers,” he said.

“There have been spikes in...the likes of Instagram, direct
messages with links, spikes in Facebook friend requests —
again, slightly dodgy ones. There have been 30, maybe
pushing 40, credit checks done against me. I’ve had text
messages off companies trying to say, ‘You've got parcels
being delivered, please check this parcel”, and all that kind of
stuff. Sometimes that happens when you have ordered

something, as well.”

Many of these fraud attempts were extremely crude and
easily spotted, but many have been quite sophisticated, and
Hewitt said he was keenly aware that thousands of less
technology-savvy people caught up in the incident have not
been so lucky.

Indeed, Arnold Clark-linked frauds are now popping up all
over the UK, said Keller Postman associate solicitor Bill
Singer.

“Numerous clients have uncovered evidence of identity theft,
for example, unauthorised credit checks, sometimes dozens
a day. Other clients have actually reported fraud going
through,” said Singer.

“Huge numbers of them are experiencing an elevated level
of fraud attempts, a whole variety of phishing, social media
messages, text messages. Lots have had cold calls as well —
for example, bogus calls from their bank’s fraud department.
They are seeing a wide variety of cyber criminal activity.”

Singer said it was not possible to put a figure on what the
average loss per claimant might be, but in instances where
frauds have been successful, they have ranged in value from
Direct Debits for a few pounds being set up on victims’ bank
accounts, to attempts to obtain high value items and

services, many of which have been successful.

One claimant, somewhat ironically, found that their identity
had been stolen when a letter arrived at their house from a

416

Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

Volkswagen dealer, congratulating them on the purchase of
a £38,000 Golf, which was most assuredly not parked on
their driveway.

“Whether the fraud is small or large it has the same
consequences,” said Singer. “You still need to get your
money back. You still need to spend extra time protecting
yourself against future frauds. You might have an impacted
credit score — | have clients who have been refused credit on

new cars due to all of these identity theft attempts.”

Those affected are being urged to come forward to join more
than 10,000 people who have already signed up as potential
claimants. More details can be found on Keller Postman’s
website.

Singer told Computer Weekly the case against Arnold Clark
is still in the evidence-gathering phase prior to potential court
proceedings, but the solicitors have alleged liability and put
forward their claim to Arnold Clark. They are currently

waiting on its response.

Keller Postman and its clients are also awaiting the outcome

of the Information Commissioner's Office’s (ICO’s)

417


--- New Page 19 ---
Page number: 19
Title of ebook of origin: 42.Arnold_clark_could_face_paying_out_millions_to_customers_after_personal_data_stolen_in_cyber_attack.pdf

investigation into whether or not Arnold Clark has breached
any of its statutory obligations under the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

“We will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the ICO
investigation. We [also] Know the ICO is investigating at least
one complaint from Arnold Clark customers who have been
dissatisfied with the [response to the] data breach,” said
Singer.

“The ICO has very heavy fining powers [and] we would
expect a broad fine if any breaches are upheld, but what
they can’t do is award any compensation to individual

customers who complain.”

For Hewitt, the ideal outcome would be for Arnold Clark to
admit and accept liability over the breach, but also to fairly
compensate those affected.

“Although I’m in a position where | can see the threats as
they are...there will be people who will fall for phishing as
people do. It can be scary for a lot of people who will see
them and not really understand what’s happening,” he said.

Singer added: “The whole essence of the case is that Arnold

Clark could and should have done more.”

Computer Weekly contacted Arnold Clark’s press office for
comment on the ongoing investigation, but the organisation

had not responded at the time of publication.

Arnold Clark Data Breach

Cyber attacks and successful data breaches have
become more and more commonplace over the
years. Even large companies have found themselves
under attack, sometimes leading to millions of
people losing their information and resulting in large
compensation payouts.

As for Arnold Clark, their failure to protect their
customer data has resulted in over a million people
losing many details, some of which have been
rumoured to be financial and personal details.

Have you been an Arnold Clark customer in the last
three years? If so, we advise you to check if you
have been affected by the hacking incident in late
2022. You could also be owed compensation. Click

Why are people making
compensation claims against
Arnold Clark?

Arnold Clark is a popular car dealership business in
the UK. On December 23rd 2022, hackers bypassed
the company’s security systems and stole the
personal information of over 1.1 million customers. At
first, Arnold Clark claims that they had been advised
that no personal information had been accessed via
the leak and continued as normal.

However, in the following weeks, cyber hackers
contacted Arnold Clark with threats to release the
information they had stolen if they did not pay a
ransom. Arnold Clark did not give in to the demands,

423


--- New Page 5 ---
Page number: 5
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

and soon after, the following information was spread
across the dark web:

e Names

e Addresses

e Phone Numbers

e Email Addresses

e Vehicle Details

e Bank Details (Sort code and account number)

 

Questions began to arise as to why it was that the
information was able to be accessed in the first
place.

What makes me eligible for an Arnold Clark Data Breach
Compensation claim?

You may think that you need to have lost out financially because of the breach in order to make a
claim, but this isn’t the case. For many people that having their privacy violated in ways such as

424


--- New Page 6 ---
Page number: 6
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

this, this can be highly distressing and thus constitute a reason to claim for damages. Arnold Clark
had the legal duty to make sure that no unauthorised third parties had access to private customer
information held by them.

Finding out if you qualify is easy, and takes less than a minute of your time. All you need to do is
click the button and fill in a few easy details. We will introduce you to legal specialists who will get

We will help you get the best possible representation. You don’t have to worry about paying
anything up front to make a claim, as all of the lawyers we introduce you to work on a no-win, no-
fee basis.

On the 28th of January, Arnold Clark released a statement: tT

“On the evening of 23 December 2022, Arnold Clark Automobiles was a victim of a cyber attack. Our
external security network consultants alerted us to unusual activity on our network, and we
immediately took steps to minimise the impact of the attack by removing all external connections to
our network to protect our customer data, third-party partners and our systems.

“While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of our
investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to steal copies of
some data that we hold. Due to the type of cyber attack that we have been subjected to, it is
extremely difficult to accurately identify what has been stolen; however, our teams are working with
our external advisors to understand the exact nature and extent of that data.

“While this crime and theft of data has been targeted towards Arnold Clark, we recognise the impact
this could have on our partners and customers. We take their safety and the safety of their data very

425


--- New Page 7 ---
Page number: 7
Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

seriously, therefore while further analysis is ongoing, we are taking the following steps now:

e We are setting up a dedicated call/help centre with our partners Experian to help those affected, or
potentially affected, with more information.

e We are writing to all affected and potentially affected customers and will continue that
communication as our investigation progresses.

e We will provide regular cyber security updates on our websites.

e We will offer our affected and potentially affected customers 24 months’ fraud/credit protection
with Experian free of charge.
During this incident, we have been in constant communication with the regulatory authorities and
have sought useful guidance from the police, and we will continue to do so to help other companies
learn from our experience and be better prepared for possible situations such as this.

As a result of this incident, we have taken the decision to rebuild our networks in a new segregated
environment, which has meant that our operational systems are not yet fully functional, so we
apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers.

If you need to contact us about this incident, you can do so by contacting Arnold Clark Customer
Services (https://www.arnoldclark.com/contact/customer-services).“

Two elements within the statement have raised alarm bells. By admitting that they did not
segregate their network, they also confirm they were lax in their efforts to maintain an acceptable
level of standard in security systems. Also, should they have not been at fault at all, they would
have no reason to lose further capital by offering such a long-lasting premium service for free.

As a result, plenty of affected customers have been looking to claim compensation against the

Customer details exposed following
Arnold Clark data breach

Car dealer Arnold Clark have contacted customers to inform them of
the details of a data breach following a cyber security incident at the
end of 2022.

In a letter to affected customers, Arnold Clark confirmed that they were subject
to a cyber-attack on 23 December 2022, involving the personal data which was
stored on their network.

The attack saw an unauthorised third-party gain access to data including:

e Names

¢ Contact details

e Dates of birth

e Vehicle details

e ID documents (such as passports and drivers’ licences)
e National insurance numbers

e Bank account details

Arnold Clark's cyber security team have advised that this data was extracted by
the hackers responsible for the attack.

This is supported by recent reports which have provided further context to the
attack. The Mail on Sunday recently reported that an individual claiming

association with the ransomware cartel Play has posted a 15GB tranche of

434

Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 44.customer_details_exposed_following_arnold_clark_data_breach.pdf

customer data from the incident on to the dark web.

Arnold Clark have previously commented on the breach, issuing a statement to
Automotive Management. However, the company declined to speak on the

ransom demand.

“We take the security and safety of our customer data very seriously and
accurate identification of any potential compromise of that data remains our
primary focus." The statement read.

“Once we have a full picture of all the data that is potentially compromised, we

will be contacting our customers to make them aware."

If you have been contacted by Arnold Clark and have been informed that your
data has been compromised in the breach, you may be able to make a

compensation claim.

At Hayes Connor, our specialist data breach solicitors are currently advising
Arnold Clark customers on their rights for making a claim for compensation. We
are also ready to provide expert advice and guidance to anyone else who has
been affected.

how to get started, please get in touch.

What to do if you are concerned about
the Arnold Clark data breach

If your personal data has been compromised following the cyber-attack on
Arnold Clark, the company should have taken the steps to get in touch with you.
That being said, we know all too well that mistakes can be made. If you are yet
to be contacted by Arnold Clark and you are concerned that your data has been

435

breached, the first step to take will be to get in touch with them as soon as
possible.

Following any sort of data breach, you should always be vigilant when receiving
unexpected communications, especially where they appear to be from someone
claiming to represent Arnold Clark. There is a chance that these could be
sophisticated ‘phishing attacks’ which are designed to extract further personal
information from you.

There are several ways to reduce the risk of cybercriminals using your personal
data against you. To find out more about this, read our helpful guide on what to
do if your data has been stolen in a data breach.

 

If your data has been compromised in the Arnold Clark data breach, you may be
entitled to compensation. This is something the team at Hayes Connor can help
you with.

Arnold Clark data breach leads to
identity theft

By Naveen Goud

 

A few days ago, the servers of car dealer ‘Arnold Clark’ were breached by
hackers and the information of 1000sof motorists was stolen that can lead to
identity thefts and online frauds. The threat actors are adamant in their
demand for charging cryptocurrency in millions and are not ready to entertain

any negotiation of hackers.

As the company failed to pay them the demanded ransom, the cyber crooks
have leaked addresses, passports, and national insurance numbers and are
threatening to leak more sensitive information in the coming weeks, if the

victim cannot pay them the demanded ransom.

Play Ransomware gang is suspected to be behind the incident. But the news

is yet to be confirmed by the sources from the Britain’s biggest car dealers.
Cybersecurity Insiders has learnt from its resources that the threat actors
have so far leaked 15GB of information out of the 467GB that they siphoned

from the servers last month.

On Sunday, they leaked a portion of data onto the dark web that contained

438


--- New Page 2 ---
Page number: 2
Title of ebook of origin: 45.arnold_clark_data_breach_could_lead_to_identity_theft.pdf

bank statements details and the car registration number associated with the

car owner.

Security analysts state that such information can easily be misused, leading
to frauds and identity thefts where criminals pose as a person and commit

frauds without the permission of the victim.

NOTE- Play Ransomware aka PlayCrypt is a kind of file encrypting malware
that was first identified in June 2022. Last year, the said group of criminals
hacked into cloud service provider Rackspace, that happens to be the first
renowned victim in their list of targets. According to a research conducted by
Trend Micro, Play has some connection with Quantum Ransomware, a
malware linked to the Conti Ransomware gang that has an established
business of conducting online crime and has a team of research and
development, spammers, negotiators tied up with a legal firm and a call center

to conduct negotiations with representatives of victims.
