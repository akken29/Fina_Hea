Bonjour mon ami Marcel, comment ca va?

| want to pick your brain for your infosec knowledge

If you were to look at using a WAF with / in front of HAproxy, do you know off the top of your head what
open source software you'd use? This isn't for a piece of work, I'm just doing some research in the
background, so no rush

10/05 10:51

Bonjour cher ami Jason !

From experiencq\j know that financial institution (Societe GEnerale in France and many other UK
banks) make u modsecurity as a waf in front of haproxy for security purposes

Not only is modsecurity easy to set up in conjonction with haproxy but it does prove very efficient.

| just sent a message to a former colleague on mine still working for Ingenico in Paris (Ingenico the
french payment processor) and he confimed that modsecurity is still in use on the infrastructure there.

Now to make it really hard for possible digital assailants, extra measures are taken to disrupt their
scanning attempts from the very beginning with iptables

Jason White 10/05 11:06

Excellent, modsecurity is what came up first when | googled waf & haproxy

and ssh keys ate the bottom
so whenever you have time today or tomorrow, we can review that and i hope finish with this task

Also i could not quite figure your scritp used to 'protect' files with sensitive information so i have
worked a solkution with ansible vault.

But we talk about this whenever you can

many thanks

Jason ite 04/04 12:08

@ Cool cool, | wont have time today as there's a lot going on with eventstore and | need to leave early, but
© can see the ansible check mode runs in the pipeline are failing on the PR, so there's something for
you to investigate. Looks like you've still got a coulple of files in the branch to delete - ie the
users_with_password / users_with_ssh_key files.

Hopefully tomorrow | can have a deeper look at it, otherwise we do have another PR review meeting on
Thu morning

Hello Jason.As we spoke about last time, i dont yet have access to all the hosts on the datacenter.But i
wanted to second Greg a bit regarding the scanning of the Linux servers...so despite the stress you are
encountering yourself at the moment with what is going on would you please give me the access when
you have a minute ?

Other than that i really hope things get back to normla soon...i feel the stress just by reading messages
floating around...Jesus !

So there is a new branch called sftp_config available from the url below:

https: //github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform-onprem-ops/tree/sftp_ config

So it is work in progress still but this is the logic you will find there:

-the playbook.yaml has been modified with the following;

> some comments showing the bash script from which the playbook modifications came.These
comments wiull be removed later but i need them now to see where iam

going

> two more yaml files named: 'create_users.yml' and 'prompt_ssh_keys.yml' which are in fact called
from the 'playbook.yaml'

Of course there is indeed room for improvement there as the two yaml files above could be moved
towards becoming roles i think.

But i am working through some little bugs here and there which i need addressed before thinking of
restructuring this.

But already you can have a look at the 'playbook.yaml' to see where this is going.

Alternatively we could straight away jump into a session from tomorrow to work on the proposals you
migth have

many thanks in advance

hl Jason.So the script to move the passwords and ssh keys from the current sftp servers (both internal
and external) worked properly. So on the branch sftp_config and in the file 'ac-iac-platform-onprem-
ops/sftp/ansoble/group_vars/all/aftpusers.yaml’,, you will be seeing all the passwords by category

regular username and password hashed on top

Bonjour cher ami Jason! @

From experience, i know that financial institution (Societe GEnerale in France and many other UK

Not only is modsecurity easy to set up in conjonction with haproxy but it does prove very efficient.

| just sent a message to a former colleague on mine still working for Ingenico in Paris (Ingenico the
french payment processor) and he confimed that modsecurity is still in use on the infrastructure there.

Now to make it really hard for possible digital assailants, extra measures are taken to disrupt their
scanning attempts from the very beginning with iptables
