FAN... could face paying out millions to customers after personal
data was stolen in a cyber attack.

We told how the car retailer was targeted by hackers in a large-scale data
breach on December 23 last year.

included bank account details, home addresses, copies of passports
emails and national insurance numbers.

 

Under data protection laws, customers affected by poor cyber security
can claim compensation.

Solicitors Thompsons said it has been approached by more than 5,000
customers affected by the data breach.

Patrick McGuire, a partner at the firm, said: "I think that this is the tip of
the iceberg.

identities and open fraudulent bank accounts. Our clients are
understandably very worried."

The amount of compensation affected customers will receive depends on
the injury that the person suffers.

Mr McGuire added: "Some will suffer distress, which is bad enough. Their
claims may be valued at a few thousand pounds. Some of our clients have
suffered mental trauma and require medical treatment.

"Their claims will be worth a lot more. There may then be the people who
have fraudulent accounts opened in their names who may also suffer
financial loss and damage to their credit ratings."

"| would advise anyone affected to regularly check their credit file and
contact a solicitor to discuss what remedies are open to them against
Arnold Clark."

Meanwhile, Glasgow-based solicitors Jones Whyte said data breaches can
have a "devastating" impact on those affected.

Head of Group Action, Dominic Ritchie, said: "Organisations have a legal
duty to securely store and process the information they hold on you,
unfortunately, often negligent practices and poor cyber security can
result in these details being disclosed.

"This can have a devastating effect on the victim when their personal
information has been exposed. We believe that on this occasion Arnold
Clark has fallen short and the affected customers are entitled to financial
compensation for the loss and distress caused."

Arnold Clark said it takes data security "very seriously" and has advised
customers on how to protect themselves against fraudulent activity.

A spokesperson said: "While this crime and theft of data has been inflicted
on Arnold Clark, along with many other organisations this year, we
recognise the impact this can have on our partners and customers.

"We take the safety of their data very seriously, and while undergoing
investigations, we took several proactive steps to ensure the best possible
protection for them.

"As soon as we knew who had been affected or potentially affected, we
notified them and advised them on how to protect themselves against
fraudulent activity, including providing 2 years’ free Identity Plus from
Experian.

Housands of people whose personal data was efiltrated

and publicly leaked by the Play ransomware gang following a
cyber attack on the systems of nationwide car dealer
network Arnold Clark in 2022 are now coming forward to
participate in what may become one of the largest group

action law suits yet seen in the KI

He incident began on 23 December 2022 _, and its initial
impact saw Arnold Clark dealers forced to resort to pen and
paper to record transactions, while hundreds of people who

had been hoping to collect their new cars were left

temporarily disappointed.

The Glasgow-based firm, which is one of the UK’s largest
and longest-established family-owned car dealers, initially
said that its customers’ data was safe.

However, on 22 January 2023, the Mail on
Sunday revealed that this was not the case after a 15GB
tranche of data was leaked on the dark web by Play.

This data included customer photo identification, passport
data, banking data, dates of birth and home addresses,
among other things.

Shortly afterwards, Arnold Clark acknowledged that it had
been the victim of data exfiltration, and at the end of January
2023, the organisation began the process of sending
notifications to its customers in staggered batches.

A few weeks later, in mid-February, a further 30GB of data
was posted, followed by the full data dump, totaling almost
470GB, at the end of March.

The action is being spearheaded by Keller Postman, a law

413

firm that specialises in helping cyber incident victims get

redress — although other actions are in progress.

Connor Hewitt, who works in the cyber security sector, is
among those to have joined Keller Postman’s group action

as a Client.

Hewitt bought a car from Arnold Clark a few years ago and
as part of the sale provided extensive personally identifiable
information (PII) to the car dealership to enable it to conduct
due diligence and credit checks. He was informed that his
data had been leaked in mid-February, a few weeks after the
Mail on Sunday broke the story.

“| remember getting the notification — | was in the gym and |
remember the email popping up,” said Hewitt. “It basically
said we believe your data was included in a data breach.”

Hewitt was only mildly concerned at this stage, as the Mail’s
story generated some discussion within a work-based group
chat of which he is a member. The group shares breach
information to help him and his colleagues have more
informed conversations about cyber security with their

customers.

“Obviously that article came out and the first thing that came
into my head was, ‘I bought a car from them, | wonder if my
information is part of that breach.’ And then...| got the email
to say my information was part of that,” he said.

Hewitt says he has seen multiple fraud attempts being made
against him since then. “It’s not been too bad because | can
spot them quite easily based on the work | do — | do phishing

training all the time with customers,” he said.

“There have been spikes in...the likes of Instagram, direct
messages with links, spikes in Facebook friend requests —
again, slightly dodgy ones. There have been 30, maybe
pushing 40, credit checks done against me. I’ve had text
messages off companies trying to say, ‘You've got parcels
being delivered, please check this parcel”, and all that kind of
stuff. Sometimes that happens when you have ordered

something, as well.”

Many of these fraud attempts were extremely crude and
easily spotted, but many have been quite sophisticated, and
Hewitt said he was keenly aware that thousands of less
technology-savvy people caught up in the incident have not
been so lucky.

Indeed, Arnold Clark-linked frauds are now popping up all
over the UK, said Keller Postman associate solicitor Bill
Singer.

“Numerous clients have uncovered evidence of identity theft,
for example, unauthorised credit checks, sometimes dozens
a day. Other clients have actually reported fraud going
through,” said Singer.

“Huge numbers of them are experiencing an elevated level
of fraud attempts, a whole variety of phishing, social media
messages, text messages. Lots have had cold calls as well —
for example, bogus calls from their bank’s fraud department.
They are seeing a wide variety of cyber criminal activity.”

Singer said it was not possible to put a figure on what the
average loss per claimant might be, but in instances where
frauds have been successful, they have ranged in value from
Direct Debits for a few pounds being set up on victims’ bank
accounts, to attempts to obtain high value items and

services, many of which have been successful.

One claimant, somewhat ironically, found that their identity
had been stolen when a letter arrived at their house from a

416

Volkswagen dealer, congratulating them on the purchase of
a £38,000 Golf, which was most assuredly not parked on
their driveway.

“Whether the fraud is small or large it has the same
consequences,” said Singer. “You still need to get your
money back. You still need to spend extra time protecting
yourself against future frauds. You might have an impacted
credit score — | have clients who have been refused credit on

new cars due to all of these identity theft attempts.”

Those affected are being urged to come forward to join more
than 10,000 people who have already signed up as potential
claimants. More details can be found on Keller Postman’s
website.

Singer told Computer Weekly the case against Arnold Clark
is still in the evidence-gathering phase prior to potential court
proceedings, but the solicitors have alleged liability and put
forward their claim to Arnold Clark. They are currently

waiting on its response.

Keller Postman and its clients are also awaiting the outcome

of the Information Commissioner's Office’s (ICO’s)

417

investigation into whether or not Arnold Clark has breached
any of its statutory obligations under the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR).

“We will be keenly awaiting the outcome of the ICO
investigation. We [also] Know the ICO is investigating at least
one complaint from Arnold Clark customers who have been
dissatisfied with the [response to the] data breach,” said
Singer.

“The ICO has very heavy fining powers [and] we would
expect a broad fine if any breaches are upheld, but what
they can’t do is award any compensation to individual

customers who complain.”

For Hewitt, the ideal outcome would be for Arnold Clark to
admit and accept liability over the breach, but also to fairly
compensate those affected.

“Although I’m in a position where | can see the threats as
they are...there will be people who will fall for phishing as
people do. It can be scary for a lot of people who will see
them and not really understand what’s happening,” he said.

Singer added: “The whole essence of the case is that Arnold

Clark could and should have done more.”

Computer Weekly contacted Arnold Clark’s press office for
comment on the ongoing investigation, but the organisation

had not responded at the time of publication.
