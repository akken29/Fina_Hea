1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I mean I'm dealing with a lot of the like basically upgrading all the legs to stuff.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 That's been putting my lab so that's what I've been working on.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Jason's looking at upgrading from getting off of Centos because Centos has gone into life this year.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 So we're looking to move to Ubuntu.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's always doing Azure stuff and honestly I don't know what Claire's got planned so you know she might say

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 ignore Event Store and look at this instead.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Okay, alright.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So basically we have from my understanding you tell me if I'm wrong but beyond the areas to which every single of us is assigned

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 there is also a lot of research work so to speak. Am I correct?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Um, I don't know. It's hard to do research on these legacy apps where even the developers like inherited it so nobody knows some stuff but

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I mean, the estates are big. There's a lot of stuff going on.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah, you know for the most part you're only going to be looking at small portions at any one time.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Alright, okay.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So yeah, I mean I wouldn't stress too much. Get to know the company, go through all the learning stuff all the videos.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I mean it's boring but there's stuff like the fire stuff that they want you to do for insurance purposes.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Alright, okay, okay, okay.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Honestly don't stress too much about like not having too much to do.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 There's a lot to do. There's a lot in the backlog. I don't even know how to see the backlog.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There's a whole bunch of stuff that's in this sprint. So there's a lot to do.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Alright, okay, okay.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So a whole bunch of stuff that will eventually get done. So if you want to take and have a look through that, I don't think there's going to be much.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I can see SFTP pentesting, finding, review recommendation, security banner.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Yeah, so there's a bunch of stuff that we set up. We've got some FTP servers that apparently some other car manufacturers want to use.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Again, we set it up and the day-to-day running, we don't involve.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Okay, alright, okay, okay, okay.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Okay, application gateway, cleanup, all projects.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Okay, I see. At least with the backlog, I see where I go.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Have you got a link to the Gira?

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I'm not sure.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So you've got the first one is the support one.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Second one is like the project board.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Okay.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I think, what else?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Have you got an experience with the Gira?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 No, no, no, no, I was mostly working on with AWS and Google Cloud.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But right before starting this neuro, I started to take some courses on Azure.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So right now on Azure, really, I can, as I was telling you, I can fairly easily get some because I've heard that the company is mostly right now.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 The company is mostly writing an application with .NET, am I correct?

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I know there is some rabion.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Okay.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So basically, what I've been working, I've been doing two things basically.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So right now, if someone is giving some source code on whichever application it is, I can easily take that, you know, get the Docker file, build the container, push the container into the Azure.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You know, container registry and use that to deploy on Kubernetes.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 That is all clear now.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And I'm also trying to get to complete a course on administration, like system administration in Azure.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Yeah.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So this is one point.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I mean, I don't think we actually build the containers to build up.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 That's the dev team that do it.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Okay.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So we look after the health of the Kubernetes cluster and we don't flag any issues that might come up.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 All right.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 The actual containers themselves.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 We don't build them.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 All right.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Okay.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But we are expected to publish it.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 If things go wrong, it's a strange term, because, yeah, so really we look after the architecture.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Okay.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So not all the infrastructure, not so much the, like, the workings of the containers or anything like that.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Okay.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Okay.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And in terms of the architecture, this is just another question for my previous roles.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I was mostly working in DevOps team.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And in my two previous roles, the DevOps team was in charge of finding ways to minimize the cost of running.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Yeah.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Is it also part of our traditions or is it?

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Yeah.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Yeah.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 The unique thing with the AnnoClock is that we actually have like two and a half purpose-built data centers.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So the AnnoClock likes to do everything internally.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yeah.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So for the longest time, I say that I've only been here a year, but the story is that they like to do everything internally.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 We've already got these data centers and all this hardware that they've paid for.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So there's no rush to run into the cloud and basically pay again.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Okay.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So we've got some stuff in the cloud and we've got a lot that's still on premise.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so we're a proper hybrid company.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 All right.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Okay.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I see.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The aim, the aim soon though is to have all of our traffic going through Azure as the first point.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Okay.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So all the traffic will go to Azure and then if it needs to come to something internal,

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 we'll just come down one of the express routes that we've got.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So that switchover will probably happen next year or something.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 All right.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I mean, that doesn't really change much for us.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It's just going to have to be aware of where the traffic is coming from.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Okay.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Okay.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Okay.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Okay.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So I'll have just one other question.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You see the, when you were going through the backlog just earlier, I saw there was one

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 task where it was written, what was about dealing with some SFTP server that because of some

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 pain testing, I think, yeah, that happened on that.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So, I haven't opened that.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,560
 Well, I haven't, obviously it is important to open that ticket and see what it is saying.

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,440
 But just like that, I haven't opened the ticket here, ticket here.

105
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,040
 If I were to maybe access the backlog and go on that SFTP server, the first question

106
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,800
 I'll have to ask you is, do you think this SFTP server is running on-prem on the Linux

107
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,920
 box or do you think it's more Windows box from your experience?

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 It'll be on-prem.

109
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 It'll be a Linux box.

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
 Yeah.

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
 All right.

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:19,160
 So, to solve that issue, for example, if I were, for example, to log into that SFTP server,

113
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,880
 just trying to find out how it is set up.

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,520
 So, maybe checking which ports are open, checking if it is updated regularly and trying to see

115
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,800
 if maybe there is a possibility to implement some security measures for that specific box.

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,080
 Do you think this is what is expected from us if we were to deal with that ticket?

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 This is my question.

118
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,280
 No, I mean, we, it's set up.

119
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,680
 The PEN test will have its recommendations, which are actually pasted in the ticket.

120
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,400
 Our Sinclair will update it when we move it into the live queue.

121
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 Yeah.

122
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:07,200
 I mean, yeah, so if you do do the ticket and you have a look and you see the recommendations

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,880
 and then obviously you make the changes that are required, but if you do have any other

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,440
 suggestions, yeah, just raise them in the, you either raise them in the ArcOps channel

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,880
 or during our stand-up at the end of the day and all that, chat about it, or something,

126
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,480
 if you think it needs more than like a five, ten minute talk, you can always just like

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,240
 arrange a call and you can all just hop on a call and discuss it.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
 Okay, okay, all right.

129
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
 Okay, okay.

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,720
 Now, I understand better when you're saying that we are the ones dealing with the architect

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,680
 word D. Yeah, I understand better.

132
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 Okay, okay.

133
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
 Yeah.

134
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,080
 I think there might be, I mean, we know that there's some things like you've got a couple

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
 of users who for whatever reason refuse to use keys, so they're using a user name and

136
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 password.

137
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 I mean, no, that's not recommended to them.

138
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
 Apparently the manufacturer is being adamant.

139
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,280
 And so this is like the only way that they can move the stuff.

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 Okay, okay.

141
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,240
 I mean, if they, I mean, out of the blue just like that, if this is what they're doing,

142
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,880
 you know, maybe, you know, we can ask them to confirm whether the connection is maybe

143
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,360
 always coming from the, I don't know, I don't know yet, but I will ask them to find out

144
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
 from where the connection is coming.

145
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,480
 Is it coming from one of their own servers or is it one of the employees trying to connect?

146
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,720
 I mean, trying to understand and maybe from that, from that, if I were to delegate that

147
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,960
 ticket, my suggestion maybe would be to try to see if we are sure, for example, that the

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,920
 connections are all the time coming from the UK or from a specific region.

149
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,960
 Maybe one security measure we can put in place is, you know, trying to see if we can implement

150
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,920
 some IP tables that would allow specifically these IP addresses and nothing else.

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,280
 And obviously, prior to implement these IP tables, trying to see if we can write maybe

152
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,480
 a batch script that will make sure that the necessary ports are always accessible just

153
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
 in case.

154
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 Yeah, this is one suggestion.

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 We've got like proper firewalls.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
 We rarely have to do things at a server level.

157
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 All right.

158
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
 Okay.

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 I mean, I would hope that it's locked down the specific IPs, but I don't know.

160
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:36,480
 I mean, we, a lot of times, they'll ask for stuff to be set up and we'll give recommendations,

161
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 but the company doesn't always listen.

162
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 All right.

163
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 Okay.

164
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
 Okay.

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
 Yeah.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,200
 I mean, really, really, that was, you know, that was, you know, what you showed us, what

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,520
 you showed me and what you told me that was really, really useful because now I have a

168
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,240
 better idea on, you know, the sort of works.

169
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:07,160
 So basically, is it right for me to assume that I would say 70 to 80% of the tasks we're

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,560
 dealing with are coming from this backlog channel?

171
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
 Yeah.

172
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,880
 I mean, once we are filing, that's when like clear all this stuff out.

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,880
 So if you're setting with three or four things still to do, she's not going to throw more

174
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 stuff at you unless it's urgent.

175
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 So for the most part, you're only going to have a few things to do every two weeks.

176
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 Okay.

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 Okay.

178
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 All right.

179
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 I mean, a lot of the things are not quick.

180
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
 So a lot of things take turns.

181
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
 Okay.

182
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
 Okay.

183
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 All right.

184
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,880
 So you told me you've been with our network for about a year.

185
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 Yeah, last October.

186
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 Oh, that's great.

187
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 And what is the thing you did for, what was the, what did you find the most difficult to

188
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 cope with in terms of the work we're doing?

189
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 Yeah.

190
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
 Yeah.

191
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 What I mean, for example, for example, in my, in my previous role in France, you know,

192
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 basically the, the aim was to help normal path group to become, you know, you know, ISO

193
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 2701 compliant.

194
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,880
 And, and, and to be frank, you know, surely you've heard about the French culture.

195
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,880
 You know, change is not, you know, the, the acceptance and management of change is not

196
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 the strength of.

197
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 I've only been to San Marlowe.

198
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 So I've not been.

199
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 San Marlowe.

200
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
 Okay.

201
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 Okay.

202
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 But, but, but to be honest with you, the, the, the, the France as a country and my fellow

203
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,880
 French, my fellow French, you know, you know, they tend to be very resistant to change.

204
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 So the biggest issue I had in that role was actually, and believe it or not, was actually

205
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 trying to convince the, the, the board of the, I mean, the senior managers to even accept

206
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 the idea to become GDPR compliant.

207
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 It is a requirement by law for them to do that above all since a lot of French companies

208
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 did suffer some massive data security breaches, but still, still they, they will see it as

209
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,880
 some, some sort of, you know, they will be very annoyed to comply with the law.

210
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,880
 It's unbelievable that that was the most difficult part in, in the job release.

211
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,880
 So, so whenever you need to start, when you start, starting the audit was, was very difficult,

212
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 you know, implementing the, the, the conclusion from the audit was even more difficult.

213
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 So the difficulty really was trying to convince them every day to, to, to move along with the

214
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
 thing.

215
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,880
 So, so my question was actually in the same direction.

216
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,880
 What is the most challenging part, I would say, of, of the day to day task we, we have

217
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
 to accomplish because I can already see one thing I can already see is,

218
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
 I don't know.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,880
 I mean, it's, it's pretty, just dealing with legacy apps is probably my biggest thing because

220
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 no one knows anything about them.

221
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 No one knows how, how the intricate details of how they work.

222
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 Okay.

223
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,880
 I mean, I mean, I think that that's just unique to the issue.

224
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 But otherwise, I mean, I still don't really know, like Terraform, like I've edited Terraform.

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,880
 But when I get to the point of writing in Ansible and Terraform for these, the new AdCenter

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,880
 servers, that's going to be like my first real dive in the writing Terraform from scratch.

227
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 Okay.

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
 I'm still learning.

229
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
 Oh, right.

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
 So I came from AWS myself.

231
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 Okay.

232
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 And puppet.

233
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 So not even Ansible.

234
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 So it's been, yeah, getting to learn technologies.

235
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 I mean, there's way of being remote, but previously I was like on my own, like the only IT guy

236
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 in the company.

237
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
 Oh, a lot of stress.

238
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 Yeah, the last few jobs.

239
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 Yeah.

240
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 But that's not true.

241
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 Before here, I left, come pick up, EEC and a Clelf.

242
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 Because I was on my own, I wanted to be part of a team.

243
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
 And I joined Enable.

244
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 Do you know Enable?

245
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
 They used to be SolarWinds.

246
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
 SolarWinds, yeah, not SolarWinds.

247
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 Yeah.

248
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,880
 And so with me and then the rest of the team were all in Belarus.

249
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 Oh.

250
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
 So I joined them and I was like, okay, great.

251
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
 I'll get to be part of a team again.

252
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 We'll be about chat and everything.

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,880
 And obviously, like the language barrier was just too much.

254
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
 I see.

255
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 So after six months, I was like, you know, I think this is working out.

256
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
 So that's why I'm.

257
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
 I see.

258
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 This is not.

259
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
 I'm just happy being part of a team again.

260
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 I'm having people chat every day.

261
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 You know, they were about sighted me as a people.

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 Yeah.

264
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 Yeah.

265
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 I see.

266
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 I see.

267
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 And in terms of the learning, Claire told me that we have, I think, subscriptions to O'Reilly.

268
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 Yeah.

269
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 I think I don't know what you'll be able to send those details out.

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
 I don't know if I've actually got an O'Reilly login.

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,880
 Oh, so you'll get a login for it.

272
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
 Okay.

273
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
 All right.

274
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 Okay.

275
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 Okay.

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
 Okay.

277
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 And how did you find, how did you find the, how did you find the, the learning with O'Reilly

278
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 so far?

279
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 Because I, me personally, I started looking at it.

280
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
 Like, I came from AWS.

281
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 So I've worked for the zero a little bit.

282
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 So I was trying to go through all, honestly, I've sort of stopped.

283
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

284
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

285
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880

 I've been looking at it for a long time.

336
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

338
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

339
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

340
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

341
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

342
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

343
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

344
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

345
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

346
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

347
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

348
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

349
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

350
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

351
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

352
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

353
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

354
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

355
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

356
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

357
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

358
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

359
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

360
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

361
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

362
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

363
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

364
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 I've been looking at it for a long time.

365
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
 I don't know. I think it's just

366
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
 the cost.

367
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 You can see here.

368
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 This is just one of the sites.

369
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
 This is just one of the sites.

370
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 I don't know what the other

371
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
 Jason will tell you.

372
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
 1-6, the East South Street,

373
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
 or Cabela and so on.

374
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
 As you can see we've got 2.2 THz free

375
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
 of CPU

376
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 12TB free.

377
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
 I don't understand why we've got so much.

378
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 I don't understand why we've got so much.

379
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 We've got 179TB free

380
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 of storage.

381
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 We've got loads of

382
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 CPU.

383
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 We've got another one of these as well.

384
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
 Server side was the

385
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 I forgot which one's the newer one.

386
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 Oh Jesus.

387
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
 What?

388
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 Yeah.

389
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
 We've put all this money

390
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 in time into these data centers.

391
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 That's why there's no rush

392
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
 to move to the cloud.

393
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
 Yeah.

394
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
 People go to the cloud because

395
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 you know

396
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 if you're starting a company

397
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 there's no way you would do all this now.

398
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 Yeah.

399
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 They've already got it in place.

400
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 So again 1.7THz

401
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
 9.89TB

402
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 is free of memory

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
 and 138TB is free of storage.

404
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,880
 There's a bunch of, we're running

405
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 old bunch of stuff that

406
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 we're probably never actually have to look at.

407
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,880
 There is a focus on being

408
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 cloudy when we can.

409
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 At the end of the day

410
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 we don't have to be.

411
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 We could just

412
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 pull back in and run everything locally.

413
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,880
 I think for

414
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
 redundancy states

415
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 being in a cloud data center

416
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 is better.

417
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 I think back in the day

418
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,880
 or years ago

419
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 it was less reliable

420
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 like your own data center

421
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 especially the ones I know

422
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 got a bill.

423
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 I don't know why they're in

424
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 Zooer for Kubernetes. I'm guessing just because it's easier to manage.

425
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
 Like the cost

426
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
 of having someone come in and manage a whole Kubernetes cluster

427
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 when you can get Microsoft

428
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
 to do it for you as part of the cost.

429
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
 All right, I see.

430
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 When you are given a ticket

431
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 to deal with an application

432
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
 and

433
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
 when you don't find the documentation

434
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 who do you talk to in order to at least

435
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 have an idea

436
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 on how it works

437
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
 and is it more to the

438
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 developers or

439
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 is there a...

440
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 Yeah, so the developers are

441
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 splitting the different teams. It's like the web team

442
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,880
 I don't know

443
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 what we want to pull up.

444
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 But I know there's a few teams. There's like the one vehicle team

445
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 there's the web team

446
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 I think those are the only really two teams that we have to speak

447
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 to day to day.

448
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 So those

449
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 if I needed to know the ins and outs

450
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 I'd speak to them. But a lot of the time

451
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 if it's the newer stuff

452
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
 then that's all going to be documented with the new get repo.

453
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
 The other stuff

454
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 they just don't know.

455
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 They're just like, what else?

456
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
 They have to go in the new stuff and look at the config files

457
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 and try and get a general gist

458
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 as to how it's operating.

459
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 I mean, look at AdSense

460
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 for instance, it's just a single jar that runs

461
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 so it's not

462
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 it's not going to be difficult to move

463
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 it's just going to be testing

464
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
 testing it to make sure it all works as expected

465
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 because it's on an engine jam version as well

466
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
 so I'm going to have to try and pull that up

467
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 so we might need to get the devs to make some tweaks

468
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,880
 to the code

469
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 we'll see

470
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 Don't stress out, you've got nothing

471
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 you have nothing to do. It's going to be a very

472
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 very soft launch

473
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
 I mean, it took me

474
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 like eight months before

475
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 I even started having to go on call

476
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 so

477
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 I don't think you have to worry about it too much

478
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 Okay, alright, okay

479
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 Really, thank you

480
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 thank you so much Greg

481
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 for taking the time to...

482
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 I mean, you should be able to call anyone on the team

483
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 or at least ask anyone on the team

484
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 and be like, got questions about this or that

485
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 Yeah, no problem

486
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 Adjacent comes off as like

487
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 rash and

488
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 like opinionated

489
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 and he is

490
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 he's got his opinion as to when

491
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 or how things should be done

492
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 so if you believe strongly in

493
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 differently

494
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 you have to fight your corner

495
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 Yeah, no problem

496
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 No problem

497
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 You've probably seen from our stand-ups

498
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 that we'd like to have a good complaint

499
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 sometimes

500
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 on what's going on in the company

501
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 I noticed

502
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
 I noticed

503
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 I noticed

504
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
 It's been

505
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 very chilled

506
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
 which is different from where it was previously

507
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 where the sprints were

508
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 hard deadlines

509
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 and I had to

510
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
 go on with it

511
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,880
 Yeah, yeah

512
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
 The only thing

513
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
 I did find

514
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 I did

515
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 I found

516
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 a bit... well

517
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
 I have some slight regrets around

518
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 is the fact that, you know

519
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 the laptop I have

520
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
 I mean, when I was asked if I wanted

521
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
 a Mac or Windows

522
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 obviously, I told them

523
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 okay, I'm gonna go for a Windows

524
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 with the idea

525
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
 of installing maybe Red Hat

526
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 or Debian or something like that on it, right?

527
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 But then, to access the

528
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 Oh, no, yeah, you have to

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 go with our prints

530
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

531
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
 But yeah, I mean

532
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 I don't know if it's too late to change

533
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
 but, yeah, speak to Claire

534
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 Yeah, I spoke to Claire because

535
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 the Windows is not is

536
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
 you know

537
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 Yeah, I didn't know if you're like

538
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
 "Oh, have they set this up on the Windows?"

539
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 I thought, "I have no idea"

540
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 I was from a Mac, so I'll act

541
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 I use it

542
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 Okay, yeah

543
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 I've never, to be frank

544
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
 with you, for most of my

545
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 for the past decade or so

546
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
 I've been mostly using

547
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 Linux laptops for work

548
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 but I know Linux and Mac are obviously

549
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
 very close to each other

550
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 and Mac at least is stable

551
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
 because the Microsoft laptop

552
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 I have is already crashing

553
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 and it's so sad, it's such a powerful machine

554
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 like, can you believe it? 64GB

555
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 64GB of RAM

556
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 and

557
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 You've got 64GB of RAM in yours

558
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 I have 64GB of RAM

559
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 on my laptop and 16 cores

560
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 can you believe it?

561
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 In the tell that they just gave you

562
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 Yeah, yeah, 64GB of RAM

563
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 I've got

564
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 I've got 16GB and

565
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 6 cores, i7

566
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
 and Mac and Mac

567
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 and Mac is only like

568
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 I mean, this is a server, I was talking to

569
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 my colleagues, well, I was bragging

570
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
 basically, I was talking to

571
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 one of my former colleagues and I said

572
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 he asked me, he said, "Hey, so Marcel, how are things

573
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 going in the UK?" I said, "It's great, you know

574
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 I'm working for this amazing

575
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 company, guess what, I've got a laptop

576
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 with 64GB of RAM" He said, "What?"

577
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 He said, "Maybe I should apply" I said, "Well, try

578
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 try it"

579
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 but he was also very

580
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 he was, I mean, I found that very impressive

581
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
 and I checked, the laptop is worth

582
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
 something like 7000 pounds

583
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 which is, Jesus

584
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
 so, you know, yeah, so

585
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 because of that, you know, when I finish work

586
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 I keep it, why I keep my money

587
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 literally because you know, I cannot

588
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
 I cannot afford to

589
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
 Why you keep money on you?

590
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 You can't even make a bank account, you only keep cash

591
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 anymore? No, no, I still keep

592
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
 just a little bit, you know, not too much

593
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 like 200 or 300 pounds just in case

594
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 you never know, so I keep

595
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 the laptop, yeah

596
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:33,880
 Me, you know, maybe I'm a bit old school

597
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 in that regard but

598
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 there were a few times in my life

599
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 where the

600
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
 I had issues with the car and so on

601
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
 so, since then I thought to myself, okay

602
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 I just like

603
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 you, I don't use cash to pay

604
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 but I always keep

605
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 just a little amount, you know, somewhere

606
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 just in case, you know, just in case

607
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 the card is failing or, you know, God knows

608
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 what could be happening

609
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
 so I just keep, so I keep the laptop right there

610
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
 but it's a, yeah, it's a

611
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 it's a very powerful machine, this is a server

612
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 in fact, yeah, it's really sad

613
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 it is running Windows because

614
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 God knows what you could do with that

615
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
 Linux or even Mac for that matter

616
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
 but, well, that's another debate

617
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 okay, so Greg really, thank you

618
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 very much for your time this morning

619
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 thank you very much for helping me

620
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
 to have a better

621
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
 understanding of that

622
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 Yeah, that was pretty easy

623
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
 and just, you'll be doing videos

624
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 and all that

625
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 I don't remember what I was doing

626
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
 for the first couple of weeks

627
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 it's just a lot of reading

628
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 and creating videos

629
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,880
 yeah, I think I have

630
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
 a call with Jason to go over the infrastructure

631
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 and that, so I don't know if Claire's

632
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 going to arrange that as well

633
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
 yeah, if you have

634
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 such a call with Jason

635
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
 if obviously, if the two of you don't mind

636
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 I wouldn't mind joining just to, you know, to listen in

637
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 and see...

638
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 I've been talking about like a year ago when I started

639
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 I had a call with Jason to cover infrastructure

640
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 ah, okay, okay, okay

641
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 yeah, in this case, yeah

642
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 because she said that when she will be back

643
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 tomorrow

644
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 we will have

645
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
 a call with Jason

646
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
 to talk about the infrastructure

647
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
 she did mention that

648
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
 I mean, I imagine it'll be with Jason

649
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
 because I've been here a year

650
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 but there's still stuff that I don't know

651
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 stuff that I find out

652
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 in like abbreviations

653
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 that, you know

654
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
 you're just like, okay, that's what that stands for

655
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 but yeah, you'll learn something

656
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
 every day, at least

657
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 yeah, yeah, yeah

658
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
 because we did

659
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
 okay

660
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 okay, so really

661
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 Greg, thank you very much for your time

662
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 and obviously, if I have

663
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
 some other questions

664
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 then you just compliment

665
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 I'll write you a message on

666
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
 so I've probably got plans for lunch today

667
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 for lunch today

668
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 I don't know, maybe I'm just going to have

669
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
 some salad because I'm trying to lose weight

670
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 a bit, you know, you wouldn't believe it

671
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 but I am 110 kilograms

672
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
 well, I've got your beat on that

673
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 oh, really?

674
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,880
 I think

675
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 I have around 112

676
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 I'm aiming to get down to like

677
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 80 or something like that

678
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
 I have the same issue because

679
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
 I have some of my family members calling me an elephant

680
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 so, you know

681
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
 it's not nice from them but that's what they're doing

682
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 so

683
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
 and obviously

684
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
 in my family, we have

685
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
 a lot of people

686
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
 have suffered and did suffer from

687
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 high blood pressure

688
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 and things like that so I need to be

689
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 careful so that's why I want to

690
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 try to lose a bit of weight

691
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 that's a very good question

692
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
 so I'll tell

693
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
 I don't know where it is

694
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 I mean in terms of who has the best Jalof

695
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 in West Africa

696
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 Ghana and Nigeria

697
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
 are always fighting over who has the best Jalof

698
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 I wonder

699
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
 is Ivory Coast sitting there

700
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 thinking well, they're both wrong

701
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
 in that specific regard

702
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 some Maivurian people

703
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 would tell you that the Ivory Coast

704
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 is the best in terms of Jalof

705
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 but to be frank

706
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 it's not true

707
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,880
 Nigeria

708
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 and Senegal

709
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
 regarding that specific

710
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 and that I think they are most likely the best

711
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
 but

712
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 the Ivory Coast has some other

713
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
 specialities

714
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
 that are also very famous

715
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 there is one we call

716
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 Aloko

717
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
 I don't know

718
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 maybe

719
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
 if

720
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
 providing you can eat anything

721
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 I can try to see if I can maybe

722
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
 arrange the next time

723
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
 we go into the office

724
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 maybe I can try to bring some and you will try

725
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
 and you will see

726
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 Aloko

727
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
 is basically

728
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 fried plantains

729
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
 but it is done in a way

730
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
 that it is

731
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 I've tried that with

732
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 some Japanese friends

733
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
 Russian friends, British friends and so on

734
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
 they've all liked it very much

735
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 and I believe this is the

736
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 specialty of the Ivory Coast

737
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
 but regarding the Jalof

738
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 the Ivoryans would brag about being the best

739
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 but they are not

740
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
 I think Senegal and Nigeria are the best from far

741
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
 not Ghana

742
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
 to be honest

743
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
 I don't think so

744
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 I truly believe

745
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 the one from Nigeria

746
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 and Senegal are the best

747
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
 from very far

748
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 but

749
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
 I'm not saying the one from Ghana is not good

750
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 this is not what I'm saying

751
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
 but

752
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
 the Nigerian Senegal are

753
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 a bit outclassing everyone else

754
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 but

755
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 I wouldn't say that loudly in front of

756
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 some of my foreign people

757
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 they might curse me

758
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 for that if I were to say that in front of some of my foreign people

759
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
 but the truth is

760
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 this is the truth to be frank

761
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 ok thank you very much for your time

762
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
 sit in the car

763
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 no problem thank you very much Gregg

764
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
 thank you a lot

765
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 you too, thank you

766
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
 you

767
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,540
 (air whooshing)

768
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,300
 (slurping)
