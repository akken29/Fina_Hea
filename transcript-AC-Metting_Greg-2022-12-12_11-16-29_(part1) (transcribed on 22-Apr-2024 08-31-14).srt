1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 relax has clear allocated your tickets in Jira yet?

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160
 okay okay okay all right

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,360
 has she given, has she assigned any tickets to you?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,240
 not yet not yet for now what she told me is that tomorrow when she'll be back

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
 we will spend some time trying to you know review a bit the

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
 very review of the the environment and everything but

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,880
 still you know as you as you you've been there for quite some time I thought to

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
 myself maybe it is good to talk to you and and see

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
 how things are going every day you know what are the sort of

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,800
 tasks we're dealing with the the issue we have at the moment you know try to

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 understand a bit what is what is happening

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 okay I mean

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,560
 I'll try for update

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,880
 I'll just share my screen okay thank you so I mean honestly for the most part

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,680
 like compared to other places I've worked this is like one of the most relaxed

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
 place one of the most relaxed places so much so

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
 that I was at rents when I started thinking you know

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
 there was stuff that I wasn't doing that was meant to be doing yeah yeah yeah

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,000
 well to be to be frank I've had the same feeling since last week to be

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
 frank to be honest with you

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,200
 honestly don't worry like we don't we don't work to

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,640
 like timetables okay even even our sprints

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
 aren't set in stone okay so our sprints are just like this is what we're going to be working on

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,840
 um while we're doing it so I've basically just finished the stock db migration

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,560
 okay which was literally just moving a my secret Maria db

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,680
 database from a windows box on one of our Galera clusters

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,840
 all right so so basically doing the tcp dump and going to to to restore that on

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
 briefly speaking yeah I mean there is a lot of other stuff to do so there's

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,320
 there's a windows server called ad center and the reason we just had to be

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
 careful with it is because these are old old windows 2003 boxes

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,160
 oh yeah so these are proper legacy and nobody touches them now

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,000
 all right all right so the database itself was easy enough to migrate

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,360
 um because that is just basically well I tested the applications first against

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,600
 it to make sure that they behaved you know normally okay um and then it was a case

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,960
 of early in the morning um

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,600
 switching me i know dv tables in the read only and then dumping it and then

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,440
 moving it and then changing dns so that was fairly simple

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
 but you just need to get the biggest bit was getting the devs to sign off on it and

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
 say yeah we're happy I haven't thought that because the devs themselves they don't

40
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,480
 um they don't really touch it so ad center gets an update like once every six

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,600
 months or so okay so again ad center is another thing

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 running on windows 2003 but it's just a java app so i'm currently looking at

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,720
 getting that working on stage web um 01 and testing that out and then once i've

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,320
 got it running i'll get it put into ansible so that we can

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,280
 um deploy everywhere okay um i mean for and that's basically the only ticket i

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,040
 have you can see um so i've basically got three things to do over the next

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,280
 couple weeks um not including anything we've also got uh

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
 there's a

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,720
 so yeah so we've got a support chat as well yeah

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,040
 so yeah i don't know if you've got all the links to it so we've got a separate um

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,960
 pan ban board i guess a separate g-ra group for support requests so somebody

52
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,160
 comes in saying something's broken or um we need this changed

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
 and quickly so stuff that isn't like project work it's more us reacting to

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,520
 something then you've got that as you can see we've got nothing in there at the

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
 moment we don't make it one or two a week

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,760
 um and one of us will pick it up or the other will pick it up and just give it

57
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
 to one of us to say you know that we give it a

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,200
 split and then get it done

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 anyway okay i mean yeah your first so your first few days

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,360
 you're gonna be tribbling your thumbs quite a bit

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
 um can't think of anything fun to do there's a bunch of videos you probably

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
 have to watch uh like ace learning

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,040
 it's like uh if you go into ace and then ace learning

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,600
 and then click on another link because yeah i i did that this morning i think i

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
 saw that this morning yeah for uh yeah yeah yeah i saw that this morning yeah

66
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
 yeah so i've probably i've got lens i don't know for true but

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,480
 i mean again nobody really yeah that's a bad thing to stop

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,400
 but it's something you know for you to do

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,520
 all right okay okay i saw that this morning so i'll

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,760
 keep that in mind too too too okay all right okay and and and and and one quick

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:53,040
 question uh sorry so in terms of the uh so beyond the the project uh the

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,600
 project work uh i mean first of all the the the the

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,040
 database migration you you told me about just just now

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,440
 um is there a place where um the the related application is

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,800
 documented or something um no i don't think so

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,440
 i think for like the ad center um stuff

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 was that

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 where builder i think there might be a little read me's um

79
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:43,840
 yes they might have a little read me so on um on my individual repos all right

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,560
 okay but there's nothing i mean we don't deal with the

81
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
 applications so like ad center it's controlled by the web team

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,000
 all right they manage it so we need to just look after the infrastructure for

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,400
 it so we don't really have to worry um too much about the workings of it as long

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,760
 as it is working all right okay okay so so in this case then for you it

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
 was literally literally a case of getting a dump of the

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
 database and moving and moving it across all right

87
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
 and and when you moved it to to to uh to to Cosmo DB you you you mentioned so on

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
 Cosmo DB um did you have

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,080
 a gallery okay yeah so we've got these um prod corp um

90
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,280
 cdb host switch no the prod corp's gdpr stuff we have prod int db

91
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
 those are like our internal database clusters yeah i think

92
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
 um stock dbs now like the only real thing running on these

93
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
 all right um so yeah with which they it's coming from

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
 Maria 5.1 i think something really old

95
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,080
 or 10.1 whoever's on windows 7203 and it's now on 106 so it's on a more

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,640
 recent version um the application itself doesn't care

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:13,680
 because it's very simple um but now yeah i'm working on getting

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,080
 ad center working in Linux and um just getting everything set up trying to

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
 get it working behind engine x as well because before it was

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,200
 IIF i guess all right okay okay okay yeah i mean if we

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,120
 look at everyone else like they've got um

102
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
 i mean zoe mainly does um like is your stuff

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 okay zoe is very much um cloud based so she rarely touches anything that's on

104
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,120
 premise all right okay um jason and i are more

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,240
 working on you know the on on board the state stuff

106
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
 um with you know dabbling of the cloud as well

107
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
 okay the aim of the game is to win the game and we'll do everything

108
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
 it's just easier to play to everyone's strengths at the moment

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,760
 so okay and and and and i have the the the the uh

110
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,120
 you might laugh at the question because uh you know i think i would have to

111
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,640
 most likely ask this question to Claire but but taken into account the

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,280
 the uh i don't know the the the project the you know the team has

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,320
 and and and you know the things to come basically the the project we we need to

114
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,560
 to work on soon and and and is there any particular area you

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,360
 think uh i should maybe um focus on maybe because

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,720
 we need more work done there i mean you know i know maybe this is most likely

117
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
 Claire for Claire to answer this question but yeah i just wanted to have

118
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,960
 any um dealings with event store and no no no no this is a just no no no no

119
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,400
 no yeah so mel who left um but i guess you're replacing um she saw looked after

120
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 only events for stuff i've i've read up a bit on it and it is basically just a
