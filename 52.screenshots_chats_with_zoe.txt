i checked the result and it appears that the S3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical
iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since $3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.

Zoe MacKay 13/04 15:3

Hey Zoe i am checking from the UI manually to see if the outcome from the $3 query is consistent with
the reality.| ll report back to you as soon as it is confirmed//or not

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR
iam watching your latest commit and noticed that part of the change:

SecretsFilter: 'ac1-sc-arch-ops-a-tasks-pat-token,new-relic-api-key'

Good morning Zoe. | would have a quick question if you don't mind.So i heard during the meeting that
autoscaling was only now enabled in production.Was it specific to a product or is it the case across all
environments ? Also would you have by any chance something like a link to a place where the
applications we support/deal with are documented ?

Thank you in advance

Zoe MacKay 08/12/22 12:16

tm) Hi, we don't have it documented but it on our kubernetes clusters. You can find the config in the
terraform module we use here https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-tfmodule-aks-cluster and then
the specific cluster config https://github.com/arnoldclark/ac-iac-platform/tree/master/aks

Good morning Zoe...in all honesty, i am having a lot of problems to move safely towards the full
deployment on pp and might require a bit of your assistance for the deployment...and this is despite
having spent the whole evening plus an early start at 4 am today...i thought about jumping out the
window but then i thought it is kind of lame really...so for example i am still fighting with some
dependencies issues on kubectl for azure:

but then the github repository indicated does not have clear instructions for either windows or linux
So i am moving on the terraform part for now otherwise i wont have anything ready.

and it is the same for the admin credentials...

Sorry Zoe i have a question.So when creating any sort of file (terraform, ansible...), are you making use
of the Azure Devops Pipelines Variables to store encrypted secrets separately ? 1 mean does anyone in
the team do that ? | am just going through Azure Devops and came across that functionality

| think i got part of my answer in your latest PR

e MacKay 23/02

We had automation users before christmas SC.Arch-Ops-A-Tasks@aco.arnoldclark.com) but

cause AD was locked down we had to move it to a cloud only account. This account has been re-
enabled so just moving everything back to using it. So the PAT token is just a different name in the key
vault that is being used in these specific pipelines

Hi, no your fine. We (arnold clark) don't get any of the bank holidays off but we get it in our holiday

Hello Zoe....

i checked the result and it appears that the $3 buckets listed is some regiosn are identical

iam checking the code again

The probable cause for this issue is that the script mistakenly lists the identical $3 buckets in each
region. Since S3 buckets are global resources and not confined to a specific region, it is more suitable

to display them separately from the regional services.
