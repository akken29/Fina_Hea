Hey folks, off a call with Dave K.

We have made the decision to Under 23 month dismiss Marcel - he's not worked out and we
have no room for passengers right now.

David Middleton: Are you good to start the conversation with the People team?
Claire : DK asking if we need to replace but we can think about that and come back to him.
Cheers

[25/05/2023 10:50] David Middleton

Hi, | see Claire is off today but before | talk to people team does marcel know from explicit
conversations there is an issue with his work because that will be their first question
[25/05/2023 10:52] Claire Thomson

Hiya, just saw this
[25/05/2023 10:58] Claire Thomson

I've had chats with him to commit his work various times, That what he's attempted to do wasn't
in line with what we were trying to do, so | tried to be more explicit in what | was asking. | guess
it's more of an overall thing. I've had occasions where Zoe has discussed how to structure the
terraform but then he asks me after it, He seemed to take it personally when Jason said that we
shouldn't be writing bash in ansible - that we should be using ansible modules for example...
Marcels reaction was to say there was a module for bash - but that doesn't mean it's right - it's
not what we should be doing - use the tools the way they are intended

[25/05/2023 10:59] Claire Thomson

| guess it's everything as a whole - with so much experience | don't think we should need to
guide him so much

[25/05/2023 11:00] Claire Thomson

| don't know exactly what | should have said to say there was an issue, | couldn't go no that's
totally wrong, it's been trying to course correct | guess

[25/05/2023 11:02] David Middleton
Thanks Claire, from an HR perspective we haven't had an explicit 1-2-1 that he isnâ€™t meeting

expectations was what | was meaning. | thought that was the case but want to just be sure of my

facts is all
[25/05/2023 11:03] Claire Thomson

No I've not had an explicit 1-2-1 in that regard

[25/05/2023 11:05] Claire Thomson

if your both free just now it might be easier to have a call?

[25/05/2023 11:06] David Moffat

Back to bed and get better Claire- can talk more on Tuesday on this. Can wait till then.
[25/05/2023 11:10] Claire Thomson

| guess this is the most recent chat in teams | had with him

[Tuesday 11:55] Claire Thomson

remember to push your changes to your branch

[Tuesday 11:56] Claire Thomson
I'm gonna stick a recurring meeting in your calendar for the end of the days hahaha (I won't

really )

[Tuesday 11:58] Marcel Sangare

(will push Claire ...i was intending to do so by the end of the day..i am just testign a few bits and
pieces before doing so...but i will...

like 7

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

Hello Claire.

Please can you have a look at the structure below for the vpc-0232b16b ; It is just os that you have
an idea before i push this afternoon.

so what i am doing at the moment is pretty much the same for all vpc. So iam breaking them
down , each of them in their individual folder such as below before then move on to merge them
into a single folder as requested by you last week:

[Tuesday 14:12] Marcel Sangare

[Tuesday 14:13] Marcel Sangare
The reason why | initially opted for a single root project per vpc is because vpc on aws are

considered isolated units so the idea was to isolate them in into their own individual project for
scalability and strict isolation from each other.

[Tuesday 14:15] Claire Thomson
so there should only be one variables file and one outputs file - these are going to be the same

inputs and outputs across all VPCs - this is why pushing to git helps - then! can pull the branch
and look at the code and discuss it rather than looking at some file names on a screenshot

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed...it will be as you mentioned below:

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc- 1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Tuesday 14:20] Marcel Sangare

so there will be a single main.tf, a single variables.tf and a single output.tf

[Tuesday 14:21] Marcel Sangare

But in order to make this easier, iam breaking the individual configs along these lines before
merging into a single folder

[Tuesday 14:23] Claire Thomson

most of the variables will be in your files to start with anyway as it's not a module so it's defined in
the code

[Tuesday 14:26] Claire Thomson

we don't need things isolated, | get the original idea - but we want to be able to run a pipeline
across them all - check for changes etc - no manual running of anything

[Tuesday 14:27] Claire Thomson

terraform has -target to allow you to specify which parts of state you want to change/destroy if we
need to

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

yes i understood the idea you had in mind when mentionign this.

[Tuesday 14:28] Marcel Sangare

{ pushed just now the changed on three vpc so that you can see

[Tuesday 14:29] Marcel Sangare

it is on branch INFRA-675/AWS, for vpc-010c0d84db3 1a1d1b, vpc-0232b16b, vpc-439e2c26

insiode each there is a folder called "config_broken_down"

Selection 418.png

[25/05/2023 11:11] David Middleton

Thanks Claire, sorry i didn;t know you weren't well. I'm all good here
[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

and this was from the Friday.

[Friday 09:29] Claire Thomson

Please remember to push your local commits to git it's good practice to push at a minimum
at the end of the day, if you were off sick for example someone could pick up where you left off

[Friday 11:07] Marcel Sangare
Good morning Claire.Sorry you are absolutely right.It is just me and my silly habit of pushing only
what appears to be the best...bad habits die hard but something i do need to rectify indeed. i was

trying t make the comments as consistent as possible. | am just finishing the vpc_accounting script
that will be pushed today as well

[Friday 11:09] Marcel Sangare
so on the branch "INFRA-675/AWS'", under "aws", there will be a folder

"vpc terraform version 1.3.7" with the update to the terraform config for all the vpc using version
7.3.7.

[Friday 11:33] Claire Thomson

why? this should all be in one folder, it's all still in separate folders?

It should be along these lines as discussed

AWS

-- main.tf (contains providers, versions, datablocks, locals)
-- vpc- 1.tf

-- vpc-2.tf

-- variables.tf

-- output.tf

[Friday 11:35] Claire Thomson

it should be "= 1.3.7"

[Friday 11:44] Claire Thomson

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right

[Friday 11:45] Claire Thomson
push frequently, get feedback when you need, it ask questions - I'm forever making commits that

just say "Typo"

[Friday 11:45] Marcel Sangare

yes indeed.So i first rewrote all the individual terraform configs using 1.3.7, tested them thoroughly .

[Friday 11:46] Marcel Sangare

the organization you mentioned above was mentioned by Zoe.i will do that next ..

[Friday 11:46] Marcel Sangare

tam on it now as well as the vpc accounting

[Friday 11:47] Claire Thomson

Thanks! makes it so much easier to read, then we should be pretty close to that PR and getting
VPCs out the way and on to the next resource

[25/05/2023 11:12] Claire Thomson

no worries

[25/05/2023 11:15] Claire Thomson

As | said it's more of an overall thing, for his experience, we expected more - sorta what |
mentioned to you already. it's like he's at a junior level, and | get not understanding Ansible or
Terraform, and things taking a bit longer - but everything seems to be so long and just the
though process around things seems odd, even just the basics like pushing to git...

[25/05/2023 11:16] Claire Thomson

the whole thing makes me feel bad - he's such a nice guy and the start he had was terrible with
the incident but where do you stop - | don't think | could trust him to do BAU.

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson

maybe that's what | need to do - | don't know how long we have - but put him on BAU only for a
couple of weeks and prove he can't even do the basics

[25/05/2023 11:18] Claire Thomson
take ansible/terraform out the equation
[25/05/2023 11:19] David Moffat

I'm looking back at his CV - he's not showing us any of the things he listed under his skills

Marcel Sangare - CV 1.pdf

 

[25/05/2023 11:19] Claire Thomson

| now feel even sicker than | did It's not nice, | want people to do well and it feels like a
failure on me that I've not assisted him enough

[25/05/2023 11:20] David Middleton
It's cool don't be stressing claire! | will talk to people team and you can focus on getting better

| mean he can write a bash script, | don't think he's not capable of that
[25/05/2023 11:22] Claire Thomson
OK, I'm gonna try a cuppa

[25/05/2023 11:30] David Moffat
Claire Thomson

| mean he can write a bash script, | don't think he's not capable of that @)

This is the kicker:

SKILLS

-~Change Management, Project
Management

-Cloud (Openstack, Google Cloud, AWS)

-Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Strategy,
Network Security, Cyber Defense
Automation, Penetration Testing,

OWASP, PCI-DS5S, NIST Framework,
50C management, Firewalls, Exploit
Reverse Engineering...)
qm - DevOps (Gir, Ansible, Nagios, Jenkins,
Gradle, Maven, Terraform)
-Big Data (Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Flume)
-Advaneed System Administration UNIX
(BSD), Linux (Red Hat, Debian)

-Seripting (Python, BASH)

We've seen nothing from him in "DevOps" - given experience / salary it's not been good enough.
He knew he was coming to a DevOps role - made very clear to him in interview so please don't
feel bad Claire - sometimes it just doesn't work out, we're not going to get 100% success rate
