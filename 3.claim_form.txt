| worked as a DevOps engineer, assigned the intricate task of codifying Arnold Clark's infrastructure on
AWS. This assignment was crucial, demanding careful execution to prevent jeopardizing the company's
Operations. Just a week prior to my unexpected dismissal, my manager expressed satisfaction with my
\work and awaited my code submission. However, | received an abrupt HR letter alleging poor
performance—a matter never discussed with my manager. | can corroborate this with comprehensive
digital records of all managerial interactions, made possible due to my remote work nature.

 

 

‘Suspiciously, my dismissal followed a complaint | raised about a colleague's violent behavior, endorsed
by my manager. HR was made aware but seemed unresponsive, with their demeanor suggesting they
weren't interested in a fair appraisal. Throughout, | felt dehumanized and witnessed a constructed
narrative to unjustly terminate me. | observed racial undertones in the actions of HR and my manager,
which | can substantiate. The ordeal left me mentally shattered, questioning my self-worth and life.
Notably, I'm aware of others in the company whose genuine incompetence endangered the business and
Staff, yet they remain shielded.
