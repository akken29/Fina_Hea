Nah its just sometimes a node will get kicked out and a couple of times the whole cluster has just
fallen over and needed standing up again, it's not a massive issue as we fail over to aws it's just
annoying.

On the whole the infrastructure is solid

Hi Greg.| would have a question please.So since you have been with Arnold clark, do you have an idea
of the most common incident we have to deal with in production environments ?

Also allow me to say that it is still time to get into a Choir or something alike. This singing talent cannot
be left to chance ...just saying

Nah its just sometimes a node will get kicked out and a couple of times the whole cluster has just
fallen over and needed standing up again, it's not a massive issue as we fail over to aws it's just
annoying.

On the whole the infrastructure is solid

will get hurt overall
