Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA

Appeal against an ET's ruling that the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of
contract and failure to pay notice pay were well founded. Appeal dismissed.

The Claimant was dismissed for gross misconduct (physical violence) after he grabbed a
colleague by the neck. He won his claims of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure
to pay notice pay. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Respondent
was not one that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. Further, the Tribunal found that no
reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper regard to all of the
circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to what is just and equitable in
all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the Claimant contributed to his own
dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent. The Respondent appealed.

The EAT dismissed the appeal. The Respondent had erred in not having regard to all of
the circumstances, including the Claimant's exemplary record. The EAT also ruled that
there was no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per cent.

**SUMMARY**
UNFAIR DISMISSAL - Reasonableness of dismissal

The Employment Tribunal found the Respondent's complaints of unfair dismissal and
breach of contract to be well founded. The Appellant's primary ground of appeal that the
Employment Tribunal substituted its own view for that of the Appellant failed, as did the
contention that the Employment Tribunal reached a perverse decision. The Employment
Tribunal misapplied the decision in [Ramphal v Department for Transport ]()[2015] IRLR
985 and it is not clear from the Decision whether the Employment Tribunal accepted that
physical violence amounted to gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's
disciplinary procedure. The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed the unfair dismissal
appeal: physical violence amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary
procedures, but the Appellant failed to have regard to all the surrounding circumstances
and the Claimant's exemplary disciplinary record over 42 years. The appeal against the
breach of contract claim was also dismissed.

**THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE SUPPERSTONE**

 

1. The Appellant, Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd, appeals against the Judgment of an
Employment Tribunal (Employment Judge Johnson), sent to the parties on 28
January 2016 following a hearing held at North Shields on 21 December 2015, that
the Claimant's complaints of unfair dismissal, breach of contract and failure to pay
notice pay are well founded and succeed. Mr Morgan appears for the Appellant; the
Claimant is not represented or present, but he has submitted written
representations which we have read and taken into account.

1. The Appellant is primarily an automotive retailer, with over 200 branches throughout
the UK. The company also provides hire, drive and insurance services. Its services
generally include sales, service and bodyshop departments. It has approximately
10,000 employees and has a specific HR facility comprising 15 staff across offices
in Glasgow and Manchester. The Claimant worked at the Appellant's Penn Street,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne branch. He is a Motor Vehicle Technician with over 42 years’
continuous service with the Appellant.

1. The claims arise out of the Appellant's dismissal of the Claimant on 6 May 2015 for
reasons related to his conduct. The alleged conduct was physical violence towards
another employee. The Claimant had admitted grabbing the other employee but
denied any physical violence. The Appellant's disciplinary procedures that are
relevant to the Claimant's complaint include the following (as quoted at paragraph
3.5 of the Decision):

"1.0 Informal procedure

1.1 Minor shortcomings in meeting the requirements of your job will be brought to
your attention informally by the person to whom you are primarily responsible. If
however formal steps are necessary the following will apply.

2.0 Guidelines for the conduct of formal disciplinary meetings

2.1 Disciplinary action will normally be taken by the person to whom you report but
circumstances may warrant someone else being involved, for example where your
line manager is not available or he or she is involved in the complaint.

3.0 Implementation of the disciplinary policy

3.3 The persons conducting the interview will decide what (if any) disciplinary
measures to apply whilst taking into account the circumstances and your previous
record."

1. Section 4, headed "Disciplinary actions", sets out disciplinary sanctions that may be
imposed. Section 5, headed "Summary dismissal", states:

"5.1 You will normally be dismissed with immediate effect and without notice or
payment in lieu of notice in cases of gross misconduct. ..."

Examples of gross misconduct given include physical violence.

1. The Claimant reported directly to the Workshop Controller, John French, and the
Service Manager, Tom Middleton. The incident that formed the subject matter of the
disciplinary proceedings taken against the Claimant occurred on 27 April 2015
(paragraph 3.8):

"3.8. ... One of the apprentices, Kieran Chapman, was having some difficulty in
operating a printer in the computer room. The claimant thought he could identify the
problem and suggested that the paper drawer should be opened to see if the paper
had jammed. The claimant suggested that more paper should be put into the drawer.
Kieran insisted that extra paper was not required. The claimant momentarily lost his
temper, accused Kieran of not listening to him and, using both hands, grabbed
Kieran in the vicinity of his neck. The words used by Kieran in the investigation
were, "The next think [sic] | know he's got his hands round my neck". When asked
in the investigation how long the claimant had his hands round his neck, Kieran
replied, "Just a couple of seconds". Kieran then said, "I pushed him off and then he
told us to get my hands off him and | didn't have my hand on him like"."

1. When the Claimant was interviewed, he said that he may have caught his throat but
he did not have him by the throat. The following morning the Claimant approached
Mr Chapman and apologised to him for his actions. Mr Chapman had already
reported the incident to Mr Middleton. Later in the day both of them were called into
Mr Middleton's office. They went over the details of the incident. Mr Middleton
informed them that he had decided not to proceed with any formal disciplinary
action but that he intended to issue the Claimant with a "letter of concern”, in
accordance with the Appellant's informal procedure. The Claimant again apologised
to Mr Chapman, confirming that he knew that he was in the wrong and should not
have done what he had done. They shook hands and both returned to work.

1. On the same day a copy of the letter was sent by Mr French to Liz Kilshaw in the
Appellant's HR Department. In substance it read:

"Had some handbags between two guys here and we will be issuing David [the
Claimant] with this letter. A copy for your records."

1. The Tribunal found that the use of the word "handbags" is a local colloquialism for
something understood to be a petty and insignificant disagreement. When Ms
Kilshaw received Mr French's message and a copy of the letter of concern, she
spoke to Mr French and established that there had been an allegation of what she
considered to be physical violence, specifically that the Claimant was alleged to
have grabbed Mr Chapman by the throat. Ms Kilshaw decided that a formal
investigation was required. Having interviewed the Claimant, Mr Chapman and
other employees, Ms Kilshaw suspended the Claimant pending a formal disciplinary
hearing. A letter was sent to the Claimant on 30 April, which ends by stating:

"You should be aware that the company considers this to be a matter amounting to
gross misconduct and a potential outcome of this meeting is your dismissal without
notice."

1. The Claimant attended a disciplinary hearing on 6 May, which was conducted by
Laura Fowler of HR and Mr French. At the end of the disciplinary hearing, after a
short retirement, Ms Fowler said:

",.. So you have confirmed obviously that you grabbed Kieran by the kind of the
collar area which may have been perceived as the neck area. You are not too sure as
to why you lost your temper and obviously afterwards you've realised kind of what
you've done and apologised to Kieran. Based on the facts established throughout
the disciplinary meeting we have decided the outcome of today's meeting will be
dismissal without notice, ok. ... Just to clarify the reason why we've come to this
decision is the physical violence, we couldn't accept it of any nature at all within the
business. ... we deem any form of any physical violence as unacceptable ..."

1. Ms Fowler gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted at paragraph 3.21
of the Decision:

"3.21. ... Ms Fowler insisted that the claimant's length of service and previous good
character were not matters to which she should have any regard whatsoever. ..."

800

1. The Claimant had over 42 years’ continuous service with the Appellant, and
throughout that time he had an exemplary disciplinary record. Ms Fowler also
insisted that "as a matter of policy we cannot tolerate physical violence". She
insisted that the Appellant operates a "zero tolerance policy" towards physical
violence. The Judge noted that Ms Fowler further refused to acknowledge that
allegations such as these must be seen and taken in the context of all of the
surrounding circumstances at the relevant time. She did not consider it appropriate
to undertake any assessment as to the level or degree of physical violence.

1. The Claimant appealed the decision to dismiss him, and on 25 June Ms Louise
Pheasey, Senior HR Adviser, conducted an appeal hearing. After the hearing Ms
Pheasey undertook further interviews with two employees who had previously given
statements and Mr French. She then issued her letter dismissing the Claimant's
appeal on 9 July without referring back to the Claimant. She dismissed all of the
Claimant's grounds of appeal. In her letter dismissing the appeal she said:

",.. [uphold that this was classed as physical violence which is listed in the
company disciplinary procedure as an issue of gross misconduct and therefore the
outcome of summary dismissal on this basis was fair and reasonable in the
circumstances."

1. Ms Pheasey gave evidence before the Tribunal. The Judge noted that when asked
whether grabbing someone by the collar should be regarded as very much towards
the lower end of physical violence, she said she saw no reason to make any
differentiation. She too insisted that the Appellant operated a zero tolerance policy
towards any incident of physical violence and that any such incident would
inevitably result in Summary dismissal. She accepted that there may well be
circumstances where an employee involved in an act of physical violence will not be
dismissed but insisted that this case was not one of those. An example given was
where an employee reacted to provocation that amounted to sexual harassment or
racial discrimination. That was not this case, and, that being so, the surrounding
circumstances and the Claimant's record were not taken into account.

1. The Tribunal found that the investigation undertaken by the Appellant was not one
that could be said to be within the range of reasonable responses open to a
reasonable employer in all the circumstances. No attempt was made to discuss the
matter with Mr French and Mr Middleton, and in particular to obtain from them their
assessment as to the seriousness of the incident itself. Further, the Tribunal found
that no reasonable employer would have dismissed the Claimant having proper
regard to all of the circumstances including his previous record. Having regard to
what is just and equitable in all of those circumstances, the Tribunal found that the
Claimant contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 per cent.

1. Mr Morgan advances four grounds of appeal. The Appellant's primary ground is that
the Tribunal fell into error by impermissibly substituting its own view for that of the
Appellant or at the very least the Tribunal substituted the views of the other
managers, Mr French and Mr Middleton, who had considered the Claimant's

801

misconduct at an earlier stage. In support of the submission the Appellant pointed in
particular to four passages in the Judgment: first, at paragraph 12, the Judge stated:

"12. ... The Tribunal saw no evidence from the respondents [sic] to contradict their
original assessment of the incident as "handbags". ..."

1. Secondly, at paragraph 13 the Judge stated:

"13. ... The Tribunal found that the subsequent investigation, disciplinary and
appeal process were [sic] tainted by Ms Fowler's and Ms Pheasey's exaggerated
interpretation of the facts. ..."

1. Thirdly, at paragraph 14 the Judge stated:

"14. ... Whilst some may consider it offensive, it could reasonably only be
categorised as mildly so. ..."

1. Fourthly, at paragraph 3.26 the Judge said:

"3.26. ... When asked whether she had taken into account the claimant's length of
service and good record, Ms Pheasey somewhat alarmingly said that she had done
so..."

1. We do not accept that the Tribunal substituted its own views for those of the
Appellant's decision makers. Paragraph 14 of the Judgment makes it clear, in our
view, that it was the decision of Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey that the Tribunal
subjected to scrutiny and analysis, correctly applying the "no reasonable employer"
test.

1. The second ground of appeal is that the Tribunal misdirected itself in applying the
guidance of this Tribunal set out in the case of Ramphal v Department for
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 when considering the role of Human Resources in the
Appellant's disciplinary process. At paragraph 13 of the Decision it is stated:

"13. The Tribunal found that this was one of those cases where the HR officers
involved had unreasonably and improperly imposed their own assumptions and
Opinions, in circumstances where their involvement was, in the view of those best
placed to decide, simply not required. ..."

1. We agree with Mr Morgan that this is a misapplication of the Ramphal decision, the
essence of which the Tribunal correctly records at paragraph 8 of its Judgment. Ms
Fowler and Ms Pheasey were the actual decision makers in this case. Accordingly,
the principle enunciated in Ramphal has no application to the facts of the present
case.

1. The third ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as to
whether the Claimant's behaviour amounted to gross misconduct or not. It is said
that at paragraphs 14 and 15 the Tribunal conflated its findings on the scale of the
act of misconduct (physical violence) on the one hand with its apparent view of the
mitigating circumstances (apology, risk to others, stressful circumstances, previous
employment record) on the other. Applying the Meek v City of Birmingham District
Council [1987] IRLR 250 test, it is said that the Appellant does not know why it lost

 

802

the case. There is, we think, some force in this criticism. The Tribunal found at
paragraph 16 of the Decision that this was a minor, trivial incident that could not
reasonably be categorised as the fundamental breach of contract by the Claimant.
Admittedly, this was said in the context of considering the breach of contract claim;
however, it is not clear from what is said at paragraphs 14 to 16 read as a whole
whether the Tribunal is accepting the physical violence in this case amounts to
gross misconduct for the purposes of the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.

1. Finally, the Appellant contends that the Tribunal acted perversely in that this was a
decision that no reasonable Tribunal properly directing itself on the law could have
reached. We do not accept that the Tribunal reached a perverse decision, for the
reasons that we shall explain. At the conclusion of the oral submissions we invited
Mr Morgan to address us on disposal of the appeal if we concluded (1) that he had
satisfied us that there were errors in the Tribunal Judgment, (2) that we were of the
view that there was gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure,
but (3) we were of the view that the dismissal was unfair because the Appellant had
proceeded on the basis of a zero tolerance policy and had not taken into account all
of the circumstances including the Claimant's employment record. Mr Morgan
acknowledged that if that was our view we would be entitled to deal with the appeal
without the need for remission to an Employment Tribunal.

1. We have reached the conclusion that there are errors in the Tribunal Decision that
we have identified. We are further of the view that there was physical violence that
amounted to gross misconduct under the Appellant's disciplinary procedure.
However, it is clear to us that Ms Fowler and Ms Pheasey proceeded on the basis
that in this case because there was gross misconduct the Claimant was to be
dismissed. There was no evidence that the Appellant did operate a zero tolerance
policy towards physical violence. Indeed, the Appellant's disciplinary procedure is
expressly stated in terms to the contrary. The use of the word "normally" in
paragraph 5.1 indicates that the Appellant has a discretion to exercise. In our
judgment, the Appellant erred in not having regard to all of the circumstances,
including the Claimant's exemplary record. We are satisfied, having regard to the
findings made by the Tribunal, which are not challenged, that by reason of the
Appellant's failure to have regard to all of the surrounding circumstances the
dismissal of the Claimant was unfair.

1. In the alternative, the Appellant contends that the Claimant contributed 100 per cent
to his own dismissal and that in deciding that he only contributed to his dismissal to
the extent of 50 per cent the Tribunal acted perversely. We reject this submission.
There is, in our view, no basis for interfering with the contribution finding of 50 per
cent.

1. For the reasons we have given, this appeal is dismissed; both the appeal in relation
to the finding of unfair dismissal and in relation to the breach of contract claim.

Arnold Clark
Automobiles Ltd v Spoor
— dismissal of employee
for physical violence
against a colleague was
unfair

In the case of Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd v Spoor UKEAT/0170/16/DA the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (“EAT”) held that the Employment Tribunal had not erred in finding that the dismissal
of an employee for physical violence against another employee was unfair, as there was no error
of law in the Tribunal’s decision.

Mr Spoor commenced employment with Arnold Clark Automobiles Ltd (“Arnold Clark”) in
1973 and was, at the times relevant to this case, a Motor Vehicle Technician.

On 27 April 2015 Mr Spoor momentarily lost his temper with a colleague over a minor issue and
placed his hands on the colleague’s neck for a couple of seconds. This incident was reported by
the colleague to his line manager, Mr French and Mr Spoor was interviewed by Mr French. In this
interview Mr Spoor admitted that he may have caught his colleague’s throat but contended that
he had not grabbed his colleague by the throat. On 28 April 2015 Mr Spoor approached his
colleague to apologise for his actions and, later in the day, both Mr Spoor and his colleague were
called by Mr Middleton (the Service Manager) to a meeting to discuss the incident. Mr Middleton
informed Mr Spoor that he had decided not to take any formal disciplinary action regarding the
incident but that he intended to issue Mr Spoor with a “letter of concern”, in line with Arnold

806

Page number: 11
Title of ebook of origin: 47.arnold_clark_vs_spoor_ukeat-0170.pdf

Clark’s informal procedure. Mr Spoor again apologised to his colleague and confirmed that he
knew that he was in the wrong and should not have done what he did. Mr Spoor and his
colleague shook hands and they both returned to work.

On 28 April 2015 Mr French sent a copy of the “letter of concern” to Ms Kilshaw (Human
Resources). Mr French confirmed that there had been “some handbags”, that a copy of the “letter
of concern” would be issued to Mr Spoor, and that he was sending this to Ms Kilshaw for her
records. Upon the receipt of Mr French’s email Ms Kilshaw became concerned that there had
been an incident of physical violence, and decided that a formal investigation of the incident
was required. Ms Kilshaw therefore interviewed Mr Spoor, Mr Chapman, and other colleagues,
and suspended Mr Spoor pending a formal disciplinary hearing. On 30 April 2015 Ms Kilshaw
sent Mr Spoor a letter stating that an outcome of the hearing may be dismissal.

On 6 May 2015 Mr Spoor attended a hearing. Mr French and Ms Fowler (Human Resources) also
attended the hearing. At the end of the hearing Ms Fowler confirmed that Mr Spoor would be
dismissed for gross misconduct as “...we deem any form of physical violence as unacceptable...”.
She also stated that the company had a “zero tolerance policy” to physical violence and did not
consider it appropriate to undertake a review of the context of the incident, including Mr Spoor’s
length of service (42 years), his exemplary disciplinary record, and the level or degree of physical
violence.

Mr Spoor appealed the decision to dismiss him but this was rejected. Mr Spoor made a claim to
the Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal, and this came to a full
hearing on 21 December 2015. The Employment Tribunal found that the investigation
undertaken by Arnold Clark was not reasonable in the circumstances as no attempt was made to
discuss the matter with Mr French or Middleton and, in particular, to obtain their view of the
seriousness of the incident. Further, the Tribunal also found that no reasonable employer would
have dismissed in the circumstances, having proper regard to all of the circumstances including
his length of service and previous record. The Tribunal did, however, find that Mr Spoor
contributed to his own dismissal to the extent of 50 percent.

Arnold Clark appealed against this decision on four grounds, including that the Tribunal had
impermissibly substituted its own view for that of Arnold Clark (“the First Ground”), that the
Tribunal had misdirected itself by applying the guidance in the case of Ramphal v Department of
Transport [2015] IRLR 985 (“the Second Ground”), that the Tribunal failed to make any finding as
to whether Mr Spoor’s behaviour constituted gross misconduct (“the Third Ground”), and that
the Tribunal had acted perversely as this was not a decision that any reasonable Tribunal
properly directly itself on the law could have reached (“the Fourth Ground”).

The Employment Appeal Tribunal rejected the First Ground and Fourth Grounds of appeal but
found that Arnold Clark’s appeals on the Second Ground Third Ground had some merit, as,
respectively, Ramphal was not applicable in the circumstances and the Tribunal had failed to
give specific reasons as to whether they had found Mr Spoor’s behaviour to be gross misconduct
under Arnold Clark’s disciplinary policy. However, the EAT found that the merits of these grounds
of appeal were not sufficient to merit the upholding of the appeal, as the EAT were satisfied that
Arnold Clark had failed to take into account all the circumstances (including Mr Spoor’s
exemplary service and the seriousness of the incident) when reaching its decision to dismiss.

807

The EAT also dismissed an argument that Mr Spoor had contributed to his own dismissal to the
extent of 100 percent.

The EAT therefore rejected Arnold Clark’s appeal.

Chris Hadrill, a specialist employment solicitor at Redmans, commented on the case: “This case
shows that employers must carefully apply their disciplinary policy and take into account all of
the circumstances of the case before making any decision to dismiss - a failure to do so may
render any decision to dismiss unfair.”
