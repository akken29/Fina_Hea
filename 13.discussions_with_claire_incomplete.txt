Sorry Claire, but with the details you gave me during the discussion, i understand that my colleague
(Jason) might be facing some difficult circumstances that are therefore valid .

Soi think i will just do like you and try not to pay too much attention to some bits and pieces that are
not done with a bad intention

[12/01/2023 17:13] Marcel Sangare

So let's just forget about that discussion we had this afternoon...as i was not aware of these
challenges.

I think it is better to try to support him rather and i willjoin you in that regard.

(12/01/2023 17:15] Marcel Sangare

Thank you for taking the time to listen and to help me understand what the situation really is.
