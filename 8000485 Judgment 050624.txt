REASONS
Introduction

1. The claimant is of Black ethnicity. He was employed by the respondent as
Dev Ops Engineer from 7 December 2022 until he was dismissed on 22
June 2023. He complains direct race discrimination under section 13 of the
Equality Act 2010 (“EA”) and harassment related to race under section 26
of the EA. He complains of victimisation because he did a protected act
under section 27 of EA. He also complains that he made protected
disclosures for the purposes of Part IVA of the Employment Rights Act
1996 (“ERA”) and says he suffered a detriment on the ground that he did
so as well as being dismissed by reason of having done so.

2. The respondent denies the allegations in their entirety.

3. A final hearing took place at the Glasgow Tribunal over 5 days. One
witness, Jason White, gave his evidence via a video link. All other
witnesses attended the Tribunal in person. The claimant gave evidence on
his own behalf. The respondent led evidence from Jason White, Dev Ops
Engineer, Claire Thomson, the claimant’s line manager, David Moffet, Ms
Thomson's line manager and Laura Cooper, HR Assistant. Evidence was
taken orally from the witnesses. The Tribunal was referred to a joint set of
productions running to approximately 1,500 pages. Most documents in the
file were not, in the event, referred to in evidence. Among others, around
600 pages of screenshots were included the file, the majority of which were
not referred to. There were also around 50 pages of gitlogs which were not
admitted into evidence.

4. The claimant was permitted to play recordings of certain excerpts of

conversations he had made. He also asked but was not ultimately
permitted to play a covertly made recording of a meeting he held with Ms
Thomson on 13 June 2024. This request was ultimately refused on the
grounds of relevance / proportionality. Oral reasons were given. An
adjournment was given for CT to listen to the recording after which the
claimant was able to cross examine her on the discussions during that
meeting. In the event, the facts of that meeting were not materially
disputed.

Issues to be decided

6. The updated and final list of issues in the case, following permitted

amendments to the claim, is as follows:
Time bar

(i) Early conciliation with R was notified to ACAS on 31 July
2023. The EC Certificate was issued on 4 September 2023.
The ET1 was presented on 25 September 2023. Given the
date the claim form was presented and the dates of early
conciliation, any complaint about something that happened
before 1 May 2023 may not have been brought in time.

(ii) Were the discrimination, harassment and_ victimisation
complaints made within the time limit in section 123 of the
Equality Act 2010? The Tribunal will decide:

1. Was the claim made to the Tribunal within three months
(plus early conciliation extension) of the act to which the

complaint relates?
2. If not, was there conduct extending over a period?

3. If so, was the claim made to the Tribunal within three
months (plus early conciliation extension) of the end of
that period?

4. If not, were the claims made within a further period that
the Tribunal thinks is just and equitable? The Tribunal

will decide:

i. Why were the complaints not made to the

Tribunal in time?

ii. In any event, is it just and equitable in all the

circumstances to extend time?

Victimisation

7.

Did C do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under section
27(2)(c) or (d) Equality Act 2010? C avers that:

(i) On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, C
told his manager CT that the way in which JW had spoken to
him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was
contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an
effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole

team.

(ii) He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and

prejudice.

the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing
to insecurity in the department and was having an effect on his
own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

(ii) On or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach
of R’s systems in December 2022, C told his manager CT that
the action of JW in copying passwords from the old system to the
new one was contrary to R’s legal obligations following a cyber
security breach.

(iii) On or about 19 June 2023, C emailed CT, DM and R’s HR
department to report on-going verbal abuse by JW as well as
alleged IT malpractice and breach of R’s legal obligations
relating to data protection.

10. Was C subjected to the following detriment? C says that Management
and HR terminated his employment in a way that was predetermined and
not in accordance with R’s procedures for managing performance without

any proper basis for doing so.

because he had made one or more of the above protected disclosures?

Whistleblowing Automatically Unfair Dismissal

Harassment related to race

13.

14.

15.

16.

Did C suffer unwanted conduct, as follows:

(i) Over a period between 12 January and around 19 June
2023 JW, Dev Ops Engineer, shouted at C repeatedly at daily
team meetings, would not let C speak, told him: “shut up, I’m
speaking”; belittled C and criticised his work in front of others.
In particular, at a meeting in early June 2023, JW criticised a
code C had written for AWS which involved a modular
approach. He laughed at C in front of those present and
mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you’re

doing. Let me tell you one more time...”
Was this related to C’s race?

If so, did this conduct have the purpose or effect of violating his dignity,
or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive

environment for C?

If not, did it have that effect? The Tribunal will take into account C’s
perception, the other circumstances of the case and whether it is
reasonable for the conduct to have had that effect.

Direct race discrimination

17.

Did R, because of C’s race, treat C less favourably than it would have

treated others? The less favourable treatment alleged by C is as follows.

(i) | JW, Dev Ops Engineer was permitted by C’s line manager, CT,
and second line manager, DM, to behave in an aggressive and
disrespectful way towards C in the manner described below at
video meetings at which they were present and to humiliate C
without any steps being taken to challenge his behaviour. By
contrast, C was subjected to R’s performance procedure and
dismissed.

(ii) On or about 13 June 2023 C’s line manager, CT,
misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with C
that day.

(iii) HR did not follow R’s performance procedure in relation to C.

(iv) C sent the code he had written to DM to check. Despite being
a software developer, DM did not check C’s code.

(v) C’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
meeting at which he was dismissed indicating prejudgment.

(vi) C was dismissed on grounds of poor performance. He will
argue that, as his performance was not poor, he was dismissed

because of his race.
C’s comparators are JW and other white employees of R.

Prior to the final hearing it had been ordered that the hearing would decide
liability only and that, if successful, a separate hearing on remedy would
be listed.

Findings in Fact

21.

22.

23.

The following facts, and any further facts set out in the ‘Discussion and
Decision’ section, are found to be proved on the balance of probabilities or
have been agreed by the parties. The facts found are those relevant and
necessary to my determination of the issues. They are not intended to be
a full chronology of events.

C applied for a Dev Ops Engineer post with R after seeing it advertised. R
was impressed with C’s CV and, following a single interview conducted by
CT and DM, he was appointed to the role.

C is of Black ethnicity. He was employed as a Dev Ops from 7 December
2022 until he was dismissed on 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from

home in his role with occasional attendance at R’s offices in Hillington.

C was issued with a contract of employment on or about 24 November

2022. It included the following clauses, so far as relevant:

Introduction

In Arnold Clark it is essential to maintain standards of performance to
assist in the smooth running of the business. This procedure is designed
to help and encourage you to achieve and maintain standards of conduct,
job performance and attendance. Its aim is also to ensure consistent and

fair treatment of all employees.

3.4 If improvement is required in your conduct, performance or
attendance as part of this procedure, you will be informed of this
fact in writing, as well as the period during which it will be monitored
and the consequences of failing to carry it out satisfactorily. It is
important that you participate in this process, so that any additional
training or support can be discussed. The position will normally be
reviewed with immediate effect and you will be advised of the

timescale for improvement in writing.

7.0 Dismissal for employees with less than 24 months’ service

7.1 in the case of employees with less than 24 months’ service, the
above procedure will not normally apply. Please contact the People

Team in the first instance for further information.

C was employed in a team known as the ArchOps Team which comprised
4 or 5 Dev Ops Engineers and their line manager, CT (the Lead Engineer
for the team). The other Dev Ops Engineers in the team were called Zoe
Mackie, Greg Dolan and Jason White (JW). They were all of white
ethnicity, other than C. CT had a daily team meeting with her team
members every afternoon for around an hour by’ Teams

videoconferencing. CT reported to DM, Head of Reliability Engineering.

In around December 2022, R suffered a significant cyber security breach.
R employs a separate cyber security team and C was not recruited to work
in that team or specifically on that matter. Nevertheless, the ‘ripples’ from
that incident were felt in C’s team and their work was affected by what had
happened. R brought in specialist third party consultants to assist them in

dealing with the matter. In the period between December 2022 and June
2023, C’s colleague, Greg Dolan was deployed for significant periods to
work generated by the cyber security incident.

JW, another of C’s team mates, had ADHD. He had a direct and forthright
manner that might be perceived as brusque. He regularly swore and used
the f word during the team meetings, especially when expressing his
dissatisfaction about the work or approach taken by other teams who were
not present. There was another team for which JW had particular disdain
about whom he often swore and who he described using language like
“incompetent idiots”. They were a team of mostly white employees of
British or European white ethnicity. CT also had a tendency to swear and
sometimes used the f word during team meetings. The swearing was not

directed at anyone present.

In December 2022, C had conversations with Greg Dolan about JW and
his experience of working for R. G Dolan said words along the lines, “Jason
comes off as rash and opinionated ... you have to fight your corner. It’s a
good place to work. Very Chilled. Different to where | was previously.”

Although C was surprised and troubled by JW’s mode of interacting during
team meetings, he did not experience any interaction with JW directed at
him personally which caused him concern until 12 January 2023. He did
witness JW making criticisms of approaches at times by others within the
team before that date and, more commonly, of others outside the team.

On the morning of 12 January, C was participating in a Group Chat on
Teams. This was not by audio or video but was conducted in text format.
C, CT, JW, Zoe and Greg could see the chat. C explained he had finished
work on the design of a new server. In it, JW was critical of C’s approach.
He made blunt comments to the effect that it was useless and not the way
he would do things and not the way things were done at R. He did not use

swear words.

C was unhappy at JW’s comments and messaged CT to request a call to
discuss it. CT and JW (only) then had an audio call with C. JW dominated
the call and CT said relatively little. JW explained again that C’s proposed
solution did not fit with the way R did things. JW expressed his point of


--- New Page 11 ---
Page number: 11
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 11

view robustly. When C sought to speak, JW insisted that he was speaking.
JW said words like, “I’ve told you this before”. C felt upset about the way
JW spoke to him. He felt that JW did not let him or CT get a word in
edgewise. C felt shut down by JW’s words to the effect “I’m speaking”, and
5 C became withdrawn. He did not try to contribute any further comments
but remained quiet until the end of the call. The call lasted no more than

around 20 minutes.

32. C felt strongly that the criticisms of JW were unwarranted. He believed his
approach to the work was preferable to that advocated by JW and CT. C
10 considered JW’s suggestion to be out of touch with the latest best practice.
C had been working on a solution that would create new passwords for R’s
partners using the system which C felt was the correct approach following
the cyber security breach R had experienced. CT and JW disagreed with
C that this was either required or helpful. CT did not regard JW’s tone on
15 the call to be as serious as C did though she felt he had been forthright.

33. After the three-way call, C sent a message to CT asking for a discussion.
CT then had a separate call with C alone. C complained he had found JW
to be insulting and condescending in their earlier call. He said he found the
way JW spoke to him unacceptable. He told her he felt JW’s language was
20 condescending and insulting. C did not tell CT that he felt JW had been
‘abusive’ or ‘violent’, nor did he use words to that effect. He did not tell CT
that JW was “contributing to insecurity in the department” or that JW was
“having an effect on C’s health and safety and that of the whole team”. Nor
did he use words to that effect.

25 34. During the call, CT explained to C that JW had ADHD. She acknowledged
that JW could, at times, come across in a way that was not intended; that
he could say things in “the wrong way”. She explained that on one
occasion he had told a member of another team they should ‘go and
educate themselves’, and that she had been a bit surprised by that. She

30 told C not to worry, that she would talk to JW but that C needed to know
that this was the way he was and that he was not a bad person. CT said
because of his ADHD, JW had challenges in managing his anger. C
appeared to be pacified on learning about JW’s ADHD.

In that call or in another call early in 2023, C also discussed the
methodology he was following which was a modular approach to the
coding. CT told him he should give up on that modular approach and make
sure the configurations he was working on could go in a single file. C was
not in agreement that this was the better approach but he did not refuse to
work as CT had instructed.

In the same call or another one in early 2023, C also raised with CT the
practice of copying old passwords to the new server about which he had
concerns. CT disagreed. She said words to the effect that the passwords
were encrypted and were not captured by the cyber breach because the
particular server was not live. C did not refuse to follow CT’s instruction
about the approach to be taken. C did not tell CT during this call or any
other that the action of JW in copying passwords from the old system to
the new one was contrary to R’s legal obligations following a cyber security
breach. Nor did he use any words to similar effect.

After the call, C sent a message to CT asking for a discussion. Excerpts
are reproduced below.

circumstances that are therefore valid.

some bits and pieces that are not done with a bad intention

So let's just forget about that discussion we had this afternoon... as | was

not aware of these challenges.

Thank you for taking the time to listen and to help me understand what the

situation really is.
[12/01/2023 17:15] Claire Thomson

again, it's absolutely fine and I'm glad you feel like you could raise the
subject with me!

CT understood from that exchange that C did not wish her to raise his
concerns with JW about JW’s behaviour that day and she did not do so.
She did not feel that JW’s conduct warranted an intervention where C did
not wish to insist on one. C did not contact CT at any time thereafter to ask
for action to be taken or to enquire if action had been taken.

On 3 February 2023, C had a discussion with Zoe Mackie about JW. ZM
said words to the effect that the team used to be worse; that there were
lots of strong opinions; and that only JW remained of those who had been
in the time during the period she was referring to.

There were no further interactions between C and JW which caused him
concern after 12 January until a Team meeting at some point in February
or early March 2023. C had been discussing with CT and DM a proposal
to install a firewall solution on a system. This had been C’s idea and he
believed it was a good one and a cost effective one. During the team
meeting that proposal came up and JW disagreed with it. He said, “We will
not install a firewall on that server.” He did not shout these words. C felt
furious. He felt he had been undermined by JW and that so too had his
managers, CT and DM. However, C wished to avoid any conflict or
confrontation, and did not engage in an exchange about it. C did not install
the proposed firewall.

On 7 March 2023, C’s probationary period expired. R conducted no
probationary review meeting with C. He was not informed if he had passed
his probationary period or if it had been extended. R did not discuss with
him any monitoring of his performance or conduct throughout the

probationary period.

Neither CT nor any other manager sought formally or informally to discuss
with C his performance in his role until the events of June 2023.

However, from March / April 2023, CT had a number of conversations or
text chats with C about projects he was working on.

The Dev Ops Engineer role which C held was concerned with managing
some of R’s server estate. It is primarily a coding role. The ArchOps team
uses languages Ansible and Terraform to code. These allow the Dev Ops
Engineers to articulate in code how the server estate should look. If
someone writes the wrong code, there is an error in production so R has

processes and pipelines in place for peer review.

A frequent issue which CT raised was that C was not uploading the code
he had created to a repository with sufficient frequency. This was referred
to as ‘pushing code’ or ‘committing’. R worked in this way so that the code
would be visible to the rest of the team and subject to a degree of review
and comments or suggestions from others about the approach taken. The
practice would also allow CT visibility of progress being made with the
projects team members were working on. The repository to which C was
required to ‘push’ was called GitHub. A Dev Ops Engineer was expected
to push code to a branch. It could then be peer reviewed and ultimately
merged into the ‘main branch’ which was a protected branch to go out to

production through the pipeline.

CT sent a number of text reminders on Teams to C to commit [his code].
She sent a message on 1 March 2023 asking C to put his work on GitHub
on a branch with a smiley face. She sent a further message on 27 April
2023: “Remember to push your work to branch [smiling emoji]”.

On 11 May 2023 during a team meeting, JW made comments about
another department. He said, ‘people are so fucking dumb in that

department.’

Around mid-May, there was a daily team meeting where C’s work was
discussed. There had been no further interactions between C and JW
which caused C concern since the occasion in February / March when JW
said C should not build a firewall.

C, CT, JW, G Dolan and a new colleague (name unknown) attended. C

was working on a project using AWS (Amazon Web Services). He had


--- New Page 15 ---
Page number: 15
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 15

passed an exam to be a certified solutions architect for AWS. He was firmly

of the view that the modular approach he was taking was best practice and

was the approach recommended by Amazon. This meant he was building

up the code for the project (using the Terraform coding language) in
5 discrete modules.

50. During the meeting, C explained what he was doing. JW said to him words
along the lines: ‘Oh no. This is not the way we’re doing this. Let me explain
to you...” JW indicated it was important to take a so-called ‘single file’
approach. C did not argue with JW or respond to his comments during the

10 meeting. C felt JW was condescending. JW did not intend to sound
condescending but he did feel strongly that the approach C was taking was
inappropriate in the context of R’s business. CT did not share C’s view of
JW’s conduct. Though she felt he was forthright in how he expressed
himself, she did not consider his conduct inappropriate or feel that she, as

15 manager, needed to intervene.

51. After the meeting, C had a conversation with CT about his methodology
on the project. CT repeated that C needed to give up on the modular
approach and to make sure that his configurations could go into a single

file.

20 52. On19 May 2023 CT and C had an exchange of messages on Teams. CT
said: “Please remember to push your local commits to git [thumbs up
emoji] it’s good practice to push at a minimum at the end of the day. If you
were off sick for example someone could pick up where you left off.” C
apologized in his text reply and acknowledged CT was right. He said “.../t

25 is just me and my silly habit of pushing only what appears to be best...”

53. Later that day he sent a message on Teams telling CT there was a folder
on the branch with an update to the Terraform configuration he was
working on. CT replied less than half an hour later:

Why? This should all be in one folder, it's all still in separate folders? It
30 should be along these lines as discussed

and please don't feel like anything has to be absolutely right [smiling emoji]
push frequently, get feedback when you need, ask questions - I'm forever
making commits that just say “typo” [laughing emoji]

54. On23 May 2023, C messaged CT in Teams and asked her to look at some
10 coding which he had screenshotted. He said it is just so that you have an
idea before | push this.”. This was a source of frustration to CT, though she
didn’t display her impatience to C. She did not wish to receive code
structures in this way. Her preferred practice was to view it once pushed
in GitHub since that platform allowed review and collaboration in a way
15 that sharing screenshots did not. CT replied:

“so there should only be one variables file and one outputs file — these are
going to be the same inputs and outputs across all VPCs — this is why
pushing to git helps — then | can pull the branch and look at the code and
discuss it rather than looking at some file names on a screenshot.”

20 55. C replied regarding the approach and ended with the words, “But in order
to make this easier, | am breaking down configs along these lines before
merging into a single folder.” CT replied:

“most of the variables will be in your files to start with anyway as it's not a

module so it's defined in the code

25 we don't need things isolated, | get the original idea - but we want to be
able to run a pipeline across them all - check for changes etc - no manual

running of anything”.

56. CT made further comments on the technicality of the task to which C
replied: “yes this is why | am breaking it down for each of them and then
30 use the broken down files to build a single configuration.” CT responded,

“ok [thumbs up emoji] just keep remembering to commit — doesn’t matter
if it’s not working or not ‘beautiful’ [smiling emoji] | was so used to working
alone that | had the habit too [smiling emoji] now | do tiny changes and

push all day [smiling emoji].”

C replied to the effect that he would push the “broken down” configurations

every day.

CT’s interactions on Teams Chat with C were peppered with smiley faces,
but she had developed significant concerns about C’s performance and
approach in the role. She did not raise these concerns with C either in her
calls with him or in the Teams Chat beyond gentle directions and
corrections of the kind reproduced above. Her managerial style was to

seek to avoid confrontation or difficult conversations.

Nevertheless, she had concerns that she had to ‘course correct’ C
regarding a task he was set to identify all AWS resources and add them to
R’s source control system. CT was concerned that C initially approached
this by trying to script to capture manual changes. The end goal of the task
as far as CT was concerned was to use the Terraform tool to automate the
creation of the infrastructure. She had messaged C and explained what
she wished. She decided the task was too open ended and reduced its
scope. C did not challenge CT or refuse to approach it in the matter that
CT had asked, though he felt strongly his own initial approach was
defensible.

CT was also frustrated that C then approached the task using the latest
version of the coding language. Although her original ‘ticket’ which
allocated the work did not specify the exact version to be used, she was
frustrated that C had reviewed R’s existing repository yet had decided to
use a more recent version. CT felt that, even without specifying it, it should
have been obvious to an experienced Dev Ops Engineer that they should
take account of the ‘prior body of art’ created by R and ensure the structure
and versioning was consistent throughout. CT asked C to change to the

previous version which had been in use.

CT’s direction at the time regarding the version was characteristically
gentle. C did not argue with CT or refuse to use the version subsequently

specified, though again he had firm views that his initial choice to use the
latest version was logical and defensible. It was not a debate which was
had at the time, and C agreed to proceed as CT directed.

CT also had a concern about the length of time C was taking on the project
allocated. She didn’t raise this with C at the time. C felt there were
justifiable reasons for the length of time taken having regard to the
complication of having to change the programming version and more
significantly to change his approach from a modular one to a single file
one. No debate was had on the question of C’s speed at the time because
CT didn’t raise it with him.

Although CT did not raise directly with C the various concerns she had
about his work, or otherwise reveal her exasperation to C, she was by May,
regularly discussing her concerns with her manager, DM. She told DM she
had been having conversations with C to try to guide him to the right path

and that other team members were also trying to assist him.

On 25 May 2023, DM escalated CT’s complaints about C and discussed
these with a senior manager, D Keenan. The two had a call in which they
discussed dismissing C. Following the call, DM sent a message to CT and
David Middleton (DMn), as follows:

Hey folks, off a call with Dave K.

We have made the decision to Under 23 months dismiss Marcel - he's not

worked out and we have no room for passengers right now.

DMn asked if they were good to start the conversation with the People
Team and CT then had a series of messages with DM and DMn that day.
These, so far as relevant, are reproduced below.

[25/05/ 2023 10: 38] CT

I've had chats with him to commit his work various times, That's [sic] what
he's attempted to do wasn't in line with what we were trying to do, so | tried
to be more explicit in what | was asking. | guess it's more of an overall
thing. I've had occasions where Zoe had discussed how to structure the
terraform but then he asks me after it, He [sic] seems to take it personally

was a module for bash - but that doesn't mean it's right — it’s not what we
should be doing — use the tools the way they're intended

we should need to guide him so much

Thanks Claire from an HR perspective we haven't had an explicit 1-2-1

[25/05/2023 11:03] CT

No I've not had an explicit 1-2-1 in that regard

... [CT then pastes in recent Teams Chat she had with C on 23 May 2023]
[25/05/2023 11:12] CT

As | said it's more of an overall thing, for his experience, we expected more
- sorta what | mentioned to you already. It's like he's at a junior level, and
| get not understanding Ansible or Terraform, and things taking a bit longer
- but everything seems to be so long and just the though [sic] process
around things seems old, even just the basics like pushing to git...

[25/05/2023 11:16] CT

The whole thing makes me feel bad - he's such a nice guy and the start he
had was terrible with the incident but where do you stop - | don't think |

could trust him to do BAU [Business As Usual, meaning routine tasks].

This is the kicker:

[pastes in excerpt from C’s CV skills section and highlights part that says
“. Dev Ops — (Git, Ansible, Nagios, Jenkins, Gradle, Maven, Terraform)”]

66. On 12 June 2023, CT sent a document to Emma Glass, Senior People
Operations Manager, attaching a document setting out concerns about C.
That document had been prepared in part by DMn who wrote the first
section, and in part by CT, who wrote the second part in which she set out
examples of C’s work where she had concerns. In DMn’s section he
summarised concerns about C including his failure to commit code
frequently and a concern that C’s competencies with Terraform and

Ansible were limited. He ended his initial section:


--- New Page 21 ---
Page number: 21
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 21

“Given the above we believe there isn't a role for Marcel in the department
given the natural way Marcel likes to work and his level of exposure to the
tools we use. Marcel was brought in as an experienced senior engineer
and as such we would expect him to take autonomous ownership of some

5 of the tasks of the team. Given our time with Marcel to date we don't believe
that is going to be possible.”

67. CT’s section then listed her concerns about C’s approach to his current
task of identifying all AWS resources and adding them to source control.

These were, essentially the concerns that have been described in previous

10 paragraphs. She referred to the input of C’s colleague Zoe in relation to

reviewing the work at one stage, as follows:

Marcel had another attempt to restructure his work and then paired with
his colleague Zoe to review it. Zoe highlighted issues with the structure,
the version being used and how the state file worked (that we did not want

15 them individual)

Following that Marcel then called me, questioning what Zoe had said. |
reiterated that she was correct - and this is what | had previously explained
that we wanted a single VPC folder with them all in it.

Having explained on calls and in the chat the folder structure that was
20 expected... | was still met with having to go over it yet again on our catch

up - that the settings were to remain in the file and not in the variables file.

Throughout this as previously mentioned, I've had to remind him to push
changes to GitHub, not to send screenshots when asking me to assist,
25 these are just reminders in chat, others were issued verbally.

Commits were infrequent and often one or two lines or words were
changed in a period of a few days - the work rate is below what | would

expect, even from my graduate or apprentice.

30 68. AsCT sawit, C’s performance issues having been escalated to HR, it was
for HR and DMn to take forward and she did not take further involvement


--- New Page 22 ---
Page number: 22
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 22

in that process, other than to respond to queries from HR when they were
made. R routinely operated a practice whereby HR Team members rather
than line employees’ managers chaired and took decisions in relation to
the outcomes of processes of the sort R then pursued in relation to C which
5 was referred to as a ‘continued employment meeting’. ‘Continued
Employment Meetings’ was the (somewhat misleading) name given to the
meetings R held with employees with less than 23 months’ service about
whom management had raised performance concerns. This practice of HR
leading the process and deciding outcomes was in place across R’s
10 business; it was not unique to C’s case. CT understood a meeting would
be held with C, chaired by a member of HR and DMn. DMn had an

understanding of the technical aspects of the DevOps Engineer role.

69. CT met with C on 13 June 2023 about work matters. Although she knew a
process was shortly to be progressed by HR, she did not discuss this with
15 C. She did not raise with C the performance issues she had raised with
DM, DMn and the People Team. She did not give him any warning that his
performance required to improve. She discussed the current work and
talked about future work to be allocated to C. The tone of the meeting gave
no reason for C to fear his performance was of concern. CT was
20 inexperienced at managing poor performance with her team members and
reluctant to do so. She had never had a 1-2-1 with C or any other team
member where she had warned them about their performance or otherwise
made it clear she was dissatisfied with their work. In C’s case at least, CT

regarded this as something to be done by others.

25 70. Following that meeting with C, CT did not misrepresent the discussions
that took place to LC, DM or DMn. She did not suggest to these individuals
or to anyone else that she had given C a warning during that meeting. She
did not tell HR that she had used the meeting to raise concerns with C
about his performance.

30 71. On14 June 2023, LC, People Adviser, emailed C a letter inviting him to a
meeting to discuss his continued employment with R. The meeting was to
take place on 20 June 2023, in-person, in Hillington and the invite
confirmed that she and DMn would be present. The letter ended with the
following paragraph:

termination of your employment therefore may | remind you that you are
entitled to be accompanied by a work colleague or any accredited trade

assistance in making arrangements.
C was shocked and upset to receive the email.

On 19 June 2023, C sent an email to LC and DMn. He cc’d in DM and CT.
His email was of significant length. When printed to be produced to the ET,
it ran to five pages of tight text. C expressed his shock in the email. He
gave considerable detail about the tasks which he had been allocated
during his employment and the approach he had taken. He embedded
links to coding which he had worked on. The email did not expressly ask
that DM (or any other recipient) check the code linked within it. DM did not
do so. He did not understand that C was requesting him to do so.

In the email, C also referred to his qualifications and experience. The
position C took was, in essence, that his approach and performance were
strong that that his output was acceptable in the circumstances. He argued
he had carried out the tasks successfully and explained he considered his
approach was preferable to that which he had been steered to take by CT,
JW and others. He gave detailed explanations of the reasons for the route
he had taken. He nonetheless noted he had changed direction when asked
to do so. With respect to his latest task, he observed that CT seemed
satisfied that they were now approaching the end of the road with it and
that she had even suggested to him what the next step would be when the
present stage was complete.

C’s email of 19 June 2023 included the following excerpts, so far as

relevant:

In light of the cyberattack our company suffered in December and in the
name of the basic principles of digital security hygiene, it is not right to
copy the passwords from an old server when rebuilding a server in a
company setting and even more so right after a horrible cyberattack.
Instead, a dutiful devops engineer should use a secure method to reset all

the passwords on the new server and this is what | had in mind as a matter
of dutiful care towards the interest of my employer.

But the story does not end there: despite the violence with which | was
treated and in spite of the fact that copying over old passwords to new
servers in an environment which had suffered a recent attack was clearly
wrong and not in the best interest of the company in my modest opinion, |
nonetheless accepted the verdict and went ahead to implement the
solution of Mr White.

3/ The interaction to date with my direct manager

So taken into account the fact that | never got direct complaints or warning

from my manager... you can now imagine... the extent of my surprise...

The only thing | can remember that might have triggered this was at the
end of the discussion last week when she asked me if | had had the help
of Mr White for the then ongoing merging process. | responded that |
hadn't... | must say that | am not too fond of getting anywhere near Mr
White as he is most likely the most verbally abusive, brutal, loud and
disrespectful person | ever came across and | once complained about him

and his absolutely terrible manners to my direct manager.

Between his never ending rather vulgar insults, during team meetings,
about the other teams who are always systematically qualified after the
use of, you will excuse me, the “F” word, his total lack of respect for
everyone including our manager whom he would systematically interrupt
during team meetings to my disbelief to this day, the fact that he once
allowed himself to shush her in front of everyone, his systematic attempts
to belittle me in particular and some of his comments about my direct
manager during one of our meetings, | developed and you would
understand an attitude of total avoidance. | know that my direct manager

is valid very tolerant but the issue is that by being too tolerant of his

excessive behaviour, it is not only reinforcing them but leading to an

atmosphere | personally consider rather toxic and discouraging.

Also and | would like to emphasise that, | have never had any problems |
can remember of with my manager Mrs Thomson whom | appreciate both

as a manager and a person of very good character.

Also finally, with my constant effort to be not only mindful but respectful of
the interest of the company, my attempt to apply the generally admitted
rules for the task required of me, the fact that the goals set for me were not
a failure and my real respect for my manager from whom | never received
a warning from my work, | think it is extremely unfair for me to be in this
situation now. Also we have and | have detailed it above some characters
in the team with an attitude that would guarantee in other settings, an
immediate dismissal for gross misconduct; but these characters are
instead left in peace when they terrorise everyone around them with open

brutality and verbal abuse and this is not right to me.

76. On 20 June 2023, C attended the meeting with LC and DMn. The meeting
that day lasted around 3 hours or more and was ultimately adjourned
because of the late hour. During that meeting, C explained in detail the
technicality of his approach and why he considered it to be optimal. He
explained his reasons for adopting a modular approach. He explained that,
so far as the frequency of commits to GitHub was concerned, pushing
every two hours was not feasible because of the complexity of reassessing
the variable to put what he had initially written in a modular fashion into a
single folder. DMn suggested that R would be expecting code to be pushed
around 5 or 6 times per day. C said because of the mental analysis
required to undertake the task pushing with such frequency was not
practicable but that he was neither stupid nor lazy and that the code was

there and was working.

77. C pointed out he had written more than 1000 lines of code in a few days

which was working and which he said very few people would be able to

manage. During the meeting, C refuted that he was in any way deficient in
Ansible and pointed out he had not refused to do anything asked of him.

DMn summarized at one point during the meeting the situation as follows:
“...fundamentally what the team were saying was you weren't following the

strategy of the team and your position is that it wasn't right.”

On 20 June, following the meeting, LC emailed CT to ask her a series of
questions arising from points C had made. CT responded by email on 21
June with answers to the queries and screenshot examples to illustrate her
views. The queries and responses concerned the technical issues raised
by C about the tasks. CT maintained her concerns about the approach
taken by C in her responses.

On 22 June 2023, the ‘continued employment meeting’ with C resumed.
Once again, it was chaired by LC and DMn was also present. LC outlined
the detail of some of CT’s concerns. C was given the opportunity to
respond and did so. LC adjourned the meeting when matters had been
discussed in detail. When the meeting reconvened, LC told C that C had
failed to follow instructions, that there were concerns about his overall
performance, and that she had decided to dismiss him.

On 22 June 2023, LC wrote to C confirming the dismissal with effect from
22 June 2023 on payment in lieu of 4 weeks’ notice. Her letter said:

. | write to inform you that your contract of employment... will be
terminated with immediate effect due to your overall capability within your
role as DevOps Engineer specifically in relation to your failure to perform
tasks in a timely manner, to utilise our systems efficiently and to perform
the tasks expected in your role to the standards expected.”

On the same date, at 4.39 pm, LC informed her colleagues in payroll of the
dismissal and they proceeded to process C’s departure from R for pay and
benefit purposes. That included informing AXA Health of C’s departure to
cancel C’s access to the health care scheme. AXA issued a letter on 31
August 2023 confirming to C that his access had ended on 21 June 2023.
AXA had not been informed by payroll of the cancellation on 21 June 2023.

R’s payroll informed AXA of the cancellation on or after 22 June 2023 but

Page number: 27
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 27

AXA cancelled the policy with retrospective effect from 21 June 2023. This
retrospective approach was in line with a policy of R and / or AXA that
employees should be precluded from submitting a claim for the benefit on

their final day of employment.

5 83. After his dismissal, C did some analysis of the relevant GitHub repository
logs. From his analysis, he identified that no one in his team was pushing
code as frequently as five times per day as DMn had suggested would be
expected. This analysis of the logs had not been presented to R prior to
dismissing C. He analysed the commits in the period from 5 December

10 2022 to 22 June 2023 and calculated that, across that period, he did on
average 0.38 commits per day. His analysis demonstrated he was not the
least frequent to push in the team in the period. Greg Dolan and CT
committed code less frequently to the repository across the same period.
G Dolan was deployed at times in this period on other work which did not

15 entail committing code to GitHub. At the start of the year, Mr Dolan was
working with the Cyber Team and other squads investigating databases.
JW committed most frequently (on average 4.41 times per day). Zoe
Mackie also committed more frequently than C.

Observations on the evidence

20 84. Asthe evidence transpired at the hearing, there was surprisingly little fatual
dispute between the parties. The distance between C and R evidentially
was far smaller than might have been anticipated based on their pleadings.
C’s evidence in Tribunal differed to his amended pleaded case in a number

of respects, bringing it much closer to the account given by R’s witnesses.

25 85. The later events in June 2023 were substantially documented and in
relation to most of them, there was no factual dispute. The correspondence
in June 2023 were agreed; the content of the meeting between C and CT
on 13 June 2023 was not materially disputed; the content of the two
meetings between C and DMn and LC on 20 and 22 June was set out

30 extensively in notes that were verbatim or close to verbatim.

86. C’s account in the witness box of his interactions with JW in the period
from January to June 2023 was markedly different to the facts averred in
his amended ET1. The occasions complained of by C involving conduct

88.

directed at him by JW were less frequent than his pleaded case might
suggest. He gave evidence of three such interactions. When encouraged
to recall the actual words used, C recounted the encounters in much more
moderate terms than the adjectives used in his pleadings to describe them.
He was candid about not being able to recall the precise words used.
Likewise, his evidence of what exactly he said to CT on 12 January 2024
was not as averred in his pleadings.

JW generally had a poor memory of any of the encounters which did not
stand out for him. CT, who was also present on each occasion, recalled
the exchanges with some relatively small differences between her
recollection and C’s about the nature of the interactions. On the whole we
preferred CT’s account in relation to those relatively small differences. C
couldn’t recall the specifics of the words used and his account was
undermined somewhat by the significant inconsistencies as between his
evidence and his pleaded case. The evidential differences between the
parties were relatively minor. We accepted the evidence of JW and CT that
in the January incident JW did not tell C to shut up or to keep quiet as C
claimed. We accepted he did, however, fend off comment from C by saying
“I’m speaking” or similar. We accepted that in the February / March
incident, JW did not shout the words that they would not instal a firewall

(as C said) but that he did say these words firmly and sternly.

The principal dispute lay in the interpretation of words and events. C, when
encouraged to recall the actual words and tone used in the incident, did so
as best he could. We do not find he deliberately sought to mislead the
Tribunal on these individual interractions, albeit that at times his
recollection was not wholly reliable. A striking feature of the evidence,
however, was that we observed a notable difference when C characterised
the incidents generally or referred to them in an evaluative way, as
opposed to recounting the specifics. Here, he was inclined to using emotive
and extravagant language, regularly describing JW as ‘violent’ and
‘abusive’ among other adjectives. This echoed his approach in his email of
19 June 2023 and in his pleadings. C’s reaction to JW’s critical comments
on his work was one of considerable offence and outrage.

The other striking feature of the evidence was C’s focus on persuading us
of the superiority of his favoured modular approach to the coding task over
the single file approach advocated by R. He took a smilar approach when
advocating for himself during his June meetings with R and in his email of
19 June. While we heard some evidence from C (and from CT) on this
matter, we required to manage the hearing so as to ensure that this was
kept within proportionate parameters. We explained we were unlikely to
come to any finding in fact about which was the optimal coding practice
(assuming indeed that there is an objectively ‘correct’ answer) and we have
not done so. We did not consider it necessary or of particular assistance in
deciding the issues before us.

Relevant Law

Whistleblowing: what disclosures qualify for protection?

90.

Section 43B of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (“ERA”) sets out 6

categories of qualifying disclosure.

(1) — In this Part a “qualifying disclosure” means any disclosure of
information which, in the reasonable belief of the worker making the
disclosure, is made in the public interest and tends to show one or
more of the following—

(a) that a criminal offence has been committed, is being
committed or Is likely to be committed,

(b) _ that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply
with any legal obligation to which he is subject,

(c) that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is

likely to occur,

(d) — that the health or safety of any individual has been, is being

or Is likely to be endangered,

(e) that the environment has been, is being or Is likely to be
damaged, or

8000485/2023 Page 30

(f) that information tending to show any matter falling within any
one of the preceding paragraphs has been, or is likely to be
deliberately concealed.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), it is immaterial whether the
5 relevant failure occurred, occurs or would occur in the United

Kingdom or elsewhere,

91. In the case of Cavendish Munro Professional Risks Management
Limited v Geduld 2010 ICR 325, the EAT held that to be a disclosure of
information, it must contain facts rather than simply make an allegation. As

10 long as the worker ‘reasonably believes’ that the information tends to show
one of the matters required in section 43B(1), the disclosure will be

qualified even if the information turns out to be untrue or inaccurate.

92. In the case of Soh v Imperial College of Science Technology and
Medicine EAT 0350/14 it was confirmed that there was a distinction
15 between the worker saying “I believe X is true ” and “I believe that this
information tends to show that X is true” . It may be impossible for a worker
to assess whether information from a third party is true or not. As long as
the worker ‘reasonably believes’ that the information tends to show one of
the matters required in section 43B (1), the disclosure will qualify even if
20 the information turns out to be untrue or inaccurate. In Kraus v Penna PLC
and anor 2004 IRLR 260 EAT said that ‘likely’ should be construed as
‘requiring more than a possibility, or a risk, that an employer (or other
person) might fail to comply with the relevant legal obligation.

Whistleblowing: automatic unfair dismissal under section 103A of ERA

25 93. Employees may claim a dismissal is automatically unfair if the reason or
principal reason for the dismissal is that they made a protected disclosure.
The relevant provision is section 103A of ERA which is in the following

terms:
103A Protected disclosure

30 An employee who is dismissed shall be regarded for the purposes of this
Part as unfairly dismissed if the reason (or, if more than one, the principal
reason) for the dismissal is that the employee made a protected disclosure

Page number: 31
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 31

94. The question of whether the principal reason for dismissal was a protected
disclosure is a question of fact for the Tribunal. Where multiple disclosures
are made, the approach is to ask whether the disclosures, taken as a
whole, were the principal reason for dismissal (El-Megrisi v Azad
5 University (IR) in Oxford [2009] UKEAT 0448/08/0505).

95. ‘If the employee does not have 2 years’ service, the burden of showing, on
the balance of probabilities, that the reason for dismissal was an
automatically unfair one rests with the claimant (Ross v Eddie Stobart
Ltd UKEAT/0068/13/RN).

10 96. A Tribunal must ask two questions:
i. firstly, what is the reason for the dismissal? and

il. secondly, (if it was because of a disclosure or disclosures),

were those disclosures protected?

97. It was confirmed in Croydon Health Services NHS Trust v Beatt [2017]

15 ICR 1240 CA that the first question requires the Tribunal to consider what
facts or beliefs caused the decision maker to dismiss. The second question

about whether the disclosure is protected is a matter of objective
determination by the Tribunal and the belief of the decision maker is

irrelevant.
20  Whistleblowing: right not to suffer a detriment

98. The right not to suffer a detriment on the ground of having made a
protected disclosure is set out in section 47B of ERA as follows:

(1) A worker has the right not to be subjected to any detriment by any
act, or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer done on the
25 ground that the worker has made a protected disclosure.

(2)... This section does not apply where—
(a) the worker is an employee, and

(b) the detriment in question amounts to dismissal (within the
30 meaning of Part X).

99.

100.

(3) For the purposes of this section, and of sections 48 and 49 so far
as relating to this section, “worker”, “worker's contract ”,
“employment ” and “ employer ” have the extended meaning given

by section 43K.

The term detriment is not defined in ERA. Interpretive assistance is
available from discrimination law. See paragraph 111 below for information
regarding what constitutes a detriment in that context.

It is not sufficient to demonstrate that, "but for" the protected disclosure,
the detriment would not have taken place. The test is similar to the
"because of" test used in direct discrimination cases, except that there is
no statutory requirement for a comparator. (See paragraph 107 below on

the test of causation in direct discrimination and victimisation cases.)

Harassment related to race (s.26 EA)

101.

Section 26 of EA deals with harassment and is in the following terms, so

far as material:
26 Harassment
(1) A person A harasses another (B) if —

(a) A engages in unwanted conduct related to a relevant
protected characteristic, and

(b) the conduct has the purpose or effect of —
(i) violating B’s dignity, or

(il) creating an_ intimidating, hostile, degrading,

humiliating or offensive environment for B.

(4) In deciding whether conduct has the effect referred to in subsection
(1)(b) each of the following must be taken into account —

(a) the perception of B;

(b) the other circumstances of the case;

25

8000485/2023 Page 33

(c) whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have that effect.

102. Section 136 of EA deals with the burden of proof. It is set out in full below
under the heading ‘Burden of Proof (EA claims)’, where the provisions are
discussed. Although the provisions are most commonly invoked in relation
to direct discrimination complaints, they are equally applicable to

harassment and victimisation complaints.
Victimisation

103. Section 27 EA is concerned with victimisation and provides, so far as

material, as follows:
“27 Victimisation

(1) | A person (A) victimises another person (B) if A subjects B to a

detriment because —

(a) B does a protected act, or

(b) A believes that B has done, or may do, a protected act.
(2) Each of the following is a protected act—

(a) bringing proceedings under this Act;

(b) giving evidence or information in connection with

proceedings under this Act;

(c) doing any other thing for the purposes of or in connection
with this Act;

(d) making an allegation (whether or not express) that A or
another person has contravened this Act.

(3) Giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation,
is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the

allegation is made, in bad faith.

(4) This section applies only where the person subjected to a detriment

is an individual.


--- New Page 34 ---
Page number: 34
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 34

(4) This section applies only where the person subjected to a detriment

is an individual.”

104. For discussion on the meaning of ‘a detriment’, see paragraph 111 below.
5 The detriment must be 'because' of the protected act. The protected act

must be 'the reason’ for the treatment.
Direct discrimination

105. Section 13 of the EA is concerned with direct discrimination and provides

as follows:
10 “13 Direct discrimination

(1) | A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a
protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or
would treat others.”

106. Section 9 EA deals with the protected characteristic of race. It provides:
15 “9 Race
Race includes
(a) colour
(b) nationality;
(c) ethnic or national origins.”

20 107. According to section 23 EA, “on a comparison for the purposes of section
13, ... there must be no material difference between the circumstances
relating to each case”. The relevant “circumstances” are those factors
which the respondent has taken into account in deciding to treat the
claimant as it did, with the exception of the element of race (Shamoon v

25 Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [2003] UKHL 11). A
person can be an appropriate comparator even if the situations compared
are not precisely the same (Hewage v Grampian Health Board [2012]
UKSC 37). The claimant does not need to point to an actual comparator at
all and may rely only on a hypothetical comparison.


--- New Page 35 ---
Page number: 35
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 35

108. Very little direct discrimination today is overt, and it can be necessary to
look for indicators from a time before or after a particular decision which
may demonstrate that an ostensibly fair-minded decision was, or equally
was not, affected by racial bias (Anya v University of Oxford [2001] IRLT

5 377, CA). Sometimes evidence is led of so-called ‘evidential comparators’.
These are actual comparators but whose material circumstances in some
way differ from those of the claimant. Their evidential value is variable and
is inevitably weakened by differences in material circumstances from the

claimant’s (Shamoon).

10 109. For adirect race discrimination complaint to succeed, it must be found that
any less favourable treatment was because of the claimant’s race, though
the discriminatory reason need not be the sole or even the principal reason
for the respondent’s treatment. In JP Morgan Europe Ltd v Chweidan
[2011] IRLR 673, CA, LJ Elias summarised the position as follows:

15 “5... This means that a reason for the less favourable treatment — not
necessarily the only reason but one which is significant in the sense
of more than trivial - must be the claimant’s disability. ...”

110. Section 39(2) of EA provides among other matters that an employer must

not discriminate against an employee as to the terms on which

20 employment is offered or the way in which he affords access to training or
other benefits, or by dismissing him or subjecting him to ‘any other

detriment’. There is, therefore, a requirement for an element of detriment

in any discrimination claim (which does not concern terms of employment,

access to benefits or dismissal).

25 111. ‘Detriment’ is not defined in the legislation, save that it is said to exclude
conduct amounting to harassment (s.212). A claimant seeking to establish
a ‘detriment’ needs to show that a reasonable employee would or might
take the view that they had been disadvantaged in the circumstances in
which they had to work (Shamoon v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster
30 Constabulary (Northern Ireland) [2003] UKHL 11. The dicta of Peter
Gibson LJ in Jiad v Byford [2003] IRLR 232), CA is that ‘detriment’ is to
be given a wide meaning and it means no more than to put under a

disadvantage. Although a trivial disadvantage would not suffice, it is not

necessary to find some physical or economic consequence. ACAS
describes detriment as describing ‘damage, harm or loss’.

Burden of Proof (EA claims)

112.

113.

114.

Section 136 of EA deals with the burden of proof. It provides, so far as

material, as follows:
“136 Burden of proof

(1) This section applies to any proceedings relating to a contravention
of this Act.

(2) If there are facts from which the court could decide, in the absence
of any other explanation, that a person (A) contravened the
provision concerned, the court must hold that the contravention

occurred.

(3) But subsection (2) does not apply if A shows that A did not

contravene the provision.

(6) A reference to the court includes a reference to—

(a) | anemployment tribunal;

y

The effect of section 136 is that, if the claimant makes out a prima facie
case of discrimination (or harassment or victimisation), it will be for the

respondent to show a non-discriminatory explanation.

There are two stages. Under Stage 1, the claimant must show facts from
which the Tribunal could decide there was discrimination (or harassment
or victimisation). This means a ‘reasonable tribunal could properly
conclude’ on the balance of probabilities that there was discrimination or
harassment (Madarassy v Nomura International ple [2007] IRLR 246,
CA). The Tribunal should take into account all facts and evidence available
to it at Stage 1, not only those which the claimant has adduced or proved.
If there are disputed facts, the burden of proof is on the claimant to prove
those facts. The respondent’s explanation is to be left out of account in

8000485/2023 Page 37

applying Stage 1. However, merely showing a protected characteristic plus
less favourable treatment is not generally sufficient to shift the burden and
progress to Stage 2. Those bare facts only indicate a possibility of
discrimination. They are not, without more, sufficient material from which
a tribunal could conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, the
respondent had committed un unlawful act of discrimination or other

prohibited conduct. ‘Something more’ is required (Madarassy).

115. Although, at Stage 1, a tribunal must exclude the substance of the
employer's explanation, it is not excluded from drawing inferences from
the fact that there are inconsistencies in an employer’s explanation (Veolia
Environmental Services UK v Gumbs EAT/0487/12/BA).

116. If the claimant shows facts from which the Tribunal could decide a
discriminatory or other prohibited act has occurred, then, under Stage 2,
the respondent must prove on the balance of probabilities that the
treatment was ‘in no sense whatsoever’ because of the protected

characteristic or protected act (Igen v Wong [2005] IRLR 258).

117. There are cases where it is unnecessary to apply the burden of proof
provisions. These provisions will require careful attention where there is
room for doubt as to the facts necessary to prove discrimination or other
prohibited conduct but they have nothing to offer where the Tribunal is in
a position to make positive findings one way or the other (Hewage).

Sections 39 and 40 of EA (Discrimination and Harassment at Work)
118. Section 39 of the EA, so far as relevant, is in the following terms:

39. | Employees and applicants

(1)

(2) An employer (A) must not discriminate against an employee of A's
(B)—
(a)

(dq) by subjecting B to any other detriment.

119. Section 40 of the EA, so far as relevant, provides:

(1) | Anemployer (A) must not, in relation to employment by A,
harass a person (B)—

(a) who is an employee of A's;

Submissions

120. Mr Meechan spoke to a written submission to which he faithfully adhered.
The claimant gave an oral submission. The entire content of both
submissions has been carefully considered and taken into account in
making the decisions in this judgment. Failure to mention any part of these
submissions in this judgment does not reflecttheir lack of
consideration. The submissions are addressed in the ‘Discussion and
Decision’ section below, which sets out where the submissions were

accepted, where they are not, and the reasons for this.
Discussion and Decision
Whistleblowing: Did C make protected disclosures?

121. Did C make the disclosures set out at paragraphs 9 (i), (ii) and (iii) above
and were they protected disclosures?

12 January 2023 alleged PD (1) — complaint about JW

122. C’s claim is that on this date he told CT that the way in which JW had
spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was
contributing to insecurity in the department and was having an effect on

his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

123. In his submissions, C said that having an individual allowed to terrorize
others verbally put health and safety at risk. He referred to his evidence
about JW’s behaviour. He said everything was written in plain English on


--- New Page 39 ---
Page number: 39
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 39

19 June. It was, said C, not necessary to explicitly say something illegal
was happening. Mr Meechan summarised the law on qualifying protected
disclosures. He submitted that C didn’t make the disclosures in the way
alleged in his pleaded case and the information neither expressly nor

5 impliedly tended to show breach of a legal obligation or risk to health and
safety. Further, Mr Meechan argued that any belief that the disclosures
were in the public interest was not objectively reasonable.

124. With respect to the alleged protected disclosure on 12 January, we have
not found that C used the words averred in his amended claim. It was not
10 C’s evidence to the Tribunal that he did so. We have found instead that he
told CT the way JW spoke to him unacceptable. C did not use the words
‘violent’ or ‘abusive’ though he did say he found JW to be condescending
and insulting. We have found that he did not say JW was contributing to
insecurity in the department or having an effect on C’s health and safety
15 and that of the whole team.

125. We considered whether, in the words we found he uttered, C disclosed
information which in his reasonable belief tended to show that a person
had failed, was failing or was likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation
or that the health and safety of an individual had been, was being or was

20 likely to be endangered. We do not accept that C believed telling CT that
he found JW’s behaviour unacceptable and his language insulting and
condesceding tended to show the circumstances mentioned (or any other
relevant circumstances listed in s.43B(1) of ERA). Support for that finding
is available from the Teams chat which followed between C and CT where

25 C said “so let’s just forget about that discussion we had this afternoon ...
as | was not aware of these challenges.” Had C genuinely believed that his
disclosure tended to show endangerment or a likely legal breach, it seems
unlikely he would so readily have asked that the matter be forgotten about
regardless of CT’s explanation about JW’s ADHD.

30 126. Even if he did hold such a belief, it would not be objectively reasonable to
do so. C did not refer to his health or that of anyone else during his
discussion with CT. He did not allege any legal breach either expressly or
impliedly. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to go on to consider
whether C reasonably believed his disclosure was in the public interest.

8000485/2023 Page 40

However, had we required to decide this, we would have found that he did
not. We do not accept he entertained such a belief as a matter of fact, but,
even if he did so, such belief would not have been an objectively
reasonable one for him to hold based on the information he conveyed to
CT on 12 January. This information affected only him and arguably CT
herself as the only other participants in the call.

12 January 2023 alleged PD (2) — Complaint about copying passwords

127. C did not address us in his submissions on the alleged protected
disclosure concerning the copying of passwords in the context of his
submission on whistleblowing. Mr Meechan submitted that C did not
expressly or impliedly referred to any legal obligation being breached in
his conversation with CT.

128. We have found as a matter of fact that C raised with CT the practice of
copying old passwords to the new server but that he did not tell her the
action of JW in doing so was contrary to R’s legal obligations following a
cyber security breach. Again, it was not C’s evidence at the hearing that
he did so.

129. Weconsidered whether, on the facts found, C disclosed information which
in his reasonable belief tended to show that a person had failed, was failing
or was likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation. We accept he
disclosed factual information (the practice of copying passwords from one
server to another) for the purposes of Cavendish. However, we do not
accept that C believed voicing his concerns about this tended to show the
circumstances mentioned (or any other relevant circumstances listed in
s.43B(1) of ERA). As Mr Meechan pointed out, C didn’t refer to any legal
obligations expressly or impliedly. Again, some support for C’s lack of
belief might be derived from his own willingness to accept CT’s contrary
view without argument and to continue with the approach she proposed.
When she pointed out the passwords were encrypted and were not
captured by the cyber breach because the particular server was not live,
C went along with her approach and direction. It is unlikely he would so
readily have acceded to the approach if he genuinely believed that he had
conveyed information tending to show R’s breach of a legal obligation.

130.

In any event, even if C did hold such a belief, it would not be objectively
reasonable to do so. He referred to no legislation or or other laws or even
guidance during the discussion. There is no objectively reasonable basis
for a belief that the information he shared tended to show breach of a legal
obligation or the likelihood of one.

19 June 2023 — alleged PD (3) verbal abuse by JW and IT malpractice

131.

132.

133.

C said that his email of 19 June was written in plain English and that it was
hard to demonstrate that these logical conclusions (endangerment to H&S
and a legal breach) did not flow from what he wrote. For something to be
illegal, it did not been to be explicitly said, in C’s submission. He also relied
on the text of the email as tending to show a risk to health and safety. Mr
Meechan, on the other hand, said there was no mention of legal obligations
and that the reference to ‘digital security hygiene’ was a very different
issue, more akin to a recommendation of best practice. With regard to the
email content about JW, Mr Meechan adopted the same points as he had
in relation to the first alleged protected disclosure.

With regard to IT malpractice, C said this in his email:

“...It is not right to copy the passwords from an old server when rebuilding
a server in a company setting and even more so right after a horrible
cyberattack. Instead, a dutiful devops engineer should use a secure
method to reset all the passwords on the new server and this is what | had
in mind as a matter of dutiful care towards the interest of my employer.

... In spite of the fact that copying over old passwords to new servers in an
environment which had suffered a recent attack was clearly wrong and not
in the best interest of the company in my modest opinion, | nonetheless
accepted the veraict.”

We accept that again there is a disclosure of information about a practice
of copying passwords from an old server. We considered whether, in his
reasonable belief, this information tended to show that a person had failed,
was failing or was likely to fail to comply with a legal obligation. We
concluded that C did not subjectively hold this belief at the time, but that,

134.

135.

even if he did so, such belief was not objectively reasonable. C makes no
reference in his email to any legal obligation either expressly or by
implication. On the contrary, he refers to his preferred approach as being
what a ‘dutiful’ devops engineer should do. It was, he said, a matter of
dutiful care towards the interests of his employer and not in R’s best
interests. His criticism at its highest is that the practice is “wrong” in C’s
own opinion. His email cannot be read as supporting an objectively
reasonabe belief that he was disclosing information tending to show that
R was falling foul of a legal obligation.

With regard to verbal abuse by JW, C’s email of 19 June included the

following relevant text:

despite the violence with which | was treated

... lam not too fond of getting anywhere near Mr White as he is most likely
the most verbally abusive, brutal, loud and disrespectful person | ever

came across...

Between his never ending rather vulgar insults, ... about the other teams
who are always systematically qualified after the use of... the “F” word, his
total lack of respect for everyone including our manager whom he would
systematically interrupt during team meetings ..., the fact that he once
allowed himself to shush her ..., his systematic attempts to belittle me in

particular and some of his comments about my direct manager

...by being too tolerant of his excessive behaviour, it is not only reinforcing
them but leading to an atmosphere | personally consider rather toxic and

discouraging.

...| have detailed it above some characters in the team with an attitude that
would guarantee in other settings, an immediate dismissal for gross
misconduct; but these characters are instead left in peace when they
terrorise everyone around them with open brutality and verbal abuse and

this is not right to me.

We accept that C’s email disclosed some information about JW and some
of his behaviour. There was some factual content conveyed about JW


--- New Page 43 ---
Page number: 43
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 43

using the f word about other teams, as well as interrupting and shushing
his manager, and belittling C. In his email, C also deploys emotive
language which is not tied to a specific factual allegation, describing JW

as “violent”, “abusive”, “brutal” and ‘terrorising’.

5 136. In different circumstances, such potent language might be reasonably
believed by a worker to tend to show that some act of physical violence
had occurred or was likely to occur. Were that the case, the requirements
of section 43B(1) would most likely be satisfied . However, C did not
believe that his emotive words tended to show such a situation. He was

10 not alleging physical violence or intimidation by JW and did not believe his
words disclosed information tending to show this. He had minimal in-
person interactions with JW as both individuals were remote workers, and
he knew the email recipients understood this. The array of adjectives was
intended to refer to the behaviour of JW mentioned in the email which was

15 restricted to verbal interactions.

137. Notwithstanding the immoderate language used in relation to JW, the
factual information disclosed, we find, was not believed by C to tend to
show either a breach of a legal obligation or the endangerment of health
and safety. C does not expressly refer to either risk in his email and we do

20 not accept he believed such a situation was implied by his description of
the bad language, interruptions and other conduct in the email. If he did
so, such belief would not be objectively reasonable when one focuses on
the factual information conveyed about JW’s conduct, rather than the

emotive adjectives.

25 138. Again, we do not require to do so, but if we were to consider whether C
reasonably believed his disclosures were in the public interest, we would
conclude he did not. JW was a colleague at the same level as C. He
worked from home and he did not, in the scheme of the respondent's
international structure, have a particularly high office in relative terms or a

30 wide sphere of influence or interaction organisationally. This was a clash
of communication styles and sensibilities, but was a contained matter in
the sense that, at most, it affected perhaps 5 or 6 people in R’s ArchOps
team. C was also aware when he wrote his email that any ‘wrongdoing’ by
JW may be contributed to by his ADHD. We don’t accept that C believed

subjectively that he was disclosing information about JW in the interests of
a wider public. In all the circumstances, it would not be objectively
reasonable for him to hold such a belief, even if he did so.

139. We therefore find that C did not make protected disclosures to R as alleged
or at all. It follows that C’s complaint of automatic unfair dismissal pursuant
to section 103A of ERA is dismissed. So too is his protected disclosure
detriment complaint brought puruant to s.47B of that Act.

Victimisation
Alleged Protected Act (1) — Communications with CT on 12 January 2023

140. C alleges that his complaints made to CT on 12 January 2023 about JW’s
conduct amounted to a protected act. As discussed above in the context
of C’s whistleblowing complaints, we have not found that C said the things
which were pleaded in his amended claim. We found he told CT the way
JW spoke to him unacceptable and that he found JW to be condescending

and insulting.

141. C’s submissions on victimisation were not focused on whether his actings
met the definition of a protected act but on his assertion that there was a
causal link between his complaint about JW and his dismissal. Mr
Meechan summarised the legislative provisions on victimisation and cited
the case of Beneviste v Kingston University EAT 039/05 in which the
EAT commented that a claim does not identify a protected act in the true
legal sense ‘merely by making a reference to a criticism, grievance or
complaint without suggesting that the criticism, grievance or complaint was
in some sense an allegation of discrimination or otherwise a contravention
of the legislation.’ He argued that the alleged protected acts did not happen
in the way C alleged but that, in any event, complaining about the way JW

spoke to him with no mention of race could not amount to a protected act.

142. Weconsider whether C made an allegation (implied or express) that R or
JW contravened the EA by saying what he said on 12 January 2023, or
whether this was another ‘thing’ done for the purposes of or in connection
with the EA. C did not mention his race or any other protected

characteristic to CT in the course of his conversation with her. He made

10

15

20

8000485/2023 Page 45

no express allegation that JW or anyone else had contravened the EA. He
made no mention of words like ‘discrimination’ or ‘bias’ or ‘prejudice’ in his
conversation. He made no mention of the EA or allude to equalities
legislation or rights more generally, or to any alleged breach of a law or
statute. Merely making a complaint or criticism without conveying some
sense of an allegation of discrimination or other conduct prohibited does
not suffice to satisfy the requirements under EA s.27(2)(d). Nor was there
any evidential basis for a conclusion that the conversation on 12 January
was a thing done for the purposes of or in connection with EA. The
communications C made to CT on that date did not amount to a protected
act.

Alleged Protected Act (2) — ‘Formal grievance’ on 19 June 2023

143. C alleges that he complained of direct discrimination and of an
‘atmosphere of bias and prejudice’ in his email of 19 June. In reality, he
used no such words in that correspondence. Those parts of the email
which are said to imply an allegation of a contravention of the EA have
been set out at paragraphs 132 and 134. He described JW, among other
matters as ‘verbally abusive, brutal, loud and disrespectful’ and said he
had ‘terrible manners’. He alleged that JW used vulgar insults and the f
word when describing other teams. What was lacking from his email was
any suggestion that this conduct related to C’s race or any other protected
characteristic. Nor was there even a suggestion in the email that JW’s
criticised conduct was targeted exclusively at C. On the contrary, C
referred to JW shushing and interrupting their line manager, CT, and
swearing about absent colleagues as well as belittling C himself.

144. Atits highest, C potentially alludes (without using these words) to a double
standard in his email when he juxtaposes his own treatment with that of
JW. He talks of his respectful efforts then goes on immediately thereafter
to observe, “we have ... some characters in the team ... with an attitude
that would guarantee in other settings, an immediate dismissal for gross
misconduct; but these characters are instead left in peace when they
terrorize everyone ... with open brutality and verbal abuse...” Although he
speaks of characters in the plural, C refers to JW alone. This can be
inferred from the rest of his email which includes no complaint about


--- New Page 46 ---
Page number: 46
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 46

anyone else. However, even if the email is read as complaining about JW’s
apparent impunity compared to his own experience, nothing he says
suggests an allegation that the difference is influenced by C’s race. In
these circumstances, we find that C neither makes an allegation of a

5 contravention of the EA in his email, nor is the sending of the email
something he does for the purposes of or in connection with that
legislation.

145. As C did not do a protected act, his complaint of victimisation cannot

succeed and is dis missed.
10 Harassment related to race

146. C’s harassment complaint is premised on an allegation that JW over a
period between 12 January and 19 June repeatedly shouted at, belittled,
mocked and laughed at the claimant. As previously observed, the facts we
have found fall far short of the characterisation of the events in C’s

15 amended pleadings. We recognise there is a potential time bar issue in
relation to the first two of the three incidents complained of, which took
place in January and February/ March 2023. In the interests of efficiency,
we approach the matter by first considering whether those incidents fall
within the definition of harassment. To decide the time bar point, we would

20 require to decide whether there was prohibited conduct extending over a
period which included the earlier incidents. This would necessitate
conclusions about whether those acts were unlawful harassment or other

prohibited conduct so we begin by addressing that question.
Was JW’s conduct unwanted?

25 147. While the three interactions we found took place were neither as extreme
nor as frequent as C’s pleadings suggest, we accept that JW’s tone and
communication style was not welcomed by C. That is supported to some
degree by his decision to complain to CT about the matter on 12 January
2023. We accept, on balance, that JW’s conduct on each of the three

30 occasions was unwanted by C whose reaction was one of considerable

upset.


--- New Page 47 ---
Page number: 47
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 47

Did JW’s unwanted conduct relate to race?

148. C’s argument was that, within his department, he, in particular, was

targeted by JW. Mr Meechan said there was a lack of evidence to establish

C’s harassment allegations generally and particularly a lack of evidence

5 that JW’s conduct related to race. He pointed out it was C’s own evidence
that JW spoke inappropriately about other people who were white.

149. As C would have it, he was trying to innovate in the suggestions and
approaches he was proposing and JW was targeting his work with
criticisms and blocking his innovation. C acknowledged that he alone in

10 the team was trying to innovate with suggestions of the kind he put forward.
JW denied targeting C. As he would have it, C’s innovating was ignoring
‘prior art’. He accepted he would become stern when he had to repeat
himself and believed C was taking the wrong approach (e.g. in relation to
his ‘innovative’ modular approach) or not doing what was asked of him.

15 150. We accept, on the balance of probabilities, that JW communicated with C
in the way he did on the occasions in question because of his genuinely
held views that C’s proposals were not correct. We accept he felt, as time
went on, that C was not willing to engage with R’s way of working. We wish
to be clear that we make no finding as to whether the proposed firewall or

20 the modular approach or generating new passwords as opposed to
copying old ones were or were not sound approaches. What we conclude,
based on the evidence before us is that, rightly or wrongly, JW genuinely
did not agree with C’s proposals and that this disagreement, rather than

C’s race, motivated him to voice his dissent during the three exchanges.

25 151. There was no reference or allusion to C’s race in JW’s words. As regards
JW’s tone and manner, we accept that he expressed himself in a forthright
way, but there was no evidence that this style of communication was
reserved exclusively for C or for people of colour. There was substantial
evidence to the contrary, including from C. JW was forthright and scathing

30 about others in a team of white ethnicity. C witnessed JW ‘shushing’ his
white manager, CT, and interrupting her.

152. Zoe Mackie (who was white) told C about her experience of JW as being
someone with strong opinions and Greg Dolan (also white) told him that

8000485/2023 Page 48

“JW comes off rash and opinionated ... you have to fight your corner.” Both
of them were alluding in their respective conversations with C to their own

experience of JW’s opinionated approach before C had joined the team.

153. While we acknowledge that JW’s forthright and firm manner was not
welcomed or appreciated by C, who found it particularly offensive, we find
it was characteristic of JW’s communication style with work colleagues
irrespective of their ethnicity. We were able to come to a positive finding
on the balance of probabilities that JW’s conduct did not relate to C’s race.
In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to apply the burden of proof
provisions in s.136 of EA (Hewage).

154. C’s complaint of harassment related to race is accordingly dismissed.
Direct Race Discrimination

Allegation (1): CT and DM allegedly permitted JW to behave in an aggressive
and disrespectful way

155. Again, there is a potential time bar issue in relation to the earlier events
relied upon in this complaint. We approach the matter by considering first
whether the events complained of amounted to direct discrimination as
alleged, applying the same reasoning set out in paragraph 146 above in

relation to the harassment complaint arising from the same events.

156. In his submissions, C said CT tried to downplay JW’s behaviour. Mr
Meechan pointed out DM was not present at the meetings in question and
no concerns about JW were brought to his attention by C at the time of the
alleged events. He said that CT’s evidence was that no action was

required.

157. We have found that CT did not raise C’s concerns with JW in relation to
the incident on 12 January 2023 because, after she had explained JW’s
struggles with ADHD, C had asked her to just forget their discussion that
day where he had raised the matter. There was no evidence that C ever
raised the issue with CT again until he copied her into the email of 19 June
or that he ever raised JW’s behaviour with DM until he copied him into that
email. Further, we have accepted that CT did not agree with C’s

8000485/2023 Page 49

characterisation of JW’s behaviour during the exchange in January 2023
or in the two subsequent exchanges about which he gave evidence.

158. We find, as a matter of fact, that CT and DM did not take action in
relation to JW’s conduct during team meetings because they did not view
his conduct in the way that C did and did not consider any intervention
warranted. We find that C’s race had no bearing on the approach taken to
JW by his managers. C did not wish action to be taken. He had asked for
CT to forget it. We accept that CT and DM tolerated a degree of
brusqueness in JW’s communication style because of their knowledge of
his ADHD but find that C’s race in no way influenced their approach in this

regard.

159. Given this positive finding, it is unnecessary to apply the burden of proof
provisions in s.1386 of EA (Hewage). The complaint that CT and DM
permitted JW to behave in a disrespectful way towards C because of C’s

race is, therefore, dismissed.

Allegation (2): On 13 June, CT misrepresented to HR what had happened in her
meeting that day with C

160. The allegation that CT misrepresented her meeting of 13 June with C to
HR has not been established as a matter of fact. The complaint that this
alleged conduct amounted to direct race discrimination is, therefore,

dismissed.
Allegation (3): HR did not follow R’s performance procedure in relation to C

161. This allegation has not been established. R’s disciplinary policy
expressly did not ‘normally apply’ to employees with less than 24 months’
service. In relation to C, we have found that R followed its standard process
which was to arrange a so-called ‘continued employment meeting’ with a
member of R’s HR personnel who would decide the employee’s fate
following such a meeting. There was no difference in C’s treatment as
compared with other employees (including those of white ethnicity) with
less than 23 months’ service whose performance had been raised with the
People Team by their manager as a source of concern.

20

25

8000485/2023 Page 50

162. There was or would be a difference in C’s treatment compared to
employees with more than 24 months’ service. According to R’s policy,
such employees would be dealt with in accordance with R’s procedure and
would be informed in writing of improvements required and given a period
of monitoring. However, individuals with more than 24 months’ service are
not relevant comparators for C since there is a material difference in their
circumstances other than a difference in the protected characteristic of
race. That difference is their longer service and it is this which determines
their differing treatment.

163. The complaint that R did not follow its performance procedure in relation
to C because of his race is, therefore, dismissed.

Allegation (4): C sent code to DM to check which DM did not check

164. C sent an email on 19 June 2023 with links embedded to code he had
written during his employment. DM was not one of the addressees but was
copied into the email, along with CT. The email did not expressly ask that
DM (or any other recipient) check the code linked within it. It is undisputed
that DM did not do so.

165. We accept, on the balance of probabilities, that DM did not do so
because he did not understand he was being asked to do so in the absence
of any request. We accept that DM, who was not a primary recipient,
scanned the email, knowing he would not be present at the meeting which
was be taken forward by LC and DMn. We find, on the balance of
probabilities, that C’s race had no influence whatsoever on DM’s omission
to review the code linked in the email of 19 June 2023. In those
circumstances, it is unnecessary to apply the burden of proof provisions in
s.136 of EA (Hewage).

Allegation (5) R cancelled C’s benefits the day he was dismissed, indicating

prejudgment.

166. The allegation that R cancelled C’s health benefits the day before the
decision was taken to dismiss him has not been found to be established
on the evidence. R made the instruction to the provider after the dismissal

to be actioned with retrospective effect in line with R’s practice. The

15

8000485/2023 Page 51

complaint that this alleged conduct amounted to direct race discrimination
is, therefore, dismissed.

Allegation (6): was C dismissed because of his race?

167. It is not disputed by R that C was dismissed. The reason given by LC in
her letter was C’s ‘overall capability within your role .. specifically in relation
to [his] failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, ... utilise our systems

efficiently and to perform the tasks ... to the standards expected.”

168. In his submission, C pointed out that he was told in his meetings in June
with R that he was expected to commit code 5 or 6 times per day but said
no one in the team was committing that frequently and he was not, in fact
the worst performer. He submitted that CT had never told him there was
anything wrong. He also relied upon DM's reference to him as a
‘passenger in communications and asserted, in effect that DM would not
use that term towards CT or the CEO. C said JW had been verbally
abusive, yet he was not dismissed. He asserted that CT and DM were
reluctant to accept their managerial responsibilities. He said they put the
problem on to HR but that HR merely acted on information given to them
about C’s perceived failure which, he said, was not factual.

169. Mr Meechan said that R’s witnesses were consistent that race was not the
reason for the dismissal. He said C had failed to establish the ‘something
more’ beyond a protected characteristic and less favourable treatment in
order to discharge the initial burden of proof as required by Madarassey.
He said that JW was not a relevant comparator because there were
material differences between their respective circumstances. R did not

have performance concerns in relation to JW.

170. We agree with C’s observation that, although LC ultimately confirmed the
dismissal, that she merely acted on information given to her by C’s
managers. There can be little doubt that this was so. The HR team would
not have convened a ‘continued employment meeting’ if CT and DMn had
not contacted them on 12 June to raise their concerns. They did so, not in
tentative terms, but in a manner that left little room for doubt about their
expected outcome. They said, “Given the above, we believe there isn’t a
role for Marcel in the department given the natural way Marcel likes to work

173.

and his level of exposure to the tools we use.” Ina Teams chat among DM,
DMn and CT on 25 May, DM had expressed himself even more starkly. He
said, ‘We have made the decision to Under 23 months dismiss Marcel -

he’s not worked out and there’s no room for passengers right now.

Although LC was adamant in her evidence that no managers influenced
her decision to dismiss and that she made the decision based on what C
had put forward, we were not persuaded that the wishes of DMn, DM and
CT did not feature in her decision making. We are satisfied, on balance,
that their wishes and view weighed heavily for LC as did the evidence they
put forward regarding C’s performance. In those circumstances, we did not
consider we could decide whether C’s race was an effective cause of the
dismissal by focusing on LC’s decision in isolation. We require also to
decide whether race played a role (conscious or otherwise) in the decision
of those managers to initiate the HR led process.

With respect to C’s submission that CT failed to raise concerns with him,
formally or otherwise, we acknowledge that this is broadly correct. CT
didn’t flag up what she perceived as C’s shortcomings in a way that would
alert him to the seriousness with which she regarded them. Her ‘course
corrections’ were interspersed with smiley emojis and she offered no
warning of the potential consequences of a failure to improve. There was
scant evidence that she specifically raised with him other sources of
frustration such as her unhappiness with the pace of his work or her
perception that he was not listening to guidance. We acknowledge and
accept that, in the circumstances, R’s letter of 14 June 2023 came as a
shock and a blow to C.

The issue for us, however, is whether R dismissed C because of his race.
We acknowledge that perhaps, in a different case, the absence of any
evidence of any performance management might point away from the
existence of a genuine perception that performance was poor. However,
in this case, the evidence led by R that CT did genuinely perceive a
problem was substantial and compelling. We accepted CT’s evidence that
she had considerable frustrations with C’s performance in the role. Her
evidence was corroborated by that of DM with whom she had shared her
frustrations over a period before he decided to escalate the issue with

176.

more senior managers. There accounts were consistent with
contemporary written evidence in the form of the group chats of 25 May
where CT spelled out to the other managers instances which had caused
her concern. That evidence also showed there had been previous
conversations along similar lines. CT said, ‘it’s more of an overall thing, for
his experience, we expected more — sorta what | mentioned to you
already.’ Further, there was evidence before us that both JW and Zoe

Mackie also had misgivings about C’s approach to his role.

We accepted on the balance of probabilities the evidence that CT raised
her criticisms with DM because she held concerns about C’s performance
and not for any reason related to his race. We were satisfied that CT
declined to raise the matters with C because she was someone who shied
away from what she perceived as confrontation. We also accepted that
she felt bad about C’s fate and her own possible failings in the matter. (She
said as much in the group chat of 25 May 2023). We further accept DM’s
evidence that he made his decision to escalate the issue to HR based on
based on CT’s criticisms of C’s performance and not on C’s race. As set
out above, there was ample evidence that he had liaised with CT about
her concerns regarding C. There was no evidence which might give us to
infer some alternative racial motivation on DM’s part. DM and CT had

made the decision to hire C following an interview which they conducted.

C sought to rely on his analysis that he was not the least frequent pusher
of code to GitHub. We did not agree that this materially undermined the
evidence of R’s witnesses that his race played no role in their decision
making. R had not carried out this analysis of the GitHub logs at the time
of dismissal and nor had C so the figures presented to the Tribunal were

not before R’s managers at the time.

In any event, Greg Dolan was not a comparator in materially the same
circumstances as C. Mr Dolan was engaged on different tasks in the
material period which did not require the same frequency of code commits.
There was also no evidence that CT had repeatedly reminded Greg to
commit code in the way she had C, with little success. CT’s own
circumstances likewise differed to C’s. She had the managerial role of
Lead Engineer and we do not accept her own pushing frequency can be


--- New Page 54 ---
Page number: 54
Title of ebook of origin: 8000485_Judgment_050624.pdf

8000485/2023 Page 54

relevantly compared with C’s. Although no one in the team was committing
the 5 or 6 times per day that DMn indicated he would expect, the average
figures calculated by C showed that JW was committing more than ten
times as frequently as C. They showed that C was not close to committing
5 as much as once per day which CT had commended to him as ‘good

practice ... at a minimum’.

177. Nor did we did not find C’s comparisons of his treatment with that of JW to
be illuminating in all the circumstances of the case. C did not suggest that
JW’s circumstances were the same in all material respects to his own.
10 They plainly were not. JW did not have less than 23 months’ service. JW
had not been encouraged by CT to commit code more frequently. CT had
no concerns about JW’s performance. JW did not commit code with the
same frequency as C or advocate the same approach as C to the tasks
set.

15 178. Instead, C’s position was that JW conducted himself in a worse manner
than C yet avoided dismissal. A material difference is that CT did not agree
with C’s view of JW’s conduct. She did not accept him to be verbally
abusive. She acknowledged he could say things in “the wrong way” and
had challenges managing his anger. She attributed JW’s manner, at least

20 to some extent, to his ADHD. She was not in receipt of any complaints
about JW’s behaviour from team members other than C who complained
on 12 January but asked her to forget it later in the day.

179. We accept CT did not dismiss JW or formalise any procedure against him
because she did not consider such action to be warranted by JW’s

25 conduct. JW was neither a relevant comparator in materially the same
circumstances, nor was he a helpful ‘evidential’ comparator. The factual
circumstances which pertained to him differed so markedly to those of C

that the evidential value of his comparative ‘treatment’ was extremely

weak.

30 180. We further accept LC’s evidence that she made the ultimate decision to
dismiss based on CT’s criticisms of C’s performance and the evidence she
had received about these. We accept she did not dismiss because of C’s
race. We saw he evidence which was provided to her by CT in June 2023

and we concluded she genuinely believed there was a problem with C’s
performance in his role based on that evidence. There was no evidence

which might give us to infer some alternative racial motivation on LC’s part.

We were satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that R did not dismiss C
because of C’s race. Neither CT not DM nor LC acted as they did for
reasons related to C’s race. As we are in a position to make a positive
finding, it is unnecessary to apply the burden of proof provisions in section
136 (Hewage). In so finding, we do not make any finding about C’s
competence or otherwise as a DevOps Engineer. C has been anxious to
persuade us of the appropriateness of the modular approach and to
advocate the merits of his other thought processes and decisions in
approaching work tasks. We have found that CT perceived C’s
performance as inadequate and that she passed her assessments on to
other managers, who agreed with her criticisms. We venture no view on
whether or not she or they were objectively right or wrong in that
assessment; we find only that race played no role.

The claimant’s complaints of direct race discrimination are, therefore,
dismissed.
