Policy

1. Introduction
This Policy has been formulated to provide fair, speedy and effective arrangements for dealing with
disciplinary matters. It is intended to cover all cases of misconduct, including minor, serious, cumulative and
gross misconduct, and those instances of poor work performance which do not result from genuine lack of
capability on the part of the employee to carry out the duties or responsibilities of his/her job.
The policy has been drafted in accordance with the principles contained in the ACAS Code of Practice on
Disciplinary Procedures and in accordance with various Employment and Education Acts.
2. General Principles
This procedure applies to all employees but does not apply to dismissal for grounds of redundancy or where
the individual has not completed the probation period and dismissal arises from unsuitability for
confirmation of employment:


Employees have a responsibility to be aware of Academy policies which set out clear standards
expected of them: - e.g. Equality Policy, Health and Safety Policy, Staff Code of Conduct.



The Disciplinary Procedure will be made readily accessible to all employees within the Academy in
electronic form or printed on request.



In instances of poor work performance formal action under this procedure will only be taken where
the poor performance does not result from a lack of capability to carry out work duties. The SMA
Capability Policy will then apply.



No disciplinary action will be taken until the matter concerned has been investigated. At all stages,
employees will be entitled to state their case before decisions are reached.



Before taking any disciplinary action in accordance with this policy and if appropriate, managers will
initially try and resolve the matter informally in order to make the employee aware of the problem
and to give them the opportunity to correct it. This will be done through discussions with the
employee as part of their day to day management responsibilities.



The disciplinary procedure provides a framework to deal with any employee whose standard of
conduct or work practice continues to fall short of that required. Disciplinary action will be invoked
only with the agreement and involvement of a member of the Senior Leadership Group.



The Academy has the right to initiate the disciplinary procedure at any level depending on the specific
circumstances of the case. The formal procedure is always applicable in cases which may constitute
gross misconduct.



An employee will not be summarily dismissed (that is without notice) for a first breach of discipline,
except in the event of gross misconduct. If an employee is dismissed for other misconduct, such a
dismissal will be with notice or payment in lieu of notice.



There is no right of appeal against any non-disciplinary action nor against any informal action taken
by management. Employees have the right however to appeal against any formal disciplinary
sanction

3. Investigating, Disciplinary and Appeal Managers

Non-Disciplinary Action


A manager will initially try and resolve the matter informally in order to make the employee aware of
the problem and to give them the opportunity to correct it before taking any disciplinary action in
accordance with this policy. This will be done through discussions with the employee as part of their
day to day management responsibilities.



Informal warning may be recorded in writing and referred to at a later stage to evidence that an
informal approach was attempted and the success or failure of such an approach.



Failure to comply with informal action should not, on its own, be used as justification for issuing
a higher form of sanction than would otherwise have been imposed under the formal process.

4.

Informal Disciplinary Action
i.

This section deals with minor disciplinary issues and will only be used for cases not involving serious
or gross misconduct where formal action will be instigated immediately.

ii.

The employee will be asked to attend an informal meeting with a senior manager or with the line
manager supported by a member of the HR team as appropriate and will be given the opportunity to
discuss any reasons for concern regarding misconduct or poor performance. This will be confirmed to
the employee in writing.

iii.

Although this process is intended to be informal if the employee wishes he/she may be accompanied
by a trade union representative or another employee, who, where appropriate, may speak on the
employee's behalf.

iv.

If during an informal meeting it becomes clear that the matter is more serious than first thought, the
meeting will be adjourned and a decision made as to whether formal action will be taken immediately.
The employee will be kept informed in writing of any decisions and associated timescales.

v.

Discussion: Where appropriate managers may seek assistance from a senior manager or the academy
HR Manager who will support them in exploring any underlying reasons with the employee. Support
for the employee may be provided in the form of advice for improvement or training. Where
improvement is required, the manager will be responsible for ensuring that the employee understands
what is expected of them. Employees will also be made aware of what action will be taken if they fail
to improve.

vi.

Confirmation: Notes from this meeting will be taken given in written form to the employee or, where
appropriate, be put into a standard setting letter. This will include details of the standards expected of
the employee, how they will be reviewed and over what time period. Employees will also be made
aware of what action will be taken if they fail to improve.

vii.

Outcomes. If the employee subsequently achieves the required improvements, and if appropriate, this
will be recorded in writing, given to the employee and a copy will be placed on the personal file. The
employee may comment on the content of the note if he or she wishes and this will also be placed on
the personal file. Where the required improvement is not reached or maintained or a further issue
arises then the manager may decide to meet again and issue a further standard setting letter. If at any
meetings, the manager feels that it is appropriate to issue a verbal warning or proceed to formal
disciplinary or capability action as appropriate, this will have first been approved by the Head teacher.
A member of the HR team may also be present at this meeting.

viii.

Verbal Warning. Depending on the nature of the misconduct or poor performance, in consultation
with the HR department, the manager may proceed immediately to issue a verbal warning to the
employee advising him/her that any further incidents could lead to formal disciplinary action being
taken. The verbal warning and any actions recommended will be confirmed to the employee in writing
and a copy placed on the employee’s personal file. The employee may comment on the content of the
note and this will also be placed on file for a period of 6 months.

ix.

If there is any further misconduct of any type within a period of 6 months from the date of the issue
of a verbal warning, then the employee will be subject to formal disciplinary action and the verbal
warning may be taken into account.

5. Formal Disciplinary Action


Where informal action has not been successful in resolving issues of conduct and poor performance,
or where there are cases of serious or gross misconduct, formal action in accordance with this policy
may be taken.



If formal action is to be taken, there will be an initial investigation, following which the employee may
be asked to attend a formal disciplinary hearing. The employee will be informed in writing of the date,
time and place of the hearing including details of the allegation/s against them.



Employees have the right to be accompanied by a trade union representative or another employee
at every stage of the formal disciplinary procedure, including the investigation stages, although the
employee must make her/his own arrangements for this. If the employee requests to be accompanied
by a colleague, then the colleague will be given reasonable time off for this purpose.



No formal disciplinary action will be taken against a trade union official until the circumstances of the
case have been raised with a senior representative or full time official of the union concerned.

6. Step 1 - Management Investigation
i.

The investigating Manager will conduct an investigation into the alleged misconduct. A fact finding
exercise will be undertaken in order to accumulate sufficient information to determine whether or
not the matter needs to be pursued formally. This is normally delegated to a member of the senior
management team.

ii.

The fact finding exercise may involve interviewing the parties concerned. Statements will be obtained
from any witnesses and records kept of what was said. Employees are required to co-operate with
any investigation and to attend a fact-finding meeting at which they may be accompanied by a trade
union representative or another employee.

iii.

If, following the fact-finding exercise, the investigating manager considers that the matter should be
pursued formally, the Headteacher will be informed.

iv.

If it is found that formal disciplinary action is not appropriate, the Headteacher will decide whether
any other action is necessary in accordance with the Academy's procedures or other guidelines. The
employee will be notified of any decision in writing.

v.

If a decision is made to pursue formal disciplinary action a disciplinary hearing will be convened as
soon as possible.

vi.

All relevant evidence gathered as part of the management investigation will be disclosed to the
employee prior to the hearing.

7. Suspension


An employee may be suspended by the Headteacher where the possibility of dismissal for gross
misconduct may arise or where there are grounds for doubt as to the suitability to continue at work
pending a fact-finding exercise and disciplinary hearing. Suspension will be confirmed in writing
within 3 working days with the reasons for the suspension.



All reasonable steps will be taken to notify the employees’ trade union representative at the time of
the suspension. Where possible the employee may be accompanied to the suspension meeting by a
trade union representative or another work colleague.



The suspension will not be used as a punishment and the employee will normally receive full pay for
the period of suspension (i.e. what the employee would have received if working normally) for the
period of the suspension.



The suspension will be reviewed after 10 working days and thereafter every 10 working days or sooner
if appropriate.



During the period of suspension, the employee must not enter the work place without prior
permission from the Headteacher. A request to meet with the trade union representative on
Academy premises will not be unreasonably denied.

8. Step 2 - The Disciplinary Hearing


A disciplinary hearing will be convened within 10 working days of the decision that there is a case to
answer, other than in exceptional circumstances warranting a delay.



The employee will be given not less than 5 working days’ notice of the hearing. Any management
documentary evidence/witness statements must also be produced for all parties no later than 5
working days before the hearing.



The employee may submit written observations on the statement prior to the hearing. These written
observations may form the basis of the employee’s case at the hearing but are not for the purpose of
influencing whether or not the hearing will be held. These, and any other documents the employee
may wish to present, must be produced for all parties no later than 2 working days before the hearing.



Where an employee has reasonably requested to be accompanied at a hearing and his/her
representative is unable to attend on the notified date, he/she has the right to request a
postponement of the hearing for a period of up to 5 working days following the day after the date
which had previously been set. In this event a new date will be arranged as quickly as possible. A
request for a postponement should be made as soon as possible after notification of the hearing date.
The disciplinary hearing will be rescheduled for a maximum of one occasion at the request of the
employee and thereafter the employee will be informed that the hearing will be held in the employee’s
absence if they are unable to attend.



The hearing manager will hold the disciplinary hearing (see appendix 3 for procedure). Where possible
a HR Representative will be present as a note taker and to advise on procedural matters. The employee
has the right to be accompanied by a member of the trade union or an employee of St Matthew
Academy, who will also be able to take notes.



Where an employee is unable to attend a hearing s/he is entitled to be represented in their absence.

The hearing manager will have the discretion to proceed in the employee’s absence. When exercising
this discretion, the hearing manager will take into account all relevant circumstances, for example
medical evidence, the number of postponements previously made. Letters requesting the employee
to attend the hearing will make it clear that the hearing may proceed in their absence.


Once all the evidence has been considered, the Disciplinary Manager will confirm the outcome of the
Disciplinary Meeting in writing to you within 5 working days of the date of the Disciplinary Meeting.

9. Possible Outcomes of the Hearing
The hearing officer will deliberate on the verbal and written evidence presented and will make a
recommendation to the Headteacher based on the hearing. The final decision on any outcome will be the
Headteacher.


No disciplinary action to be taken. If it is decided that formal disciplinary action is not appropriate,
the employee will be informed in writing. All records of the disciplinary hearing, including the letter to
the employee, will be removed from the employee's personal file and destroyed. The employee will
still receive confirmation of the outcome in writing, but will be advised that no record (other than the
above) has been kept on the personal file.



Written or final written warning: in these circumstances the employee will be advised that any further
disciplinary lapse may result in further disciplinary action including dismissal. All the circumstances of
the case will be taken into account in reaching a decision about which sanction to apply. These
warnings are considered ‘live’ for disciplinary purposes as follows:
Written warning (12 months from date of hearing)
Final written warning (18 months from date of hearing)





Spent warnings will normally be disregarded only for the purpose of future disciplinary proceedings.
For other managerial purposes (e.g. appointments, references), the warning will remain on the record
and may be taken into account as appropriate. Managers will not therefore remove the spent warning
from the personal file.



Dismissal with notice: in circumstances other than gross misconduct this will be after previous written
warning or cumulative misconduct and will be dismissal with notice. Except in the event of gross
misconduct, an employee may not be summarily dismissed for a first breach of discipline.



Summary dismissal without notice in most cases of gross misconduct.



Relegation: Where the employee is considered to be blameworthy of an offence(s) but there are
deemed to be mitigating circumstances to justify disciplinary action short of dismissal, in limited
circumstances and where appropriate the sanction may be relegation (downgrading). Payment will be
commensurate to the grade of the new post. Relegation could also be accompanied by a transfer to a
completely new work area, together with a final or indefinite written warning. If the employee does
not accept the relegation, then the dismissal will stand.



Further misconduct. If this occurs during the set ‘live’ time period, then further disciplinary action
must be considered. In addition, there may be occasions where an employee's conduct is satisfactory
throughout the period the warning in is force, only for it to lapse soon thereafter. Where a pattern
emerges and there is evidence of abuse, disciplinary action must be considered and the employee's
disciplinary record will be borne in mind in deciding what sanction to apply.

10. Step 3 - Appeals
An employee wishing to appeal against formal disciplinary action must do so in writing to the Chair of
Governors within 10 working days of receiving written notification of the disciplinary action. An appeal will not
normally proceed until sufficient details of the grounds of the appeal are provided. The appeal letter must
clearly state the grounds for the appeal which fall into 3 categories:
i.
ii.
iii.

a procedural flaw, stating precisely where the procedure has been breached
the severity of the sanction, stating precisely why it was thought that the sanction was too severe
any other perceived unfairness of the decision, stating precisely what this was.



All appeals will be heard by a Disciplinary Appeals Committee and will consist of not less than three
governors. Where possible an HR Representative will be present as a note taker and to provide advice
to the Committee.



Procedures to be followed at an appeal hearing are laid out in Appendix 4.



The Appeals Committee will hear the appeal as soon as practically possible. Generally, this will be
within 15 working days of registration of the appeal with the Chair of Governors or as soon as possible
thereafter.



If the employee or trade union representative has any concerns about the impartiality of the proposed
members of the Appeal Committee, this will be referred to the Chair of Governors.



The employee will have the right to be accompanied by a trade union representative or an employee
of St Matthew Academy at the Appeal Hearing.



Where an employee has reasonably requested to be accompanied at an appeal hearing and his/her
representative is unable to attend on the notified date, he/she has the right to request a postponement
of the hearing for a period of up to 5 working days following the day after the date which had previously
been set. In this event a new date will be arranged as quickly as possible. The appeal hearing will be
rescheduled for a maximum of one occasion at the request of the employee and there after the
employee will be informed that the hearing will be held in the employees’ absence if they are unable
to attend.



Where an employee is unable to attend the appeal hearing he/she is entitled to be represented in their
absence. The Appeal Committee, following consultation with the union representative, will have the
discretion to proceed in the employee's absence.



The employee will be given not less than 5 working days’ notice of the Hearing and will be provided
with a copy of all the documentary evidence. New evidence or additional witnesses will not be allowed
save in exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the Appeal Committee.



The hearing manager at the original Disciplinary Hearing or the Headteacher will normally present the
Management's case to the Appeal Committee. The Headteacher must ensure that the Appeal
Committee is presented with sufficient evidence as to the basis of his/her decision on the points which
are the subject of the appeal. This may include, for example, providing management notes of the
original hearing or calling appropriate witnesses



The Appeal Committee will not normally rehear the case but only consider the grounds of appeal and





whether the decision taken and the sanction given by the original hearing manager was reasonable in
all the circumstances of the case based on the evidence put before him/her at the time. Specifically,
the Appeal Committee will consider whether the original hearing manager had sufficient evidence
available in order to come to a reasoned judgement and can demonstrate that the arguments and
reasoning, of both sides, were fully considered when reaching a decision on his/her recommendation.
In exceptional circumstances the Appeal Committee may request to hear from a particular witness or
re-consider a piece of evidence. For example, it may be necessary to hear evidence about whether
there was an adequate or appropriate investigation or whether there was a procedural flaw which
could be rectified by the appeal.
The final decision on any matter will rest with the Appeal Committee following consultation with both
parties.

11. Outcome of The Appeal Hearing
The Appeal Manager will confirm the outcome of the Appeal Meeting in writing to you within 5 working days
of the date of the Appeal Meeting. The decision of the Appeal Manager is final and there will be no further
right of appeal.
The outcomes of the Appeal Meeting are:
i.
ii.
iii.

The Appeal Manager may uphold the decision of the Disciplinary Manager; or
The Appeal Manager may uphold your appeal and overturn the decision of the
Disciplinary Manager
The Appeal Manager may impose a lesser sanction

12. Complaint Against the Headteacher


Complaints made against the Headteacher will be referred to the Chair of Governors.



The Chair of Governors will initiate an investigation into the complaint at the same time notifying the
Diocesan Director for Education. If, as a result of the investigation, the Chair of Governors is of the view
that the Headteacher has a case to answer, he/she will arrange for a Disciplinary Panel of 3 governors
to hear the case.



The case will normally be presented by the Chair of Governors. Alternatively, the Chair of Governors
may request a representative of the Sponsor (the Archdiocese of Southwark) to nominate a senior
diocesan manager, or recommend an appropriately qualified external person, to undertake the
investigation and present the case at any subsequent disciplinary hearing.



Where there is a possibility of disciplinary action, the Chair of Governors must ensure that there are
sufficient governors available to carry out impartially the functions of any disciplinary and appeals
hearings. Members of the disciplinary and appeals hearing need not be left in complete ignorance as
knowing about a situation does not constitute prejudice. However, members of hearings will be careful
not to become directly involved, either through expressing opinions or taking action which might be
seen to have prejudiced their ability to hear a case fairly.



The diocesan Director for Education may attend or be represented at any disciplinary or appeal
hearing

Appendix 1. Gross Misconduct
Gross Misconduct is misconduct of such a serious nature that the Academy is justified in no longer tolerating the
employee’s continued presence at the place of work. If, after investigation, it is deemed that an employee has
committed an offence of the following nature (the list is not exhaustive), the normal consequence will be
dismissal without notice:

remain in the Academy’s employment or which may damage the Academy's reputation. Or where
there are reasonable grounds to believe that a serious criminal offence has been committed which
may be connected or unconnected with their employment.
