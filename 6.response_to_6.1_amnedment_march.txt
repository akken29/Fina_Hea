Case Number 8000485/2023

 

 

M SANGARE
Claimant
against

ARNOLD CLARK AUTOMOBILES LIMITED

Respondent
RESPONSE TO 6.1 — PAPER APART (AMENDED MARCH 2024)
1 THE PARTIES

1.1 The Claimant was employed by Amold Clark Automobiles Limited.

1.2 The Respondent is an automotive retailer operating more than 200 branches throughout the
UK. The Respondent employs approximately 10,000 members of staff.

1.3 The Claimant was employed by the Respondent, as a Dev Ops Engineer, from 7 December

2022 until 22 June 2023. The Claimant was based at the Respondent’s head office at
Hillington, Glasgow, with remote working from home.

1.4 The Claimant’s employment contract provided that the Claimant was entitled to one week’s
notice for each complete year of service, up to maximum of twelve weeks; and that the
Respondent reserved the right to terminate employment immediately by making a payment of
basic salary in lieu of notice.

2 PRELIMINARY ISSUES
Time Bar
2.1 The Respondent reserves its position in respect of time bar.
2.2 To the extent that any relevant acts or omissions occurred more than three months before the

presentation of the Claim Form on 25 September 2023 (subject to the extension of time as a
result of the interplay with the Early Conciliation regime from 31 July 2023 to 4 September

2023) the claims have been brought out with the time limits. Accordingly, the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear such claims.

2.3 Based on the information currently available, it is denied that any allegations of discrimination
set out in the claim form part of a continuing act ending within the relevant time limit under
section 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010 (‘the 2010 Act’), or that it would be just and
equitable for the tribunal to extend time for submission of the claim under section 123(1)(b)

of the Act.
3 THE CLAIMANT’S PERFORMANCE/CAPABILITY
3.1 The Claimant’s line manager, Claire Thomson (Digital Product Development Technical

Lead), contacted the Respondent’s People Team on 12 June 2023 with concerns in relation to
the Claimant’s performance.

3.2 On 14 June 2023, Laura Cooper (People Advisor in the Respondent’s People Team) invited
the Claimant to a meeting to discuss the Claimant’s performance and continued employment.
The invite letter warned the Claimant that termination of employment was a possible outcome;
confirmed who would attend the meeting; and advised the Claimant that he could be
accompanied by a work colleague or trade union representative.

3.3 In particular, and as the Claimant was advised, the Respondent had concerns about the
Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and to
perform the tasks expected in the Claimant’s role to the standards expected.

3.4 The Continued Employment meeting was held on 20 June 2023 and was chaired by Laura
Cooper. David Middleton (Head of Digital Talent) was present as management representative
and the Claimant chose to be unaccompanied. Due to time constraints the meeting was
adjourned and reconvened on 22 June 2023.

3.5 The Respondent’s concerns were discussed in detail with the Claimant and he was given the
opportunity to respond and put forward any mitigation.

3.6 During the adjournment, Laura Cooper discussed some of the Claimant’s allegations with
Claire Thomson. After doing so, she was satisfied that the Respondent’s concerns in relation
to the Claimant’s performance were well founded and that dismissal was the appropriate
outcome of the meeting.

3.7 The Respondent decided to terminate the Claimant’s employment, and this was confirmed to
the Claimant by letter on 22 June 2023 (the letter was dated 1 September 2023 in error). The
letter confirmed that his last date of employment was 22 June 2023 and the Claimant was
informed of his right to appeal.

3.8 The reason for the termination of employment was capability and specifically in relation to

the Claimant’s failure to perform tasks in a timely manner, to utilise systems efficiently and
to performance the tasks expected in his role to the standards expected.

3.9 The Claimant did not appeal against the termination of his employment.
4 OTHER ALLEGATIONS

4.1 It is denied that the Claimant’s manager never expressed concerns with the Claimant’s
performance. While the Respondent’s performance concerns had not been addressed formally
with the Claimant until the Continued Employment process, the Claimant’s line manager had
raised concerns with the Claimant informally, including pointing out to him occasions on
which tasks had not been completed properly and corrections had to be made.

4.2 The Claimant did not raise a grievance about any of the allegations in his ET1, or otherwise.

43 It is denied that the Claimant formally complained about “a colleague’s violent behaviour’;
or that this was “endorsed” by his manager’; or that it had anything to do with his dismissal.
The Claimant was dismissed because of his poor performance.

4.4 It is denied that there was a “constructed narrative to unjustly terminate” the Claimant. The
Claimant was dismissed, in accordance with the Respondent’s relevant procedures, because
of capability. It is denied that there were any “racial undertones in the actions of HR and [the
Claimant’s manager” or that race was relevant in any way to the process followed and/or the
termination of the Claimant’s employment.

4.5 It denied that the Respondent has “shielded” “others in the company whose genuine
incompetence endangered the business and staff.”

5 AUTOMATICALLY UNFAIR DISMISSAL

5.1 It is denied that the Claimant was automatically unfairly dismissed because he allegedly made
a protected disclosure.

5.2 The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as explained in section 3 above.

6 WHISTLEBLOWING DETRIMENT

6.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to a detriment contrary to section 47B of the
Employment Rights Act 1996 because he made one or more protected disclosures, as alleged
or at all.

6.2 In particular,

6.2.1 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the
claimant told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had
spoken to him at the meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to
insecurity in the department and was having an effect on his own health and safety
and on that of the whole team". The claimant did say that he was not comfortable
with the way Jason White had spoken to him, and that he found it condescending,

72

but he did not mention anything about it being “insulting, abusive and violent” or
having any impact on “health and safety”.

6.2.2 It is denied that “on or about 12 January 2023, following a cyber-security breach of
the respondent’s systems in December 2022, the claimant told his manager Claire
Thomson that the action of Jason White in copying passwords from the old system
to the new one was contrary to the respondent’s legal obligations following a cyber
security breach”. The claimant did raise an issue with the practice of copying
passwords, but he did not say to Claire Thomson that he considered this to be in
breach of any legal obligation and the process and reason for it was explained to him
by Claire Thomson.

6.2.3 It is accepted that the Claimant emailed Claire Thomson, David Moffat and the
Respondent’s HR department on 19 June 2023, in which he complained about how
Mr White had spoken to him. However, it is denied that this amounted to a protected
disclosure. It is also denied that the Claimant made allegations of “IT malpractice
and breach of the respondent’s legal obligations relating to data protection” in this
email. It is accepted that the Claimant made suggestions about how the Respondent
could improve its coding practices and IT “hygiene”, but the email did not allege
any breach of legal obligations in this regard, whether related to data protection or
otherwise.

6.2.4 It is denied that the disclosures referred to in paragraphs 6.2.1 to 6.2.3 above
occurred as alleged by the Claimant and furthermore on either the Claimant or
Respondent’s version of the alleged ‘disclosures’, the relevant ‘disclosures’ were
not protected disclosures for the purposes of the Employment Rights Act 1996.

6.3 It is denied that “management and HR terminated his employment in a way that was
predetermined and not in accordance with the respondent’s procedures for managing
performance without any proper basis for doing so.” The Claimant’s dismissal was not
predetermined and the decision to dismiss was made in accordance with the Respondent’s
usual practice in the circumstances, including inviting the Claimant to a ‘continued
employment’ meeting to discuss the Respondent’s concerns before making its decision.

6.4 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was subjected to the above alleged detriment, which is
denied, it is denied that this was because he made a protected disclosure.

7 DIRECT RACE DISCRIMINATION

7.1 It is denied that the Respondent treated the Claimant less favourably that it would have treated
others, because of race, as alleged or at all.

7.2 In particular:
7.2.1 It is denied that Claire Thomson (the Claimant’s line manager) and David Moffat

(the Claimant’s second line manager) permitted Jason White (Dev Ops Engineer) to

73

behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the Claimant during video
meetings at which they were present and to humiliate the Claimant without
challenging Jason White’s behaviour. It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed
because of performance and Jason White was not, under explanation that this was
because the Respondent did not have the same concerns about Jason White’s
performance as it did with the Claimant.

7.2.2 It is denied that, on or about 13 June 2023, Claire Thomson misrepresented to HR
what had happened at a meeting with the Claimant that day.

7.2.3 The Claimant says the Respondent did not follow its performance procedure in
relation to the Claimant. The Respondent does not operate a standalone performance
procedure but follows its disciplinary procedure in circumstances where there are
concerns about performance. As set out in the disciplinary procedure, the procedure
will not normally apply in the case of employees with less than 24 months’ service.
In those circumstances, the Respondent’s practice is to hold a ‘continued
employment’ meeting with the employee at which the concerns are discussed, and
the employee is given an opportunity to respond to those concerns before any
decision is made. This is what happened in the Claimant’s case.

7.2.4 It is accepted that the Claimant sent code in an email which was copied to David
Moffat on 19 June 2023 and that David Moffat did not check the code. However, it
is denied that the code was sent to David Moffat “to check.” It was included in an
email sent to Laura Cooper and David Middleton, as the people who would be
involved in the Claimant’s continued employment meeting the next day, raising a
number of different points and issues. David Moffat was not due to attend that
meeting and did not consider he was expected to check the code. In any event, David
Moffat’s not checking the code was not because of race.

7.2.5 It is denied that the Claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
continued employment meeting. It is explained that when an employee is dismissed
by the Respondent, AXA benefits are cancelled following dismissal but to take
effect from the day before the last day of employment.

7.2.6 It is denied that the Claimant was dismissed because of his race. The Claimant was
dismissed because of capability, as explained at section 3 above.

7.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was treated less favourably, as alleged above, it is
denied that this was because of race.

7.4 It is denied that the Claimant’s comparators, namely “Jason White and other white employees
of the Respondent” are appropriate comparators. An appropriate comparator is someone in
relation to whom there is no material difference between the circumstances (except for the
existence of the protected characteristic).

8 RACE RELATED HARASSMENT

8.1 It is denied that the Claimant was subjected to harassment related to race, as alleged or at all,
in terms of section 26 of the 2010 Ac.

8.2 It is denied that the Claimant suffered unwanted conduct, as alleged, namely: “Over a period
between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the
Claimant repeatedly at daily meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”, belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of others. In particular,
at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS
which involved a modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those present and
mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you’re doing. Let me tell you one more
time.”

8.3 If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did suffer the alleged unwanted conduct, it is denied
that it was related to race; and/or that it had the purpose or effect of violating the Claimant’s
dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
for the Claimant, and/or that it was reasonable for the Claimant to regard it as having that

effect.
9 VICTIMISATION
9.1 It is denied that the Respondent has subjected the Claimant to a detriment because he did a

protected act, in terms of section 27 of the 2010 Act.

9.2 It is denied that on or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the Claimant told
his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White had spoken to him at the
meeting was insulting, abusive and violent, was contributing to insecurity in the department
and was having an effect on his own health and safety and that of the whole team.” In any
event, it is denied that this is capable of amounting to a protected act in terms of section 27 of
the 2010 Act.

9.3 It is denied that the Claimant submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice. It is accepted that this will
amount to a protected act if the Tribunals finds this did happen (which is denied).

9.4 It is accepted that the Claimant was dismissed but it is denied that this was because he did a
protected act, as alleged or at all. The Claimant was dismissed because of capability, as
explained at section 3 above.

10 REMEDY

10.1 It is denied that the Claimant is entitled to any of the remedies sought within the ET1 Claim
Form.

10.2 If the Tribunal finds that any compensation is due to the Claimant, the Respondent contends
that this should be reduced to reflect:

10.2.1 Section 123 of the Employment Rights Act 1996;
10.2.2 the principles set out in Polkey v AE Dayton Services Ltd [1987] IRLR 503;
10.2.3. the Claimant’s contribution to any dismissal found to have taken place;

10.2.4 any failure found to have occurred in respect of any applicable provisions of the
ACAS Code of Practice relating to disciplinary and grievances, namely the Claimant
did not appeal his dismissal, nor did he raise a grievance;

10.2.5 any failure by the Claimant to have taken reasonable steps to mitigate his losses;
and/or

10.2.6 any earnings received by the Claimant subsequent to the termination of his
employment by way of alternative employment, state benefits or otherwise.

10.3 The Claimant is called upon to provide a detailed Schedule of Loss, showing the details of
any compensation sought, together with details of all income (including state benefits)
claimed and/or received, and all steps taken to mitigate his alleged losses since his
employment with the Respondent ended.

10.4 At Section 9.1 of the ET1 Claim Form, the Claimant seeks a recommendation. It is unclear
what recommendation is sought but in any event, it is denied that it would be appropriate for
the tribunal to make a recommendation given that the Claimant is no longer employed by the

Respondent.
11 GENERAL
11.1 Save as set out above no admissions are made in relation to the claim form and the grounds

of claim or remedies sought.
