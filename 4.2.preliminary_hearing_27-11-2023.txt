NOTE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY HEARING

1. The claimant was employed by the respondent as a Dev Ops Engineer from 7
December 2022 until 22 June 2023. He worked remotely from home. Following
the termination of his employment, the claimant notified ACAS of his intention
to make an application to the Employment Tribunal on 31 July 2023. The
claimant received an early conciliation certificate from ACAS on 4 September
2023 and presented an application to the Employment Tribunal on 25
September 2023 in which he claimed unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, race
discrimination and subjection to detriment and dismissal by reason of having

made a protected disclosure.

List of Issues Claimant wishes to raise

 

2. | went through the issues the claimant had raised in his ET1 and PH Agenda.
On behalf of the respondent, Mr Meechan submitted that the claimant had
raised issues in his PH Agenda and at the PH today which were not in his ET1.
Mr Meechan submitted that these additional issues would require to be the
subject of an application by the claimant to amend the ET1 and that the
respondent would be likely to oppose such an application. This was discussed
and we agreed that | would issue this Note setting out the claimant's claims as
understood following today’s discussions. Mr Meechan would then have 7 days
from his receipt of this Note within which to indicate which claims he challenged
as not foreshadowed in the ET1. Thereafter, the claimant would have 14 days
from Mr Meechan’s challenge within which to make any application to amend.
The issues raised were as follows:

Direct Discrimination

 

1. Did the respondent, because of the claimant’s race, treat the claimant less
favourably than it would have treated others? The less favourable treatment
alleged by the claimant is as follows. The claimant will say that:

a. Jason White, Dev Ops Engineer was permitted by the claimant’s line
manager Claire Thomson and second line manager, David Moffat to
behave in an aggressive and disrespectful way towards the claimant
in the manner described below at video meetings at which they were
present and to humiliate the claimant without any steps being taken

to challenge his behaviour. By contrast, the claimant was subjected to
the respondent’s performance procedure and dismissed.

Thomson misrepresented to HR what had happened at a meeting with
the claimant that day.

c. HR did not follow the respondent’s performance procedure in relation
to the claimant;

d. The claimant sent the code he had written to David Moffat to check.
Despite being a software developer, Mr Moffat did not check the
claimant’s code.

e. The claimant’s employee benefits were cancelled the day before the
meeting at which he was dismissed indicating prejudgment.

f. The claimant was dismissed on grounds of poor performance. He will
argue that, as his performance was not poor, he was dismissed
because of his race.

2. The claimant’s comparators are Jason White and other white employees of
the respondent.

Harassment

3. Did the claimant suffer unwanted conduct as follows? The claimant will say
that:

a. Over a period between 12 January and around 19 June 2023 Jason
White, Dev Ops Engineer shouted at the claimant repeatedly at daily
team meetings, would not let the claimant speak, told him: “shut up,
I’m speaking”; belittled the claimant and criticised his work in front of
others. In particular, at a meeting in early June 2023, Mr White
criticised a code the claimant had written for AWS which involved a
modular approach. He laughed at the claimant in front of those
present and mocked him with the words: “You don’t know what you're
doing. Let me tell you one more time..”

4. Was this related to the claimant’s race?

5. If so, did this conduct have the purpose or effect of violating his dignity,
or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive

environment for the claimant?

Indirect Discrimination

performance in the claimant's department, so as to obtain objective

information upon which performance could be assessed with transparency ?

7. Was that practice applied to white and non-white employees in the claimant's
department?

8. Did the practice put (or would it put) non-white employees in the claimant’s
department at a particular disadvantage compared with white employees in
that the lack of transparency and objective information about performance
fostered an environment where racial prejudices may influence employment

decisions?

9. Did it put the claimant at that disadvantage?

10.If so, was the practice a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?

Victimization

11.Did the claimant do the following act and if so, was it a protected act under

a. On or about 12 January 2023, following a video meeting, the claimant
told his manager Claire Thomson that the way in which Jason White

effect on his own health and safety and on that of the whole team.

b. He submitted a formal written grievance complaining of direct
discrimination and an overall atmosphere of bias and prejudice.
[Claimant’s PH Agenda paragraph S.8(f).]
