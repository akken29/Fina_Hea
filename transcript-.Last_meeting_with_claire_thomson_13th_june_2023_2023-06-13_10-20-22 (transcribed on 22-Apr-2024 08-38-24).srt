1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
 EPC.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,480
 [LAUGHS]

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,080
 OK, yeah, just EPC.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,120
 EPC, EPC, EPC.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,800
 Where did you go?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,840
 Where's it gone?

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,340
 EPC.

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,280
 EPC.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,920
 Yeah.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,800
 So there's a bunch of default.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,680
 So obviously, you get standard VPCs,

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,280
 which is the one that you're using, this AWS VPC.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,880
 But there's this AWS default VPC,

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,200
 which is everything that doesn't have a name is a default one.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,440
 So it handles slightly different so that that's

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
 what they need to be.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,560
 Yeah, so it's basically like Terraform doesn't create

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,200
 the resource, but it adopts any management

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,000
 and a default destroy doesn't.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,880
 You can force destroy things, but you

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,800
 don't need to worry about that now.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
 And you can see that just if you're working again.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 Honestly, every single time I'm like genuinely,

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,240
 so I'll have to log into this.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,080
 Like, oh, god.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,580
 Yeah.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,640
 When we were actually looking at the VPCs--

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,600
 I mean, obviously, you'll have seen that yourself.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,640
 So I mean, if you're just looking at the standard site,

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,160
 it's like VPCs, we've got two.

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,480
 If we go and look at all regions,

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,400
 it does say all the ones that you're trying to capture.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,320
 But when you're actually looking at them,

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,560
 you can see like this one's ac.com/failover.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,640
 It's something that we've created.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 We've given it a name.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,400
 Yeah, yes, indeed.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
 This one under here has got to be dash.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
 Doesn't have a name.

40
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
 But across here, it says yes.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,680
 And this one says no.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,200
 So that's not a default VPC, but this one is.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,360
 So that's like we need to make those default VPCs a default

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,640
 VPC resource.

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,000
 So I think it was from 2020 onwards.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,840
 I think it was--

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
 I'm not going to be able to find it because it did say--

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,440
 does it tell me?

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,200
 Because it told me what it was like from--

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
 it's not going to tell me.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 I think it was like from 2020 onwards.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
 Yeah, so basically, they're just default ones.

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
 So that's why they're all there.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 Just one gets created in every region.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
 Especially if-- I mean, we're not getting paid for it,

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
 charge for it.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 So I don't really know why they do it.

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 And guess just automation in their point.

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
 Because they're all just default ones.

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Guess just automation in their point.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 But yeah, so that's the only thing that only to happen.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
 So if you're happy and you've now figured out

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
 how to get it to work, that's good.

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 So that's basically all I was going to just go through with you

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 is being able to create multiple invider blocks.

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
 But if you've figured that out, that's cool.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 So the only other bit that we'll need to look at

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 is this default VPC.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 OK.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,360
 Can I ask you just one bit of favor?

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 Because as I said, you know, it's--

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
 what I want to do-- now, I just want--

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 I want to propose to do things in two steps.

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 The first step is obviously, as I said,

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 all the other VPCs that are not rewritten

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
 using the format you now have in the testing ground.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
 I want to move all of them there,

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 making sure it is all working.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,360
 And once it is all working as we expected,

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 then I will try to rework the configuration of them

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,360
 using the AWS default VPC, which I showed me.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 Do you think this is a good idea?

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,360
 Yeah, it probably makes sense to do it that way.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,360
 Because you have got it in in front of us,

85
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 and in front of us we wouldn't be touching the other defaults anyway.

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:40,360
 And it should, as I say, be a case of just changing the VPC.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
 Yeah, absolutely.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 Although, in fact, it's in there, the arguments.

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 So that VPC is open.

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,360
 I'm going to give you that one, and there's a standard VPC, AWS VPC.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 Let's hope I just have a look at the difference of them.

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 So basic usage with tags.

93
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 So you've got a default VPC, which has tag name arguments.

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 They first slightly from an AWS VPC.

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,360
 Side or block become an instantaneously arguments come computed attributes.

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 So I don't know if you put these in already?

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
 No, no, no.

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 Yes, I have the side of blocks, but instance tenancy, I don't think so.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 So it looks like once you move across the default, then that side or block goes away.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 And the default value for enabled DNS names is true.

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 So it doesn't look like there's a whole lot.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 I mean, that basically just looks like quite an easy thing to remove out of all of them.

103
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 Force destroy, you don't need to worry about.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 And then I think there's also, because there's obviously bits and pieces that go along with that.

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 I'm pretty sure because you've got default VPC, there are also...

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 Where's all the other bits?

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,360
 Because there's like default VPC, there'll be like default subnet, some things as well that go along with it.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 Yeah, so you get the default subnet.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,360
 So I think they go along.

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 They should go along with it as well.

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 So the default subnets.

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 We won't have any ACLs.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,360
 So I think the only two things you really have is the VPCs and the subnets.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:12,360
 For those other ones, it's just a case of moving across to those resources and deleting the bits that it doesn't need again.

115
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 You'll have probably most of this in it.

116
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 Yeah, so they become computed attributes and you'll take them back out.

117
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
 But yeah, but definitely, yeah.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,360
 So move across to having them all in the right format and in the right folders.

119
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,360
 And then we can worry about switching out the defaults because they're less important than the defaults.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 As long as the Arnold Clark failover and the alien vault ones are working correctly, we can worry about the default ones.

121
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:54,360
 And this default one, is it for...

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:04,360
 Or if we can maybe go a bit up the page, I just want to make sure if it is compatible with 1.3.7 or if it is only with the...

123
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 Okay.

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 Oh, no, that'll be fine. Yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
 Okay, okay.

126
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
 No problem.

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 Yeah, so I mean that's like the question I think.

128
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:22,360
 So I mean that's right up to two hours ago, but it's been around for years.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
 So yeah, you wouldn't have any issues with the version of Teleform.

130
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
 Okay, no problem.

131
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 Okay.

132
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 Sorry, Mato.

133
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
 I'm like, can you hear her?

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,360
 People say they can't hear I'm like, no, you must be able to...

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 SESCO!

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:48,500
 No, no, no, no. No, no, no. The dog is not the problem. It is rather myself. As I said, I haven't slept much yesterday night. So I'm a bit there.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,840
 I'm slightly I'm slightly in the clouds today. It's not the dog.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:03,000
 No, no, I'm just like I just feel like I'm constantly tired. I've got the dog within all day, so I just get a headache. And then the tiny man's been getting up during the night. So just feel like I'm like.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,940
 I'm sorry. I'm a bit more grumpy than I normally am and a bit more sure. So I apologize. So but yeah. But yeah, so if if it is the case again, and it's like I know I'm going to go back to it.

140
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:24,600
 It's like if if we do tell you to do it in a certain format and in a certain way, it's like we're not telling you that to be difficult.

141
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:44,600
 And it's like because we know it can be done. So in which it can be because you went away and figured it out. But yeah, and if you're running any problems, and where I've asked you to do something in a certain way and it's not working, then please, please, please, just like pick up the phone or send me a message

142
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 and just go and this isn't work. If you get two minutes just have a wee look. We've got a team to work with. There's there's like a bunch of us. And we've all we've all got experience in different areas and stuff.

143
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 And like just asking the question early on if we're getting stuck with something means that you don't end up doing lots of work that you don't need to like with it.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 And then you're going to have to go back and fix it all again. So if we'd caught that early if we just ask him, go this isn't working. Like, are you sure this is what you want to do?

145
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 And we've to be able to sort of like.

146
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 I would have asked on Friday. I think unfortunately on Friday I realized you were not in in the afternoon. So this is why I was okay. I sat down and I thought to myself, okay, when I'm putting all of them in one folder, it is not working.

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 So I did my research.

148
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 There's not only me though. I mean, it's like, I know obviously like sometimes you don't want to necessarily do something. But it's like, he is good and he knows what he's talking about.

149
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 Like, it's like, I mean, Zoe was Zoe was on Friday. And he's like a terraform wizard. So I don't know how much experience he has. Obviously Greg doesn't have masses of mine. So he's on the terraform journey as well.

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 But yeah, we are here. And like to ask, even if you don't want to talk to Jason, this is ping him a message. He would have suggested using using multiple provider blocks. And then we wouldn't have ended up having to say we the Royal week is you're doing the work.

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 And having to redo it again. But that's we have a team of people we need to work as a team and be able to actually ask each other. And you don't have to like us.

152
00:11:41,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 But we had a team play. Please use your team and ask questions. Just just to be absolutely clear. I have and I'm sure you know, you know that I have absolutely no issue whatsoever with you know, you Zoe or even Greg or any other person.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 It is just that, you know, I was I was obviously and I know you write you write but on Friday I really thought about, you know, pulling you into to see to see if you could help me but you were not in and I was thinking to myself.

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 Okay, the others are also dealing with their own and task and their own problems. So let me try to figure out. So this is why I spent some time working.

155
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 But that's that's why we end up just going around for days. It's like, honestly, it's like everybody's got stuff on. I send people messages all day every day. And so you'll send me messages and you might not see it in the chat chat.

156
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Yeah, sending messages on the sides just like and like, there'll be times I'll do something and it's like, I've went down a route and I'm like, this seems mental is this mental.

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 And I'll just fire Zoe a message when this seems mental is not working. Like what do you think? Or we'll just pick up the phone. And it like we, yeah, we all do have our own bits of work.

158
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 But see that doesn't mean that we don't talk to each other in the background or spend five, 10, 10 minutes or in cases we mean Jason because we talk a lot we end up like just blabber nonsense for an hour in the background about other things.

159
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 Because that's how it ends up being like this. That's that is there's a team of us. And you use your team have a chat.

160
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 And yeah, we don't have to work alone. We should we don't need to work alone.

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 Okay, okay, fine. Okay. Cool. Okay. So right, it looks like we're on the right track. So all into one file and into the correct folders get rid of all the sub folders and change the resources.

162
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 And then hopefully that shouldn't take too long. So I'm going to I'm going to estimate Thursday Thursday PR reviews. Yeah, yeah, that should be that should be more than that.

163
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:13,600
 Hopefully, and you can show us the PR and it'll be all nice and a nice shiny just in the AWS folder. And it'll look cool and it will work and it'll be great.

164
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 And if you do run into any more issues, then yes, we are here. Please ask questions.

165
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 No, there are no daft questions. I asked that. In fairness, I asked that questions all the time. But nobody wins at me for it.

166
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 They'll just laugh at me and go, that's stupid. And I know which is fine. It's okay. It's okay. Just ask questions.

167
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 That's what we're here for. Okay. Okay. And sorry for having to listen to my dog. So I will let I will let you know.

168
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 No, no, no, the dog is not a problem at all.

169
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 The dog is a problem. It's also a problem for me.

170
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 And if the dog is causing too much issues, just feel free to send him on on on vacation here.

171
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 I'll be more than happy.

172
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 Oh, honestly, she was a bit. Have you got a nice garden? Have you got a nice garden?

173
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 I would love it. Yeah.

174
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 Well, if there is there is a rather large garden and there is also a forest nearby.

175
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 So, you know, she would love it. She would never come home.

176
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 Oh dear. I don't know. Poor, poor big dog. Right.

177
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 I'm going to do I've been I've been using the tiny humans dinosaurs and putting them because we've got a table at the window.

178
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 So she can jump up on the table to look out the window. The windows all sketch because she's basically sketched out it.

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,600
 But she she I've been trying to put his dinosaurs on the table to try and stop her from jumping up on it to bark.

180
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,600
 It's not really it's not really working. It's not working. It's not working.

181
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 So, bless bless her. It's not her fault. She's she's an old she's an old lady.

182
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 All she wants to do is just relax and sleep comes comes nighttime.

183
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 She just crashes out and just does not move because she's so tired because normally all she would do is sleep during the day and now she's not getting any sleep.

184
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 So she's not getting any sleep. I'm getting a headache and everybody's grumpy.

185
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 So it's frankly, I mean, what I've just said, I know it sounds very unusual.

186
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 I know it does sound very unusual. But I used to have when I was when I was younger, like, you know, back in the days,

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 I used to live in a well, my dad used to have a house where we had something like a mini zoo.

188
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 Like, like we had many type of animals you wouldn't even believe believe someone could have in his house.

189
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 So, you know, I've been taking care of animals for some time.

190
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 So if the dog needs some vacations and some vacations somewhere, honestly, it's not a problem at all.

191
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 Oh, bless. Oh, people, people questions questions.

192
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
 Right. OK, somebody else is asking me questions right.

193
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 So I'm going to jump off. I have PR reviews on the background.

194
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 I don't know if I've started. I might jump on that.

195
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 Is anybody there?

196
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 And if you do run into any more issues, please ask.

197
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 Don't suffer in silence.

198
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 Even if you don't want to talk to Jason, he's fine by chat.

199
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 Just fine by chat.

200
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 You're generally better in chat than by voice.

201
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 It's fine.

202
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 And so he's always here as well.

203
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 So just like, even in Friday, even on Friday, see if you just ping me a message.

204
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 It's like, I know I'm not working, but like, I would still be able to answer you.

205
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 It's like, do keep an eye on messages. So, yeah, do just contact me instead of worrying and going down the wrong route again.

206
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,600
 Okay, so I will catch you in a bit and I'll go and see these messages and jump on the other call.

207
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 Thank you very much.

208
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 Okay, catch you later.

209
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 Bye.
