Foreword to the first edition
The Hon Mrs Justice Cox DBE
When, as a law student, I first developed an interest in the law governing
employment relationships, that law was to be found secreted away in the
standard contract textbooks under the quaint heading: ‘The Law relating to
Master and Servant’. The right not to be unfairly dismissed had yet to enter
the statute books; and the process of revolutionising what had hitherto been
an entirely contractual relationship was just about to begin.
Now, some 35 years later, employment law is threatening to drown us all
in the sea of case law and legislation, both domestic and European, that it
has become. Employment tribunals too have moved well away from their
original concept as a straightforward, cost-free system for the speedy
resolution of employment disputes, to the modern, sophisticated arena they
have become for determining what are often cases involving inordinate
factual and legal complexity. There are now new and complex procedural
regulations governing the conduct of the increasing number of cases which
come before them.
Yet, as we struggle to keep up with all this, we can lose sight of the fact
that the art of running a claim in the tribunal, and knowing how best,
tactically, to prepare for and conduct a hearing, involve skills which are just
as important as a sound knowledge of the substantive law and procedure.
Given our adversarial process, they are skills which can make all the
difference to winning or losing a case. Intimate knowledge of how tribunals
work, the art of writing good letters, where to look for the relevant law, how
and when to press for disclosure, effective use of the questionnaire
procedure, deciding which witnesses to call or, sometimes more

importantly, not to call, knowing how to present good arguments in closing
a case, negotiating a beneficial settlement, settling grounds of appeal from
an adverse decision – the list is endless; and each of them is a vital
component in the weaponry of an employment adviser.
How useful therefore, to be able to reach for a book like this and find, all
in one place, sensible and realistic guidance on every conceivable aspect of
employment litigation. This text, as its title suggests, marks a change from
the Legal Action Group practitioner texts now so familiar to those who
work in the various LAG specialist areas. It concentrates on the practical
and the tactical and, in my view, neatly fills a gap in the employment
adviser’s library, where information and advice of this kind, on this scale
and in this format has not previously been accessible.
The author observes that this book is aimed primarily at those unqualified
or part-qualified employment advisers; but it will in my view be extremely
attractive to a far wider audience, including the busy, the newly qualified
and indeed the not so newly qualified employment practitioner, when
advising or appearing for either employees or employers.
The real value of this text lies in the straightforward and comprehensive
advice it provides; and in its success in demystifying the legal process and
lawyers’ jargon. We lawyers, so familiar with the terminology of our
discipline, tend to forget how perplexing it can be to those outside our
sheltered world. A tribunal Chairman, once giving directions to
unrepresented litigants on how to prepare for a hearing and referring to the
need for ‘skeleton arguments’ was met, predictably, by the question from
one of them, ‘do you mean thin?’
Most useful of all perhaps is the comprehensive collection of precedents,
those important documents which have already stood someone in good
stead and can therefore confidently be used by the novice, the busy or the
less experienced adviser, to whom they will become real friends.
The author is to be congratulated for producing what will undoubtedly
become a most helpful, informative and well-used resource for those
working in one of the most dynamic and fascinating areas of the law.

Introduction
This book grew out of a file of precedents created for volunteers at the Free
Representation Unit (FRU) where we have both worked, training and
supervising volunteer employment tribunal representatives.1 We have also,
at different times, been FRU volunteers ourselves. FRU volunteers are
typically postgraduate law students, pupil barristers or trainee solicitors
who come to the organisation with little or no prior knowledge of
employment law and practice. They found a broad collection of precedents
reassuring when taking their first steps in employment tribunal litigation,
and that suggested that a similar collection might be of use to other nonspecialist, unqualified or part-qualified advisers and to lay people
representing themselves in the employment tribunals.
This book was conceived as little more than the original collection of
sample documents, supported by footnotes and short sections of
explanatory text. The explanatory text grew in the writing of the first
edition, and has become the core of the book. Much of this, too, reflects
experience drawn from FRU. Volunteers grappling with a difficult legal
problem have a wealth of specialist law reports, text books and articles to
rely on. Guidance on softer questions – questions about the ‘feel’ of the
process, how a tribunal is likely to react to a particular application, how to
go about structuring a cross-examination, where to pitch the next offer in a
negotiation, etc – is much harder to find in written form. One of the main
aims of this book is to fill that gap. We do not set out the substantive or
procedural law except as necessary to place the precedents and tactical
guidance in their context.2

Although the book is primarily written with claimants acting for
themselves and unqualified or part-qualified advisers in mind, we hope that
it will also prove useful to lawyers who only occasionally practise in
employment law, and to specialist employment lawyers early in their
careers. The focus of the book, true to its origins, is on the conduct of
proceedings by or on behalf of employees, but most of the text is applicable
to both sides and many of the precedents could be used with minor
adaptations by employers and their advisers.

Aims of the book
Employment tribunals and the lawyers who appear in them have their own
habits and expectations. Judges can behave as if these were self-explanatory
when, to an outsider or a beginner, they are not. One particular source of
difficulty for the non-lawyer operating in employment tribunals comes –
ironically – from efforts to make the process informal and non-legalistic.
The tribunal system is supposed to provide a quick, cheap and informal
process; procedure rules are expressed in non-technical language, and
everything is supposed to be plain and straightforward.
The problem with this is that the whole structure is still dominated by
lawyers. Employment judges are trained lawyers, as are very many of those
who represent claimants and respondents before them. The employment
tribunal rules are in many ways a simplified version of the rules that apply
in the ordinary courts, many of which have literally centuries of
development and case law behind them. The result is that the employment
tribunal procedure rules look very different from the perspective of a nonlawyer who simply reads the words and tries to work out what they mean,
than from the perspective of a lawyer who instinctively compares them to
the rules he or she is familiar with in other legal contexts. Tribunal judges
may throw up their hands in horror at what they see as a basic failure of
good practice or tribunal etiquette, and claimants acting in person or
inexperienced advisers can sometimes be made to feel that the process – for
all its supposed informality – is in fact a minefield of obscure unwritten
rules and embarrassing unexpected howlers.3
A key aim of this book is to alert users to the unwritten rules and guide
them in the art of staying on the right side of the decision-making body. A

subsidiary aim is to encourage inexperienced advisers not to let the
occasional ‘telling off’ in the course of the hearing alarm them unduly:
although you can probably conclude that you are doing something wrong if
you are in constant hot water with the tribunal, it is in the nature of the job –
certainly if you are an adviser – that properly looking after your clients’
interests does sometimes mean opposing what the tribunal wants to do, and
standing your ground under fire. Beginners in the field should also take
courage from the thought that all practitioners learn by their mistakes.
Where we warn against any specific error, there is a decent chance that one
of us has bravely road-tested it for you.4

Structure of the book
The book is divided into chapters that broadly follow the sequence of
employment tribunal proceedings. Each chapter aims to give practical
guidance on the stage of proceedings discussed, to alert users to unwritten
rules, conventional practice and pit-falls, and to give them insights into the
likely thought processes of the tribunal and the other parties. Sample
pleadings, letters and other documents appear throughout each chapter to
illustrate the points made. These are given numbers that correspond to the
preceding paragraph number: so, for example, a precedent following
paragraph 3.7 will be P3.7; if two precedents follow one after the other at
that point, they will be numbered P3.7.1 and P3.7.2. Occasionally where it
seems useful to show the structure of the document before giving a sample,
there will be what we have called a ‘document outline’. These are
numbered similarly. As for the perennial problem of a neutral pronoun, we
have chosen to use ‘she’ and ‘he’ in alternate chapters. Both should be
taken to mean ‘he or she.’

The precedents
The collection of precedents deliberately makes no attempt at
comprehensiveness. Its aim is to demonstrate techniques and tactics through
examples rather than to provide a precedent for every occasion. For this
reason it is both broader and shallower than its closest comparators. It is
shallower in that it offers a relatively small range of examples of formal

employment tribunal pleadings and makes no attempt to illustrate all the
kinds of complaint that can be brought to an employment tribunal.5 It is
broader in that it does offer a greater range of kinds of documents than is
usual – correspondence with the respondent and the tribunal, written
submissions, cross-examination notes, chronologies, draft directions, etc, as
well as formal employment tribunal pleadings. The intention is not to
persuade users that they should depend on a precedent for everything. On
the contrary, the intention is to provide enough examples to give users the
confidence to draft their own documents flexibly and responsively.
Precedents, like water-wings, have only finished their job when their users
discard them.
We illustrate our points wherever possible by reference to two main cases
– those of Saifur Rahman and Pauline Phelps – which we follow from the
claim, through interlocutory applications, the hearing, and appeals. The aim
is to allow the reader to understand the points we make without having to
come to grips with a new set of facts for each precedent.
There remain some individual precedents and examples that cannot
without artificiality be incorporated into either Miss Phelps’ or Mr
Rahman’s stories, so as well as the two main characters, there are several
‘walk on’ parts. These are particularly prevalent in the chapter on
negotiation and settlement: we want Mr Rahman and Miss Phelps to
illustrate various points about hearings and appeals, so it would not do at all
to settle their cases at chapter 6.
All names are fictional. Where documents are adapted from real cases,
other details have also been changed to preserve anonymity. Letters are
written in the names of Natalie Cummings and Malcolm Rhodes, alter-egos
of the authors, who practise employment law from the imaginary North
London Law Centre. Curiously, all the respondents with whom Ms
Cummings and Mr Rhodes deal are represented by the same George Bean
of Carrot & Marrow Solicitors in Islington. Even more curiously, a series of
computer glitches in the tribunal service have assigned all their cases the
same number, 123456/09.

courage and enthusiasm are a continuing source of inspiration; also to
Michael Gleeson and Nigel Duncan who provided detailed and invaluable
comments during preparation of the first edition. Finally to Anne Fairpo, for
baking, and for expert advice on the application of tax law to employment
litigation; and to Tim Pitt-Payne, who first suggested the book and whose
experience and insights have informed it throughout.

2 For an accessible guide to employment law, see Tamara Lewis, Employment Law: an adviser’s
handbook (ELAH) (10th edn, Legal Action Group, 2013); for a much more detailed and technical
treatment, see Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law (Butterworths, looseleaf).
Butterworths Employment Law Handbook (21st edn, Butterworths, 2013) edited by Peter Wallington
is a comprehensive collection of employment legislation.
3 For example: in one hearing, the tribunal judge was heard to bark at an unrepresented employer,
repeatedly and with rising irritation, ‘Don’t lead the witness!’ The employer clearly had no idea what
this meant, but was too rattled to ask – and so carried on asking leading questions until the claimant’s
representative intervened to suggest that it might be better if the judge explained what he meant by
‘leading’ and why it was unhelpful.
4 Long ago, of course.

Glossary
The purpose of this glossary is to provide non-technical working definitions
for the terms in common use in the employment tribunals that are most
likely to give non-lawyers difficulty. Many of these terms are explained at
greater length in the main text of this book; some are defined by statute, and
this glossary is no substitute for considering the language of the statutory
definition.
ACAS
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service: the statutory body that has a
duty to attempt to bring about the settlement of employment tribunal
disputes see conciliation.
actual dismissal
Dismissal where the employer has terminated the contract of employment:
contrasted with constructive dismissal, where the employee has resigned in
response to the employer’s fundamental breach of the contract of
employment.
additional information
Further details of the claim or response provided at the request of the
opposing party.
adjournment
A hearing is said to be adjourned if after it has begun it is put off to another
day, or to later in the same day.
affidavit

A formal sworn statement used in legal proceedings. An affidavit has to be
sworn in front of a solicitor or barrister.
affirm
1. An employee is said to affirm her contract of employment if, after the
employer has committed a fundamental breach of contract, she acts in a
way that implies that she intends to keep the contract alive. This deprives
her of the right to resign and complain of constructive dismissal.
2. Before giving evidence a witness must either swear an oath to tell the
truth (on a holy book of his or her choice), or affirm, that is, make a solemn
non-religious promise to tell the truth.
appellant
The party – whether the employer or the employee – who appeals against a
decision.
attendance note
A file note recording what was said at a meeting or in the course of a
telephone conversation.
authorities
Previously decided cases relied on by a party in support of its arguments.
bundle
The papers prepared for use at a hearing – for example, a bundle of
documents, a bundle of authorities, etc – usually paginated, indexed, and
held together securely (for example, with a treasury tag or in a lever arch
file).
burden of proof
The party that has the job of persuading the tribunal that its assertions on
any issue are correct is said to bear the burden of proof on that issue. For
example: a claimant who says that she was dismissed for raising health and
safety issues must show that this was the reason for her dismissal if she is to
succeed in her unfair dismissal claim, and so if the tribunal cannot decide
what was the reason for her dismissal she fails. If her employer says that
she has failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate her loss, however, it is for
the employer to show that that is true: it is not for her to show that she has
done everything she reasonably could.

case management discussion
A hearing before a chairman at which procedural arrangements for the
hearing are made.
case-law
Previously decided cases that establish points of principle law derived from
that source as opposed to legislation.
cast list
A list of the individuals involved in the events on which the claim is based.
chairman
The lawyer who presides over an employment tribunal hearing see also
wing member.
chronology
A list of key events, with dates, in date order.
claim
1. The document by which the claimant starts employment tribunal
proceedings.
2. The subject-matter of the claimant’s case.
claimant
The individual who brings the claim to the employment tribunal.
comparator
In a discrimination case, the claimant may say that the employer treated
someone else more favourably than him or her in comparable
circumstances. This other person is referred to as the comparator.
Comparators may be actual or hypothetical: often the allegation is not that a
real other person was better treated, but that another person with the same
characteristics as the claimant except for his or her race (or sex, or religious
belief, etc) would have been better treated.
conciliation
The attempt (usually by ACAS) to bring about a negotiated settlement of
the claim.
consolidate

To link two (or more) related cases so that they are heard together.
constructive dismissal
Resignation in response to a fundamental breach of contract by the
employer, which is treated as dismissal for the purposes of unfair dismissal
protection. Compare actual dismissal.
contributory fault
Culpable conduct by an employee that has contributed to his or her
dismissal, relied on by the employer as a reason to reduce compensation.
costs order
An order that one party should pay the other a sum of money representing
some or all of the legal fees that the second party has incurred in the case
(expenses order in Scotland). See also preparation time order.
COT3
The form on which an ACAS officer records a settlement.
cross-examination
Questioning of a witness in order to undermine the case of the party who
called the witness, or to discredit the witness’s evidence.
culpable
Deserving blame.
declaration
A remedy that may be given by a court or tribunal. A declaration is a
formal, binding statement about the legal rights of a party.
direct discrimination
Treating a person unfavourably on a prohibited ground, for example,
because of his or her race, sex etc. See also indirect discrimination.
directions hearing
The old term for a case management discussion.
directions
Orders issued by the tribunal as to the procedural aspects of the case – for
example, as to disclosure of documents, exchange of witness statements,
bundles of documents, etc.

disclosure
The process by which one party tells the other party what relevant
documents it has, and/or provides copies of them.
discovery
The old term for disclosure.
discretion
A decision-maker is said to have a discretion if it has a choice between
different courses of action that is not governed by a fixed rule but instead
requires consideration of all the circumstances. For example, a tribunal that
has found that an employer has made unauthorised deductions from the
claimant’s wages must order the employer to pay the sum deducted – it has
no discretion as to whether or not to do so. By contrast, a tribunal that
considers that a claimant’s case was misconceived has the power to order
him or her to pay some or all of the respondent’s costs: but it has a wide
discretion whether to make a costs order, and if so how much to order the
claimant to pay.
discrimination by way of victimisation
Treating an employee unfavourably because he or she has made a complaint
of discrimination (or helped another person to do so). For example, it is
discrimination by way of victimisation to dismiss a woman because she has
complained of sex discrimination. To an employment lawyer,
‘victimisation’ is a technical term meaning this kind of discrimination. So a
claim that uses the word in its non-technical sense of bullying or
harassment is likely to prompt a request for additional information seeking
confirmation that no form of discrimination is alleged.
distinguish
An argument that the tribunal need not follow a previously decided case
because it is different in some material respect from the case before them is
referred to as distinguishing the earlier case: see paragraph 1.88.
effective date of termination
The day on which the employment terminated, often important for
calculating time limits for presenting a claim.
Employment Appeal Tribunal

The body that hears appeals from the employment tribunals.
ET1
The form (otherwise referred to as the claim) by which the claimant starts
tribunal proceedings.
ET3
The form (otherwise referred to as the response) on which the respondent
responds to the claim.
evidence in chief
The main body of evidence given by a witness – usually by way of a
witness statement – before cross-examination by or on behalf of the
opposing party.
examination in chief
Asking questions of your own witness.
expeditious
Prompt.
extempore
Reasons or a judgment are said to have been given extempore if given
straight away at the end of the hearing compare reserved.
floating
Sometimes, on arrival at tribunal on the hearing day, the parties are told that
the starting time for their hearing has not been fixed but that their case will
be heard once a tribunal or chairman becomes free. In this situation the case
is said to be floating.
further particulars
The old term for additional information.
hearsay evidence
Evidence given by a witness of a statement made by another person, given
for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement. See paragraph
4.53 for an example.
indirect discrimination

In general, applying a rule or practice that is on its face neutral as between
different groups, but that imposes a disproportionate and unjustified
disadvantage on members of one race, sex, etc. Applying the same
minimum height requirement to male and female job applicants, for
example, would usually be unlawful on grounds of indirect discrimination,
unless justified by the requirements of the job.
inference
A conclusion drawn from established facts.
interlocutory
Preliminary and/or procedural
issues
The questions on which the parties disagree, and which the tribunal will
have to decide on.
judgment
The tribunal’s final determination of an issue or the issues in the case.
leading question
A question that indicates the answer expected. Leading questions are
generally allowed in cross-examination but not – except on uncontroversial
matters – in examination in chief. Hence, representatives may be told by the
tribunal not to ‘lead’ their own witnesses.
Legal Aid Agency
The body that administers public funding for legal advice and
representation.
legalese
Obscure or pompous language used by lawyers to enhance their
importance/mystery/fees.
legislation
Law that is set out in Acts of Parliament or regulations (or comparable
European instruments) as opposed to being derived from previously decided
cases.
liability

What courts or tribunals have to decide is often divided into questions about
liability – that is, whether a legal wrong has been done to the claimant – and
questions about remedy – that is what is to be done about it.
limitation period
The period within which a claim must be brought.
liquidated damages
A sum agreed between the parties to a contract to be payable in the event of
breach (or a certain defined breach) by one party, provided that the sum
represents a genuine attempt to value the loss or damage that would be
caused to the innocent party by the breach. If it is simply an arbitrary sum
intended to coerce full compliance with the terms of the contract, then it is a
penalty clause and unenforceable.
listing
The process of fixing a date for a hearing.
litigant in person
A party representing themselves in a case.
misconceived
Having no foundation, or no reasonable prospect of success.
mitigation
The process by which a claimant reduces the amount she has lost (by reason
of dismissal, discrimination, etc) by her own efforts – for example, by
getting another job.
notice of appearance
The old term for the response or ET3.
open
Correspondence or a meeting is said to be open if it is not without
prejudice.
order
An instruction by the tribunal that requires a person or party to do
something.
organogram

A chart showing an organisation’s structure.
originating application
The old term for the claim or ET1.
party
A claimant or respondent: the persons whose rights and obligations are to
be decided in the proceedings.
penalty clause
A clause in a contract that imposes a disproportionate financial penalty on
one party for breach of the contract in order to coerce that party into strict
compliance: for example, a clause in a contract of employment that
provided that an hour’s pay would be docked for every five minutes by
which the employee arrived late. Penalty clauses are unenforceable, but see
liquidated damages.
pleadings
The old term for statements of case.
postponement
Putting off a hearing to another date.
precedent
1. A decided case that establishes a point of principle to be followed in
other cases in the future.
2. A document intended as an example of how to draft documents of the
particular kind demonstrated.
pre-hearing review
A hearing that takes place before the main or substantive hearing, usually
before a chairman alone, in order to decide preliminary matters.
prejudice
Disadvantage. Exercises of the tribunal’s case management discretion – eg
whether or not to postpone a hearing – will often depend partly or wholly
on the ‘balance of prejudice’ between the parties: for example, whether the
disadvantage to Party A in having the hearing put off is greater or less than
the disadvantage to Party B in having to go ahead without a particular who
cannot attend on the date originally set.

preparation time order
An order that one party pay the other a sum of money representing the time
they have spent preparing the case, available in place of a costs order if the
receiving party has not been legally represented.
privilege
A document is said to be privileged if it does not have to be disclosed to the
other party despite being relevant. The rule that the content of without
prejudice negotiations must not be disclosed to the tribunal is also a variety
of privilege.
pro bono
Short for ‘pro bono publico’ (Latin): for the public good, used by lawyers to
describe work done for free.
promulgate
Legalese for ‘send out’.
quantum
Latin for ‘how much,’ used as legal shorthand for the amount that the claim
is worth. See also liability, remedy.
questionnaire
A list of questions that a claimant or potential claimant in a discrimination
case can serve on the other party.
re-engagement
A remedy for unfair dismissal: the claimant must be re-employed in a job
comparable to his or her old job.
reinstatement
A remedy for unfair dismissal: the claimant must be given his or her old job
back.
remedy
What the claimant gets from the respondent if she is successful in her claim.
By far the most common remedy awarded by employment tribunals is
compensation, but other remedies are available in some cases: for example,
a declaration, reinstatement or re-engagement. See also ‘liability’.

repudiation
Fundamental breach of contract: an employer or employee who has acted in
fundamental breach of the contract of employment is said to have
repudiated it.
reserved decision
A decision that is not given on the day of the hearing but at a later date.
respondent
1. The party against whom a claim is made.
2. In an appeal, the party resisting the appeal.
response
The respondent’s answer to the claim.
review
The process by which the tribunal may revisit its own decision and, if it
thinks fit, revoke or vary it.
serve
If a document is required to be ‘served’ on someone, it must be sent or
given to them.
skeleton argument
A written summary of the arguments that a party will put forward at a
hearing.
statement of truth
An assertion, contained in a witness statement, that the contents of it are
true.
statements of case
In the employment tribunals, the claim and response (often still referred to
as pleadings).
statute
Act of Parliament.
subject access request
A request under the Data Protection Act 1998 for personal data.

submissions
The points made by a party or his or her representative to persuade the
tribunal to find in his or her favour.
substantive
Relating to the substance of the claim, rather than to procedural or
interlocutory matters.
‘Tomlin’ order
An order staying proceedings while the terms of a settlement are put into
effect.
whistleblowing
The familiar name for making a protected disclosure.
wing member
An employment tribunal is made up of a chairman, who is legally qualified,
and two wing members. The wing members need not be, and are usually
not, legally qualified, but they will have relevant experience, for example,
as trade unionists or personnel managers.
without prejudice
The phrase used to indicate that a letter or conversation is directed to
achieving a settlement and is therefore not to be disclosed to the tribunal.
witness statement
The written account of the evidence given by a witness. In England and
Wales it forms the basis of that witness’s evidence in chief and may be read
aloud by the witness or taken as read. In Scotland, witness statements are
not used: evidence in chief is given orally.

1.149 How likely are you to get it?
1.151 What you have to do

Read this first: time limits
1.1
If you think you might want to bring a claim in the employment tribunal,
the very first thing you need to know is how long you have to decide. Do
you have to get your claim in today or tomorrow, or have you got a few
weeks or even a month or two to think about it?
1.2

A significant number of claimants lose their claims because they miss the
comparatively short deadlines involved in tribunal claims. Even if a late
claim is allowed to proceed – which is the exception rather than the rule –
getting it back in will involve stress and delay.
1.3
This means that it is important to consider the time limit immediately and
to err on the side of caution. Do not regard the deadline as a target. Once
you have decided to bring a claim, try to do so immediately. Even if you
need to delay a little, aim to have the claim lodged at least a few weeks
before the deadline. This will protect you from errors in calculating the
deadline and give you a margin of safety if anything goes wrong.

Interim relief: claim within 7 days of dismissal
1.4
If you think you’ve been dismissed because of trade union activities, or for
making a protected disclosure, or for a number of other specific prohibited
reasons, you may be able to ask the tribunal for ‘interim relief’. Interim
relief is very valuable, because it stops the dismissal taking effect (at least
so far as your wages are concerned) until after the tribunal has decided your
unfair dismissal claim. The catch is that you have to apply for it within 7
days of dismissal. If you don’t, you may still have a claim for unfair
dismissal – but you won’t get interim relief.
1.5
So if you’re reading this within a few days of having been dismissed, you
need to work out whether you have a possible claim for interim relief. If
you do, and you want to take advantage of it, you’re going to need to move
very fast indeed.
1.6
There is guidance on what you need to do to apply for interim relief at
para 1.144 below.

Other cases: 3 months plus the conciliation period
1.7
From some time in early 2014, other claims will be complicated by the
introduction of a requirement to notify the Advisory, Conciliation and

Arbitration Service (ACAS) of a claim, and wait for a while to give ACAS
the opportunity to see if they can bring about a settlement, before presenting
a claim to the tribunal. This is called the ‘early conciliation period’. Bear in
mind that at the time of writing this book, compulsory early conciliation is
not yet in force, and the detail of the scheme could still change. We’ll put
information about any changes on the blog that supports this book:
www.etclaims.co.uk.
1.8
There’s detailed guidance about compulsory early conciliation at paras
2.1–2.25 below. But what you need to do urgently is work out what the
basic time limit is for presenting your claim so that you know whether you
are close to it.
1.9
Most claims are about dismissal, one way or another. If you are
complaining of unfair dismissal, or that your dismissal was an act of
unlawful discrimination, the basic time limit is 3 months less one day from
the last day of your employment. The last day of your employment is
normally the last day you attended work, or the day you were told that you
were dismissed, whichever is later. So, for example, if you were dismissed
on 26 February 2014, you need to take the first step in your claim on or
before 25 May 2014.
1.10
But if you also want to complain about things that were done before your
employment ended, you will mostly have 3 months less one day from the
date of the act or omission in question. So, for example, if you applied for a
promotion and didn’t get it because of your sex or race, you will need to
take steps to start your claim 3 months less a day, at the latest, from the day
on which the decision was taken.
1.11
Discrimination claims can present difficulties as there will often be
allegations about a number of discriminatory acts on different dates.
Sometimes it will be possible to argue that these all form part of the same
continuing act, but that argument can be complicated. The safest course is
to treat the normal time limit as expiring three months after the earliest of
the acts that you want to complain about. Of course, this may well be
impossible – because you have put up with mistreatment for weeks, months

or sometimes years before you decide that you have to start employment
tribunal proceedings. If that’s the case, then once you have made that
decision, you need to present your claim as soon as you possibly can.
1.12
Multiple claims (in the sense of cases where the claimant has a number of
different complaints against the employer) are very common: they are
probably the rule rather than the exception. Most complaints about
dismissal are accompanied by a wages claim, or a contract claim; many are
accompanied by a discrimination claim as well. Discrimination claims may
be against both the employer and the individual colleague who has
discriminated.
1.13
Give careful thought to what the relevant limitation period is for each
claim separately. Sometimes the periods will coincide or overlap, but you
can’t assume they will all be the same.
1.14
If you have worked out your basic limitation period, and it ends very
soon – say today or tomorrow – what do you need to do? That depends
whether or not early conciliation is in force yet.
1.15
If early conciliation is in force, you need to submit an early conciliation
request to ACAS. Here early conciliation helps you, because submitting the
request to ACAS will be easy. And having done that, you can breathe again:
you’ve got until a month after ACAS sends you your certificate of early
conciliation to present your claim to the employment tribunal.
1.16
If early conciliation isn’t in force, you need to present your claim at once.
See para 2.90 for guidance on how to draft a short claim that will be
sufficiently informative to start your claim.

Read this second: whether to bring a claim
1.17
Now that you have worked out how soon you need to start your claim if
you’re going to, you can turn your mind to whether you should. If you’re

right up against the deadline, submit an early conciliation request to ACAS
anyway, and then decide whether you want to take it further.
1.18
For a lawyer, the question whether a claim should be brought is normally
approached by way of three questions:
what are the prospects of success?
how much compensation will be awarded (or what other benefit will it
bring) if it succeeds? and
what will it cost to run?
1.19
The prospects of success of any given case will depend entirely on its own
facts, but it is possible to make some general remarks about the questions of
ultimate benefit, and cost.

How much will I get if I win?
1.20
People bring claims for many reasons. Money is rarely the only motive, and
often not the most important one. All the same, this is one of the questions
you should ask before you start employment tribunal proceedings. The
answer depends on the type of claim and a whole host of other specific
circumstances. This book is not about how to calculate damages in the
employment tribunal, although some practical advice is given in chapter 10.
1.21
But it is useful to say something about how tribunals approach awarding
money and how much, on average, people get.
1.22
In most cases, the idea will be to compensate you for what you’ve lost
because of the unlawful conduct that forms the basis of your claim. There
are exceptions, but they tend to involve fairly small sums. If your
employment has ended, your main argument will be about lost earnings. If
your claim is for discrimination, you will be making a claim for injury to
feelings as well: most awards will be of a few thousand pounds and awards
over £25,000 are rare. If discrimination has caused significant injury to your
health, you will be looking for an award for that, too: your starting point in

assessing this is probably the Judicial Studies Board’s Guidelines for the
assessment of general damages in personal injury cases.1
1.23
In any case where you are claiming lost earnings because you have lost
your job, you will be under a duty to ‘mitigate’ your loss. What that means
is that just because you’ve been dismissed, however unfair (or
discriminatory) the dismissal, you can’t expect to sit back and claim lost
earnings until your retirement age. You are expected to try to find another
job. If there are good reasons why you can’t, or why any job you are likely
to get will be for a much lower wage than you were earning before, you’ll
need to be able to explain why. You will also need evidence, and you should
start collecting that evidence as soon as you decide to bring your claim (see
para 10.37). It’s fairly rare that tribunals award compensation to cover more
than a year or two’s lost earnings – a few months’ is more usual. There’s
now a limit of a year’s pay (or £74,200 if you earn more than that in a year)
on what you can recover as compensation for most types of unfair
dismissal. There’s no limit in theory to what you can get for discrimination
or for a whistle-blowing dismissal, but that doesn’t mean that awards have
to be huge.
1.24
In 2012/13, the median award for unfair dismissal was £4,832. Don’t let
newspaper reports of awards in the hundreds of thousands, or even millions,
give you the wrong idea. Tribunals do occasionally make very large awards
in discrimination cases – and those, of course, are the ones that hit the
headlines – but they are rare.2 The best way of getting a huge award is to
have an extremely well-paid job to start with: if you’re being paid in the
hundreds of thousands every year, then you’ll clock up large losses in a
short period out of work. If you’re earning a normal salary, you won’t get a
large award unless your claim is of a kind to which the unfair dismissal
compensation limit doesn’t apply and you can show that you are likely to
suffer a very long period of future loss. Because of the duty to mitigate,
that’s usually difficult.

How much will it cost to run?
1.25

You need to consider this question carefully from all angles. The question
how much money will need to be spent on the claim is, of course, an
important one. Even if you are acting for yourself, or are lucky enough to
have free representation, there will be financial costs: the biggest cost is
likely to be tribunal fees, but you’ll also have to factor in travel, telephone
calls, postage, photocopying, fees for expert reports, etc. But you should
think hard about the non-financial costs of running a case against your
former employer, too.3
1.26
The first thing to notice is just how important the employer/employee
relationship can be for the employee. Obviously this varies: the 25-year-old
graduate in his third job in the last four years will feel much less attachment
to his employment than the fifty-something who has been with the same
employer since leaving school at 16. But in many cases, losing your job
doesn’t just mean losing an income: it can mean losing much of your reason
for getting up in the morning, daily contact with people with whom you
have a shared history and circle of acquaintance, your status, your selfesteem and much of your social life as well.
1.27
The importance of the employment relationship is not symmetrical. Most
employees have a considerable emotional investment in their jobs.
Employers don’t as a rule have any particular emotional attachment to their
employees. Although the bodies that employ staff act through human
beings, and those individual human beings can be kind and well-meaning,
the body itself does not – whatever its mission statement or staff handbook
may say to the contrary – ‘care’. It simply lacks the equipment with which
caring is done.
1.28
Both factors make litigation tempting. Being an employee can have
something in common with being the child of a psychopathic parent: you
have a large emotional investment in a relationship with something that
does not care about you at all. Litigation can seem like the only way to
shout loudly enough to force the psychopath to pay attention. A significant
proportion of tribunal cases are motivated as much by personal feelings of
rejection and betrayal as by a realistic or well-judged expectation of
winning sufficient compensation to justify the cost of the claim.

1.29
This is not a good basis on which to litigate. Because the employment
relationship is so important to an employee, its termination often causes
significant distress, and not infrequently depression. One of the
consequences, ultimately, of an employment tribunal claim may be that the
employer has to pay the former employee some money. Occasionally this
will be a large sum of money, but more often it will be modest.
1.30
Very rarely, the employer is ordered to reinstate or re-engage the
employee; even more rarely is such an order obeyed. In 2012/13, out of a
total of 4,596 unfair dismissal complaints upheld by the tribunals, 5 resulted
in an order for reinstatement or re-engagement. The statistics don’t show
how many of those orders actually resulted in the employee returning to
work, but our best guess is precisely none. ‘To get my job back’ is a bad
reason to bring a claim: you almost certainly won’t. (That doesn’t mean it’s
a bad idea to try for reinstatement or re-engagement. If you intend to bring a
claim anyway, it can be a very good idea: see further at para 6.37.)
1.31
The price that you will pay for these uncertain benefits is a long period in
which you must dwell on the events surrounding the termination; study all
the correspondence and associated documentation in detail; give a statement
to an adviser or solicitor (or write it yourself); draft or approve the claim to
the tribunal; read and comment on your employer’s response; correspond
with the employer or its solicitor; and ultimately, unless the claim settles,
undergo hostile cross-examination and listen to your employer justify its
conduct during the hearing. The effect is that you must keep some kind of
relationship going with your former employer, and you must allow the
events surrounding or preceding the termination of employment to
dominate your thoughts – and very likely your dreams too – over a period
of months or years.
1.32
For all these reasons, if your employment has ended in stress and
depression, litigating about it will almost certainly make it worse.
Claimants often say something to the effect of: ‘If I had known what this
was going to be like, I would never have begun.’ But here another
mechanism comes into play. Litigation is a form of gambling, and gambling

is notoriously addictive. Losses are part of the reason: you may wish you
had never begun, but the heavier your losses to date, the more painful and
difficult it is to admit that they have been suffered for nothing. From this
point it is an easy path to obsession. Litigation can seriously damage your
mental health. Social lives and marriages can suffer or crumble under the
strain. One point to keep clearly in mind is that on the whole, the angrier
you feel about the way your employer has treated you, the higher will be the
emotional costs and risks of fighting the case.
1.33
It is sensible to litigate (a) if you have to; or (b) where you have a point
you want to make, but the outcome is not of enormous personal importance
to you, and the financial costs are borne by someone else; or (c) if there is a
fairly clear probability that the costs – emotional as well as financial – will
be justified by the benefits. The first two rarely arise in employment
litigation.
1.34
In an earlier edition of this book we said that the conclusion to all of this
is that litigation – even in the relatively informal and low-risk environment
of the employment tribunals – is almost always a bad idea once you have
taken into account the factors that lawyers do not concern themselves with
as well as those that they do.4 We still think this is broadly true, but in the
current economic climate there is a greater likelihood of being effectively
forced into litigation by financial need.
1.35
A middle way can be to make the decision to commence proceedings
purely in order to achieve a settlement, while resolving that it will be
withdrawn if not settled during the early stages.5 This is like gambling with
a set budget. It may require considerable firmness of purpose to stick to
your original intention about how much effort and money you will commit
before cutting your losses, but if you can do that it is worth considering.

Read this third: mitigation
1.36
If you do decide to bring a claim, you’re almost certainly going to be
looking for compensation at the end of the case. That will feel a long way

off at this point – and it may well be a long way off, because claims can
easily take a year or more to get heard by an employment tribunal. But the
quality of your evidence of mitigation can make a big difference to how
much compensation you are awarded.
1.37
There’s guidance on this subject at paras 10.37–10.42, in the chapter
about compensation towards the end of this book. But if you’re are going to
bring a claim you need to read it now, because the duty to mitigate arises as
soon as you lose your job. If you don’t think about it until a few weeks
before the hearing of your claim, it will be too late to start mitigating your
loss – and much harder to assemble your evidence of mitigation than if you
have been collecting it systematically all the while.

Sources of employment law advice and
representation
1.38
This book is partly aimed at individuals representing themselves in
employment tribunal claims. The employment tribunal process is intended
to be accessible to people without specialist knowledge, and many
individuals do represent themselves. Nevertheless, most people will prefer
to have representation if they can find it.
1.39
If you can’t afford to pay substantial sums of money for representation
you should consider the possibilities of free or affordable representation in
this order:
your trade union;
your household, credit card, car (etc) insurance;
a voluntary sector advice centre;
high street solicitors/barristers offering public access;
employment consultants.

Trade unions
1.40

If you are a member of a trade union, you should normally expect to be
represented by the union in a dispute with his employer. Unions have
different rules about which cases they will support. Often it will depend on
whether they think the claim is likely to succeed. Some will withdraw
support (even shortly before the hearing) if you refuse to accept what the
union’s lawyers think is a good offer of settlement. If you are relying on
union assistance you should make sure that you understand the
circumstances in which it will be withdrawn.

Insurance
1.41
Household (and other) insurance policies include legal expenses insurance
surprisingly often. This tends to be a neglected source of assistance for the
simple reason that many people don’t realise that they have the cover.
1.42
It can be extraordinarily good value: the insurance may cover all legal
expenses, including specialist representation at the hearing, with no clawback even if you recover a large award. It is important to investigate this at
an early stage in the dispute, however, because if you take steps in
employment tribunal proceedings without the advice of an insurer-approved
lawyer, you may you find that you have invalidated your insurance.6

Voluntary sector advice agencies
1.43
There are various kinds of voluntary sector advice agencies that may be
able to offer free advice and/or representation. Almost all of them are badly
over-stretched, and many claimants will spend fruitless hours telephoning
advice agencies only to be told that no one can help. However, some
agencies will deliver an exceptional service that rivals the best that private
practice solicitors can offer, so (within limits) it is worth persevering. The
process may well be frustrating, but if you’re seeking free representation,
try not to let the frustration show. Mostly ‘we can’t help’ means just that –
the organisation simply has no spare capacity, or does not do this sort of
work. If there’s any flexibility, human nature is as it is and charm almost
always gets further than aggression.7

1.44
Most voluntary sector advice agencies belong to an umbrella
organisation, and that organisation’s website will often be the best starting
point for finding local services. The main umbrella organisations and their
website addresses are:
Law Centres: Law Centres Network: www.lawcentres.org.uk;
Citizens
Advice
Bureaux
(CABx):
Citizens
Advice:
www.citizensadvice.org.uk;
Other advice agencies: AdviceUK: www.adviceuk.org.uk.

Law Centres
1.45
Law Centres are, in effect, not-for-profit solicitors’ practices that specialise
in what is broadly defined as ‘social welfare law’ – typically housing,
immigration, employment and welfare rights. Most if not all law centres
operate a catchment area policy and will only advise those who live (or
sometimes work or worked) in their area. Many will only accept clients
who are financially eligible for public funding, and the rest are likely to
impose some kind of means test on access to their services. Some still
employ an employment lawyer or specialist adviser, but these services are
under severe pressure because of legal aid cuts. The Law Centres Network
website currently lists 51 law centres in the UK, roughly half of which are
in Greater London. Most of the rest are in substantial town or city centres.

Citizens Advice Bureaux
1.46
CABx tend to offer a generalist service, and only a few employ a specialist
employment adviser. CABx do not generally have a catchment area policy
and will advise anyone who approaches, subject to availability of advisers.
They do not generally means-test their clients except for publicly funded
work. There are around 426 CABx in England and Wales: any sizeable
town centre is likely to have one. The umbrella group is called Citizens
Advice.

The Free Representation Unit and the Bar Pro Bono Unit
1.47
In London, the Free Representation Unit (FRU) can sometimes provide
representation at employment tribunals, but it does not deal direct with
members of the public. Cases must be referred, after a hearing date has been
fixed, by a solicitor, law centre, CAB or other advice agency.8 Claimants in
London who are receiving advice and assistance for case preparation, but
whose adviser is not able to represent them at a hearing should make sure
their cases are referred to FRU as soon as a hearing date is set to have the
best chance of representation. Most FRU volunteers are student or trainee
lawyers who work under the supervision of a specialist employment lawyer.
They choose their own cases, rather than having cases assigned to them, so
FRU can never guarantee representation in any given case until a particular
volunteer has offered to take it on.
1.48
The Bar Pro Bono Unit (BPBU) is a charity funded by the Bar Council
and others that matches clients in need of free representation with barristers
willing to give their time. Because the kind of work barristers are permitted
to do is restricted, BPBU is best able to assist clients who are represented
by a solicitor’s firm or advice agency that is willing to retain conduct of the
case and instruct the barrister to do defined pieces of work – to draft a
document, for example, or appear at the hearing. Like FRU, BPBU will
only accept referrals from an advice agency. It will not deal direct with
members of the public. Unlike FRU, BPBU puts applications for assistance
through a careful sift to decide whether or not to offer help, so an
application to BPBU should always be made as early as possible. BPBU
itself is located in London, but its services are potentially available
throughout England and Wales. As with FRU, the fact that BPBU has
accepted a referral is no guarantee that it will be able to assist. The Unit’s
website is www.barprobonounit.org.uk.

LawWorks
1.49
LawWorks is a solicitors’ pro bono organisation.9 Like BPBU and FRU, it
accepts applications for assistance only through advice agencies. Like

BPBU, it applies both means and merits tests before offering assistance. An
application form can be downloaded from its website.

Specialist charities
1.50
Some of the larger disability charities, including RNIB (Royal National
Institute for the Blind) and the Disability Law Service, employ specialist
advisers who can advise and sometimes represent in disability
discrimination cases. Public Concern at Work provides a helpline on
whistle-blowing issues but does not undertake casework. The Terrence
Higgins Trust provides helpline advice on HIV-status employment issues,
and may be able to refer on to other agencies for casework.10
1.51
This is not a comprehensive list, and policies and personnel can change
rapidly, so it is always worth investigating carefully whether there is a
specialist charity that may be able to help.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission
1.52
The EHRC is the statutory body responsible for all aspects of equality law.
That means that they cover discrimination on the ground of sex; race;
disability; sexual orientation; religion and belief; pregnancy and maternity;
mariage and civil partnership, gender reassignment and age. They also deal
with human rights, but this is of limited relevance in the employment
context.
1.53
The EHRC website provides guidance on equality rights and tribunal
claims.11
1.54
In very rare cases they are able to provide representation for a case where
the result would affect a large number of other individuals.

Private practice solicitors
1.55

If you are eligible for public funding (ie your case is about discrimination,
and you are dependent on means-tested benefits or on a very low income),
you may be able to find a solicitor who can advise and assist with
preparation of the case. There is no public funding for representation at the
tribunal hearing in any but the most exceptional cases, so claimants who
take advantage of this scheme are likely to find that they either have to
represent themselves at tribunal or pay privately for a solicitor or a barrister
to represent them. If your case isn’t about discrimination, the 2013 legal aid
reforms mean that you won’t get any publicly funded advice or
representation, however little money you have.
1.56
The decision to pay privately for employment law advice should be
approached with great caution. Lawyers’ fees mount up frighteningly fast,
and the total value of an employment tribunal claim is often too small to
justify them. Some solicitors offer ‘no win no fee’ agreements, but the
drawback to these is that, because the solicitor is taking a risk of not being
paid at all, the fee if the case is successful will normally be higher than it
would otherwise have been. There can also be sums that you have to pay
anyway, such as fees for medical or other experts’ reports or barristers’ fees.
Occasionally this will be the best, or the only practical, way of running an
employment tribunal claim, but if you are considering taking this course
you should make sure you have had a very clear explanation of the ‘worst
case’ outcome before making a decision. It is also worth asking solicitors to
advise, as a preliminary matter, on whether any insurance policy you have
is capable of covering legal expenses.

Barristers offering ‘public access’
1.57
Traditionally, barristers are specialist advocates who act when instructed by
solicitors; so you would instruct a solicitor first, and then, if you wanted to
and/or your solicitor advised that you should, you would instruct a barrister
as well – probably mainly for the hearing.
1.58
Some barristers do now accept instructions direct from the public for
certain kinds of work, so you can also choose to instruct a barrister only.

This can be quite an economical way of running your case, because
barristers have lower overheads than solicitors, and that means they tend to
charge lower hourly rates for their work. And they will still probably charge
a brief fee for the hearing, so at the point where the case really starts to eat
time, you do at least know in advance exactly what it’s going to cost you.
1.59
But barristers are self-employed individuals, working without the
structure of a solicitors’ firm. They will be juggling the demands of your
case with other court work, and they won’t as a rule be able to leave a
colleague looking after your case while they are unavailable. So if you
instruct a barrister, you need to be confident that you can do the
administrative parts of a solicitor’s job yourself: you will probably need to
handle all the correspondence, keep track of deadlines and so on.

Employment consultants
1.60
A number of firms of employment consultants offer their services in this
area and some of these market aggressively. Proceed with caution if you’re
thinking of using one of these organisations. Check first that they are
authorised as a ‘regulated claims management service’. Anyone providing
representation in employment tribunals, for profit, who is not a qualified
lawyer, must be authorised by the Ministry of Justice.12 If an organisation is
not registered, don’t use it. Unfortunately, being properly authorised is no
guarantee of quality. These organisations vary widely: although some can
provide a good and relatively cheap service, others are worse than useless.

ACAS Helpline
1.61
ACAS run a national helpline that gives employment advice to both
employees and employers. The number is 08457 47 47 47.
1.62
Telephone advice is inevitably limited. It is not possible to provide
detailed advice during a short conversation and without seeing the relevant
papers. Nonetheless, the helpline can be a good source of basic advice.

Making the most of your adviser
1.63
Most of this book is written for people who are either representing a client
in the employment tribunal, or are representing themselves. The underlying
assumption is that if you are a claimant in an employment tribunal case who
has an adviser, you can leave running the case to her.
1.64
That assumption is not completely accurate. If you’re getting free advice,
the time your adviser can spend on your case will be limited by the other
demands on her time – and demand for free legal advice vastly outstrips
supply, so the chances are she’s rushed off her feet. If she’s representing
you by way of Legal Help, she will be operating under grossly unrealistic
time limits imposed by the Legal Aid Agency. And if you’re paying for
legal advice, the time your lawyer can spend on your case will be limited by
your budget: lawyers normally charge by the hour.13 Whatever the situation,
there will almost certainly be a limit, and probably quite a tight one.
1.65
Case preparation consumes time at a frightening rate, so if you do
everything in your power to limit the time your adviser has to spend on
non-essential tasks, or tasks she’s no better qualified than you to do, you
will maximise the time she has available for more difficult things.
1.66
One of the simplest things you can do is provide your adviser with a
well-organised set of papers. Taking letters out of envelopes, removing
staples and paperclips, sorting papers into chronological order, weeding out
duplicates, photocopying and hole-punching are all easy tasks – but timeconsuming. You would think it mad to pay anyone £100 or more an hour to
sort your laundry, but it is surprising how many people are prepared to pay
their lawyers to put papers into chronological order.
1.67
Be as focused as possible in the information you give to your adviser, and
the way you answer her questions. In ordinary conversation, a question is
very often not so much a request for specific information as a polite cue
whose purpose is to make space for you to talk for a bit. If it was your habit
to behave in social situations like the ideal client or witness – just giving a

succinct factual answer focused precisely on the question you were asked,
and then stopping to wait for the next question – you’d soon stop getting
invitations. But a legal adviser’s questions are best treated in precisely that
way.
1.68
There are many sources of free information for people going through
employment tribunal claims, so try to get the answers to your basic
questions that way before paying your lawyer to tell you. We hope that this
book will answer a lot of questions. Employment law: an adviser’s
handbook14 will probably answer most of your questions about the
substantive law. Even if you can’t find a complete answer, a little research
is likely to refine your question and put you in a better position to
understand the answer.
1.69
If you’re trying to keep your legal costs down, you can always ask ‘Is
that something I could do myself?’ or ‘Will it save time if I do a first draft?’
when your lawyer tells you that a particular piece of work needs doing.
You’ll certainly save quite a lot of your adviser’s time if you write a good
first draft of your witness statement.15
1.70
It’s quite likely that at some stage in your case your adviser will tell you
something you don’t want to hear. This may be that part, or even all, of you
case is likely to lose. Or it may be that she doesn’t think it’s a good idea to
run a particular argument, or call a particular witness. Lawyers aren’t
always right, and it certainly can be worth making them defend their
judgments about your case. But it’s also worth remembering that you went
to them in the first place because you felt you needed specialist help.
Ultimately, if you try to dictate to them exactly how to run the case, they are
likely to point out that if you don’t trust their judgment, you are free to sack
them and do the job yourself.
1.71
Finally, bear in mind that lawyers are people. Your lawyer has a
professional obligation to act in your best interests even if you are rude and
aggressive, but having her whole-heartedly on your side is better. Some
consideration can go a long way. Your adviser is working on many other

cases at the same time as yours, and there will be times when she has to
give other work top priority, or is just unavailable because she’s on holiday.

Representing yourself
1.72
If you’re unable to obtain representation from someone else, you will have
to represent yourself. There’s nothing unusual about this. The tribunal is
used to it and will, to an extent, try to help you. Tens of thousands of
claimants represent themselves in tribunals every year, and many of them
win their cases.
1.73
That said, competent representation helps; and the better the
representation, the more it will help. The reasons are simple, if unfair. The
better the representative, the better the case will be presented. The right
points will be taken, arguments will be presented persuasively and, perhaps
most importantly, witnesses will be cross-examined effectively. In general,
an experienced lawyer will do all of this better than a claimant acting for
himself. If you’re a claimant acting for yourself against an experienced
lawyer representing your former employer, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.
1.74
But there are a few things to bear in mind. Crucially, although good
representation is helpful, other factors are more important. The biggest
factor in deciding the outcome of the case is what actually happened. If on
learning that you were pregnant, your employer sacked you on the spot and
then sent you a letter complaining of your disloyalty in putting family
before your job, you’ll win your unfair dismissal and sex discrimination
claim however good your employer’s representation. If you’re an airline
pilot who turned up for work drunk, and you were dismissed after a
textbook disciplinary process, you’ll lose even if you’re represented by the
best lawyer on the planet.
1.75
What good advocates can do is influence the odds. If the chances of
winning are about 50/50, good representation might make it 60/40. When
dealing with remedy, representation might make the difference between an
award of £34,000 and £37,000. These differences matter, but not so much

that you should feel defeated from the outset just because you’re
representing yourself.
1.76
Remember, too, that quite a lot of what the other side’s lawyer will be
doing with her ability and experience isn’t about your case at all. Lawyers
don’t deal with one case at a time. They deal with dozens, or a hundred.16 A
great deal of their work is mastering the facts of all these cases from a
standing start. If you’re acting for yourself you don’t have to do that: you
know the facts of your case, because you’ve lived them. The tribunal will
normally be more tolerant of your mistakes than they would be of a
lawyer’s. They will expect to do more work themselves. They will want you
to explain why you think your dismissal was unfair or how you were
discriminated against. But they should be willing to translate what you say
into legal concepts. Similarly, they will expect to have to engage more
closely with the evidence, including questioning witnesses, than they would
if both parties were represented.
1.77
Finally, anyone facing a lawyer with a fearsome reputation should
consider this. Lawyers with fearsome reputations generally charge fearsome
fees. This has two potentially helpful implications. First, your employer
must be seriously worried to be spending this much defending your case.
That probably means they think it is strong. Secondly, it pushes up the
settlement value of the claim. If your claim is listed for a 10-day hearing
and your employer has instructed a barrister who doesn’t get out of bed for
less than £2,000 a day, that’s £20,000 they will save if case settles even
before you take solicitors’ fees into account.

Outline of the employment tribunal process
1.78
In very broad outline, the process falls into five stages: (1) the early
conciliation period; (2) the employee’s formal claim and the employer’s
response, presented on forms ET1 and ET3 respectively; (3) requests by
each side for information and documents, and requests to the tribunal for
orders if these requests are not voluntarily complied with; (4) preparation
by each side of all the documents that will be required for the hearing: the

witness statements, an agreed bundle of all relevant documentary evidence,
any written representations, chronologies, lists of issues, etc; and (5) the
hearing itself.
1.79
There may be negotiations at any of these stages. The parties are
normally referred to as the claimant (the employee who brings the claim)
and the respondent (the employer, who responds to it). The best time for
them is early on, before either side has committed a great deal of time and
energy (and probably money) to the case. Often, though, neither side really
focuses on negotiations until the hearing is close.

Sources of employment law
1.80
There are broadly two sources of law in the employment tribunals. One is
legislation: the law passed by parliament. The other is case-law, some of
which consists of the courts’ interpretations and explanations of legislation,
and some of which is what is called ‘common law’ – law that doesn’t come
from legislation at all, but has been developed over the years by the courts.
(There’s also European law, but for the most part that takes effect by way of
UK legislation.)
1.81
Legislation and case-law change all the time. Employment law is one of
the most political areas of the law; successive governments can’t stop
fiddling with it. Most of the major employment statutes have been regularly
updated since they came into force.
1.82
Case-law too is in a constant state of development as the courts reach
new decisions. Normally this is a relatively gentle process of refining what
has gone before, but there are occasional sudden shifts. This means you
need to take some care needs to ensure that you’re referring to the current
law.17
1.83
Most tribunal cases are brought under a cause of action (see glossary for
an explanation of this term) created by a statute. For example, claims for
discrimination on grounds of sex are brought under the Equality Act 2010.

The reason these claims are possible is that the Equality Act says such
discrimination is unlawful and gives the employment tribunals jurisdiction
to deal with the cases. What is unlawful and what the tribunal can do about
it is set down in the Act.
1.84
At the heart of the employment relationship is the contract of
employment. Contract law is what’s called a common law subject: that is,
its main principles are to be found in previously decided cases rather than in
statutes.18
1.85
Employment tribunals must apply common law principles where
appropriate as well as the relevant statutory rules. Contract law is one
example of this, but there are many others.
1.86
To complicate matters further, there’s a substantial body of European
employment law; and the European Convention on Human Rights, applied
in the UK by way of the Human Rights Act 1998, also has many
applications in this area.
1.87
Whether the tribunal is considering a statutory or a common law rule,
cases that have been decided in the past by the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (EAT) or higher courts set precedents that must be followed by the
employment tribunals. Courts and tribunals are generally bound to follow
the decisions of higher courts: so, for example, the employment tribunals
must decide cases in a way consistent with the previous decisions of the
EAT, the EAT must follow the rulings of the Court of Appeal, and the Court
of Appeal must follow its own previous rulings and the rulings of the
Supreme Court (previously the House of Lords).19
1.88
Sometimes the argument between the parties will focus on whether or not
the facts of the case are similar in the relevant way to the facts of a
previously decided case, so that the result in the earlier case is binding on
the tribunal that decides the later case. The party seeking to apply the result
in a previous case will say that the two cases are alike in all relevant
respects; the other party will argue that there is a material difference
between the cases that means that the earlier case need not be followed.20

1.89
The only way to gain a proper understanding of this process of reasoning
is to read reports of cases. Employment cases are reported in two monthly
series, the Industrial Case Reports (ICR) and the Industrial Relations Law
Reports (IRLR), both of which should be available in any law library.21
1.90
The standard method of referring to a case reported in one of these, or
similar, series follows the pattern: Party v Other Party [2014] IRLR 382.
This tells you that the report of the case will be found at page 382 of the
2014 volume of the Industrial Relations Law Reports. In addition, more
recent decisions of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the Court of Appeal
and the Supreme Court are all available online.22

Books
1.91
A great many books are published on employment law, and the following
represent a tiny sample of what is available. Employment Law: an adviser’s
handbook by Tamara Lewis is published by Legal Action Group (10th
edition, 2013). This is an excellent and accessible short guide to the
substantive law. The same author has also written The Claimant’s
Companion: a client’s guide to employment tribunal cases, which can be
downloaded as a pdf from the www.londonlawcentre.org.uk.
1.92
Two series that you certainly won’t want to buy – because they are
extremely expensive – but you may want to consult in a library if a difficult
question arises in your case to which you can’t find the answer in one of the
shorter books are Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law
(Butterworths) and the IDS Handbooks. ‘Harvey’ is a large loose-leaf
publication in several volumes that explains the law in great detail and is
updated regularly throughout the year.23 The IDS Handbooks are a series of
short or shortish guides on specific employment topics: unfair dismissal,
equal pay, tribunal practice and procedure, continuity of employment, and
so on.
1.93

Law books in general are difficult to read if you’re not used to them, but
don’t let them faze you. If you don’t understand something the first time
you read it, take another run at it. If you still don’t understand it, try looking
up the same topic in a different book. Read the cases referred to, especially
Court of Appeal cases: (some) judges are some of the best legal writers
around, and sometimes they will explain things more clearly than the
textbooks.

Key employment cases
1.94
There are certain decided cases that determine points of such fundamental
importance to employment law that all those advising in the area need to be
aware of them, and preferably to have read them. No two employment
lawyers would compile the same list, and the decision whether to list 10, 50
or 100 cases is arbitrary. With those reservations, the following is offered as
a selection of some of the fundamental cases – divided into broad subject
areas – that advisers should be familiar with.

The tribunal’s powers
1.95
The tribunals operate under the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and
Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013,24 and in particular under Schedule 1
to the Regulations, the Employments Tribunal Rules of Procedure. These
are referred to throughout this book simply as the ‘procedure rules’.
1.96
It’s worthwhile to read through the regulations and the procedure rules at
an early stage in proceedings so as to be broadly familiar with the scope of
the tribunal’s powers.25
1.97
Particular provisions to note are the interpretation provisions at
regulation 3 and Schedule 1 rule 1; the overriding objective at rule 3 and the
guidance on calculation of time limits at rule 4. Rules 1–106 are the main
rules that govern most types of proceedings, and rules 29–40 (case
management), and 75–84 (costs and preparation time orders) are of
particular practical significance.
1.98
In the 2013 rules, the case management powers have been ‘simplified’ in
a particularly unhelpful way. The old (2004) rules gave a long list of
examples of the kinds of orders that might be made. There’s a different and
much shorter selection of specific powers in the 2013 rules; but the general
words of rule 29 make it clear enough to anyone familiar with the old rules
that the tribunal can and probably will continue to exercise all the powers
specifically set out there.
1.99
That being the case, it’s worth knowing what the old rules covered. They
specifically empowered the tribunal to make orders:
about how the proceedings were to be conducted;

about the time by which things were to be done;
that a party provide additional information;
requiring the attendance of witnesses;
for the disclosure of documents or information;
extending time limits;
requiring the provision of written answers to questions;
staying the whole or part of proceedings;
that different claims be considered together;
that part of the case be considered separately;
that different claims be heard together;
adding or removing respondents;
postponing or adjourning any hearing;
giving permission to amend a claim or response;
about the use of witness statements;
about the use of expert witnesses.
1.100
Employment judges being (like everyone else) creatures of habit, they will
feel more comfortable making these familiar sorts of orders than making
entirely novel orders dreamed up to deal with the circumstances of a
particular case; and anyway, the orders listed are the kinds of orders that are
most commonly needed in practice. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ever
ask for an order not on this list; it just means that if you do, you’ll be asking
for something a bit unfamiliar – so the tribunal may be harder to persuade.
1.101
The President of the employment tribunals has power to issue practice
directions giving detailed guidance about how cases should be conducted.
Under the old rules, practice directions were exclusively concerned with the
practicalities of handling large-scale multiple claims: for example, mass
equal pay litigation. At the time of writing, the only practice direction that
has been issued under the 2013 rules is on the presentation of claims. It can
be downloaded as a pdf from the Ministry of Justice website.26
1.102
The procedure rules will not be the only material informing the tribunal’s
procedural decisions. Tribunals are very often guided – sometimes, but not
always, consciously – by principles and procedures that operate in the

ordinary courts, often drawn from the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) which
apply there. If the tribunal criticises you for some failure to observe
‘obvious common sense’ or ‘basic good practice’ in some aspect of the
conduct of proceedings on which neither your own common sense nor the
procedure rules provide any guidance, the chances are that this is what is
going on. The chairman has absorbed principles from the CPR or rules of
conduct or etiquette in the ordinary courts, and is treating them as selfevident.
1.103
For this reason, some familiarity with the CPR is useful if you’re an
employment adviser – partly so that you’re not taken by surprise when the
tribunal borrows from the CPR, and partly so that you’re in a position either
to warn the tribunal against automatic adherence to rules devised for a more
formal setting, or sometimes to propose that the manner of dealing with
particular practical problems set out in the CPR should be adopted. The
CPR can also provide insights into the thinking behind the tribunal
procedure rules. In many instances, the latter are a simplified version of the
former; sometimes, on the other hand, it is clear that a deliberate distinction
has been made between the tribunal rules and the CPR.27
1.104
The up-to-date CPR can be found on the Ministry of Justice website.28
This should be regarded as a recommendation only for advisers who will
run a substantial number of cases for clients, however: grappling with the
fairly forbidding CPR is unlikely to be the best use of your time if you’re
representing yourself.

General note on correspondence
1.105
Much of your correspondence with the tribunal or the other side will have a
secondary tactical motive as well as the purpose it has on its face.
Remember that any correspondence may in some circumstances be read by
the tribunal, so always maintain a calm and co-operative style. This rule
won’t necessarily be followed the respondent or its advisers, but try to resist
the temptation to be abrasive or sarcastic even if sorely provoked. This can
be particularly important if either side makes a costs application at the end

of the case. If there is unavoidable delay, or there has been a
misunderstanding, an apology costs nothing and can help avoid unnecessary
conflict with the other party. A well-placed and graceful apology may even
help tip the tribunal away from making a costs award if otherwise there are
grounds for one.
1.106
There are good reasons in any event to keep relations with the respondent
as calm as possible. Many aspects of the preparation of the case will go
more smoothly if there’s co-operation between the parties. Litigation is very
like a formal game with a serious outcome. To win any game, it is necessary
to co-operate sufficiently with the other player to complete it. Angry
squabbling about when exactly witness statements should be exchanged,
who prepares the bundle for the hearing, whether the hearing is likely to last
for three days or four etc is as futile and as little likely to affect the outcome
as a dispute between two chess players about whether the 12-inch or the 18inch chessboard should be used. Both sides are likely to encounter certain
difficulties along the way, and will sometimes need the other side’s
indulgence when they are unable to meet deadlines, etc. If the tone of the
proceedings has been quarrelsome from the start, each side may waste a
great deal of time (and often money too) scoring every possible point off
the other. It’s far better to be flexible about things that don’t matter, and
save your energy for the few battles that will win or lose the case. If you’re
acting in person against a represented employer, it’s worth making a real
effort to remember that the lawyer on the other side is simply doing the job
she’s paid to do in representing the respondent’s interests, and is not a
personal enemy.
1.107
Letters should make their point plainly and in as few words as possible.
Normally if you write to the other side or the tribunal, it is because you
want them to do something: you want them to tell you something, or send
you a document, or order the other side to do something, or postpone the
case, etc. Say what it is you want them to do, and why, as simply and
clearly as you can, and then stop writing.
1.108
If you get a long quarrelsome letter from the other side, try not to get
drawn in. Pick up a highlighter and highlight the bits of the letter that ask

you to do something. Decide whether or not you’re prepared to do it. Even
if the letter is quarrelsome, approach that question with the attitude ‘Is there
any reason why not?’ rather than ‘Why should I?’ Write a short letter back
telling them what you have decided – or doing what you’re asked. If you’re
refusing to do what they ask of you, explain briefly why. Ignore the rest of
their letter.
1.109
Avoid fancy type-faces. Use headings and numbers to add clarity, but
don’t use underlining, bold, capitals or italics for emphasis. If you really
must emphasise something, use italics; capitals are the written equivalent of
shouting, and writing a letter or e-mail in capitals is likely to be experienced
by the reader as deliberate rudeness. Type your letters if you possibly can.
1.110
Inexperienced advisers sometimes feel that they ought to act the part and
write legalese. Opening and closing gambits like ‘I write further to our
conversation [/my letter] of [date]’ or ‘I write in relation to the abovementioned matter and refer to your letter of [date]’ or ‘I look forward to
hearing from you at your earliest convenience and thank you for your
attention’ are redundant. The heading indicates the subject-matter of the
letter, and ‘thank you for your letter of [date]’ is ample to provide the link
to the letter being answered. If there’s a particular need for an urgent
answer, it makes sense to spell that out, but otherwise there’s rarely a need
to add a specific request for a reply.
1.111
Letters can be sent in the conventional manner, either first or second
class. There’s no requirement for recorded or special delivery. In fact,
sending letters recorded delivery can be an effective way of delaying them:
the demand for a signature on delivery means that if the recipient isn’t at
home or doesn’t hear the doorbell, the letter is taken back to the sorting
office for collection later – or possibly never. E-mail correspondence is
common and perfectly acceptable; fax machines are getting rarer, but if
both sides have them that’s fine too.
1.112
Some solicitors still routinely duplicate faxed or e-mailed
correspondence by post. Don’t do this – it’s unnecessary, and can cause the
tribunal and the other side extra work. If the other party finds it at all

difficult to deal with correspondence (by reason of a visual impairment, for
example, or dyslexia) it’s particularly unhelpful. The tribunals positively
ask parties not to do it. If it’s essential to ensure that a document arrives by
a certain date, the sensible thing is to fax or e-mail it and then follow the fax
with a telephone call to confirm arrival. An attendance note of that
conversation, identifying the person spoken to, should be ample proof of
delivery if you need it.
1.113
If an e-mail doesn’t seem to give the right degree of formality, you can
attach a letter as a separate document. The main danger of using e-mail for
this purpose is that the speed of e-mail exchanges can escalate a difference
of views into a quarrel very quickly, and e-mails leave a permanent record
that may later be shown to the tribunal. So draft e-mails with the same care
as any other correspondence, and keep them calm and reasonable.
1.114
Get into the habit of removing information about previous drafts, etc
from any e-mailed attachment. This can be most simply done by selecting
and copying the text and pasting it into a new document before attaching to
an e-mail. Sending a witness statement to the respondent with recoverable
information about previous drafts could be very damaging.
1.115
All letters to the tribunal should be copied to the respondent. Many
advisers routinely copy all correspondence with the other side, other than
‘without prejudice’ correspondence, to the tribunal, but this is
unnecessary.29 It’s better to copy correspondence to the tribunal only if it is
relevant to something you’re asking the tribunal to do. So, for example,
don’t copy a request for additional information to the tribunal when you
first make it; but if the respondent refuses to comply, send it to the tribunal
with your application for an order. If there’s been an extended wrangle over
some aspect of case preparation, the tribunal will only need to see the
relevant correspondence if and when it is asked to adjudicate on it, or if one
party seeks costs on grounds of the other party’s unreasonable conduct. At
that point you can copy the whole correspondence to the tribunal, or collate
it into a bundle to support the point you want to make at a hearing.
1.116

Always think about the convenience of both the other party and the
tribunal. A history of conspicuously considerate letters will be one of your
best defences if the other side applies for their costs at any stage. So, for
example, if you’re unable to meet a deadline, let the respondent know about
the difficulty as soon as you become aware of it, and propose a realistic
revised timetable. Or if you want to amend your claim, the respondent will
probably need to amend their response to deal with the new points. The
letter requesting permission to amend should recognise this and propose
suitable arrangements.
1.117
These are just examples. The point is to make co-operativeness your
default position; only get into a tussle with the other side if it’s genuinely
worthwhile in terms of the likelihood of winning your case.
1.118
It’s conventional to address letters sent to the tribunal to ‘the Regional
Secretary’, with a request, where appropriate, to refer the letter or the
application to a judge for his or her attention. The regional secretaries are
the administrative heads of the employment tribunals; the regional chairmen
are the judicial heads. Similarly, correspondence with the EAT is addressed
to the Registrar, who is the administrative head of the EAT. At the time of
writing the Registrar at the EAT and many, possibly the majority, of the
regional secretaries are women. The examples in this book use the
salutation ‘Dear Madam’ throughout.
1.119
Letters are drafted in the first person in this book: even if you’re an
adviser employed by an organisation, you’re still an individual, and the
decisions you make about the case are your decisions. It’s probably better to
take individual responsibility for them; if that makes you feel
uncomfortable, it may be a clue that you’re not making the right decisions.
1.120
The opening ‘Dear Sirs’ is still in common use, but if you think about it,
as a form of address for an organisation in which women work, it’s pretty
discourteous. The examples in this book are addressed either to the
individual with conduct of the case (‘Dear Mr Bean’, ‘Dear Sir’, ‘Dear Ms
Marrow’, ‘Dear Madam’) or else to the organisation by name (‘Dear Carrot
& Marrow’, ‘Dear NaffTat plc’, ‘Dear Camden Council’).

1.121
Documents other than letters are given formal headings showing the
parties’ names, the tribunal, the case number and the title of the document
laid out in a conventional pattern.30 These headings are not compulsory and
are far from universal in employment tribunal litigation; it is largely a
matter of personal taste whether or not to use them.

Telephone calls
1.122
The choice between writing a letter and making a telephone call to the
tribunal or the respondent will often be obvious. A formal request for
disclosure of documents or an application for permission to amend the
claim or postpone the hearing must be made in writing. If the respondent
has faxed a letter, part of which is illegible, the only sensible thing is to pick
up the telephone to them straight away and ask them to re-send it.
1.123
Between these extremes there will be many communications for which
either will do fine. To a large extent the choice will be a matter of
preference, though if you’re not used to conducting litigation you may
make your task harder than necessary by dealing with almost everything by
letter. So keep letters to a reasonable minimum and use the telephone
instead where possible. This will save time and energy, and will also tend to
encourage the other side to co-operate with you.
1.124
It’s also worth remembering that both tribunal staff and lawyers acting
for the respondent can be a valuable source of background information
about how things are usually done or what the tribunal’s expectations will
be. It’s much easier to tap into that kind of information in a fairly informal
telephone conversation than in an exchange of letters.31

File and diary management
1.125
Running an employment tribunal case requires habits that are second nature
to solicitors, and to anyone else whose normal work requires them to handle

correspondence files over months or years. But if you don’t do that kind of
work, you’ll need to learn those habits especially for your case.
1.126
The first point is that the papers relating to the case should be kept
together in a ring-binder, lever-arch file or cardboard wallet file. Which you
use will probably depend on the volume of papers. File a copy of anything
you send out or receive. If you make handwritten notes – for example, of a
phone call while you’re on the phone – you should file them too, even if
you also make a typed copy.
1.127
Make a brief note of any telephone conversation or meeting, and file it.
This is what lawyers call an ‘attendance note’.
1.128
It can be tempting to think ‘Oh, that was such a short and trivial
conversation I don’t need to make a note’, but try to resist the temptation. If
the conversation was short and seemingly trivial, it won’t take long to note
it anyway – it’ll take you longer to decide whether there could conceivably
be any circumstances in the future in which it might be important to have a
record of it. If it was of any length, it’s bound to need a record. It’s also a
good idea to record the time spent, in case you might want to make an
application for costs or a preparation time order.

Divide your papers into logical categories. The following categories will
often be the only ones you need: (i) correspondence and attendance notes,
with the most recent item on the top; (ii) statements of case and orders – the

claim, the response, any directions from the tribunal, the decision; (iii)
documentary evidence; and (iv) statements. You can keep these sub-files
separate from each other by giving each one its own treasury tag, or
enclosing it in a folded sheet of paper with the name of the category on the
outside, or if your papers are in a ring binder or lever arch file you can use
tabbed divider cards. It’ll save you time if you keep a list of the phone
numbers of all the people you may need to contact about the case on the
inside flap of the file, or somewhere else you can always find it easily. It’s
also a good idea to keep a note of key dates – especially dates by which you
need to do things – somewhere prominent on the file, though that’s no
substitute for diaries and automatic reminders.

Time recording
1.130
Because the tribunals have power in certain circumstances to make
‘preparation time orders’ to compensate parties for the time they have spent
preparing the case, it’s sensible to get into the habit of keeping a running
record of the time you spend on the case. Preparation time can mount up to
a surprising extent: it is much easier to demonstrate this convincingly by
showing the tribunal a record of this kind than by looking back at the work
done weeks or months after the event and trying to estimate how long each
task would have taken. If you are representing yourself remember to record
time that a lawyer might not have to spend – such as time travelling to a
library or to a local print shop to fax a document. Keep a note of any
expenses and itemised telephone bills.
1.131
Probably the simplest method of keeping a rough account of the time
spent on a file is to keep a sheet or two laid out along the lines of the
following precedent at the front of the file, and to try to remember to
complete it at the end of each telephone call or session of work on the case.
Or you could use a time-recording app on your phone or computer: the
information you record still comes from you, obviously, but some tribunals
may find a print-out more convincing than a handwritten list.

Key dates and time limits
1.132
It’s particularly important to establish a reliable habit of noting key dates in
such a way that it is impossible to forget them. There are all kinds of ways
of setting up automatic reminders, though an old-fashioned diary will still
be the most effective for many people. Whatever method you choose,
there’s a pitfall to be avoided at each end of the process. The first is to
forget to make the initial entry. If you’re busy when you’re first consulted
by a new client, you may be tempted to postpone the task of calculating and
noting key dates until a calmer moment. This is a mistake: a calm moment
may not come along for some time, and by the time it does, you may have
forgotten. If you don’t have time to calculate and record key dates at once,
you don’t have time to take on a new case.
1.133
The second pitfall is to set up the reminder, but then to fail to register it
when it falls due. There’s no point noting key dates in a diary that you
rarely open, or setting up a reminder on an e-mail account that you don’t

access every day. It’s far better to link reminders to existing habits than to
try to establish completely new habits: if you already check an e-mail
account daily, you’ll do better to set up an automatic reminder on your email than to resolve to buy a desk diary and look in it every day. If you
already have and constantly use a desk diary, you’ll be better served by an
entry in that.
1.134
It’s beyond the scope of this book to discuss time limits in detail, but two
calculations need to be second nature to employment advisers.32
1.135
The first is the end of the normal time limit for presentation of the claim,
which for the great majority of claims over which the tribunal has
jurisdiction is three months less one day from the date of dismissal (in
complaints about dismissal) or from the act complained of (in the case of
most other complaints). So, for example, if you were dismissed on 5 August
2013, a claim about your dismissal must be received on or before 4
November 2013; ‘before’ is much better than ‘on’.
1.136
Discrimination complaints can present difficulties as there will often be
allegations of a number of discriminatory acts on different dates.
Sometimes it will be possible to argue that these all form part of the same
continuing act, but that argument can be complicated. So if you can, get
your claim in less than 3 months after the earliest of the acts that you want
to complain about.
1.137
If that’s impossible because you put up with mistreatment for months or
years before deciding you had to bring a claim, just present it as soon as
you can.33
1.138
The second crucial calculation is the last day for presentation of an
appeal to the EAT, which is 42 days from the date when the employment
tribunal’s judgment or order is sent to the parties. This means that if the
judgment is sent out on Tuesday 13 August 2013, then the notice of appeal
together with forms ET1 and ET3 and a copy of the judgment appealed
must be received by the EAT before 4 pm on Tuesday 24 September 2013.
1.139

In either case, it’s essential to make sure that the document arrives in
time and complete. This cannot be over-emphasised: there’s no method of
delivery that is 100 per cent fail-safe, and a missed deadline for presenting a
claim or an appeal is the kind of error most likely to wreck your claim
without a hearing (and if you’re an adviser, get you sued for negligence).34
1.140
If a claim in the last few days is unavoidable, the best thing is to submit it
online: you should get an acknowledgement that attaches a pdf of your
form, so you can check that the tribunal has received it. Unfortunately, at
the time of writing, the pdf won’t include any rtf document you have
uploaded with your form, so be particularly careful to make sure that you
keep a copy of that.
1.141
If the time limit isn’t imminent, make sure you check the safe arrival of
your document before it does expire. If a new claim is posted four weeks
before the deadline, but lost in the post, the deadline may have passed by
the time you wonder why you haven’t yet received an acknowledgement
from the tribunal. A document lost in the post won’t usually provide a
sufficient excuse for a late claim or appeal, so make a diary note to find out
what’s happened if you haven’t received an acknowledgement within a
reasonable time.

Interim relief
What it is
1.142
Interim relief is an order that preserves your employment (at least so far as
pay is concerned) until after the tribunal has decided your claim for unfair
dismissal. That’s very valuable: even if you ultimately lose your claim, you
will have been paid meanwhile; and you won’t have to pay the money back.

When you can get it
1.143
Interim relief is only available if you are complaining of dismissal for one
of a limited number of specific kinds of reason. These are:

protected disclosure (otherwise known as ‘whistle-blowing’): when
you say that the reason you have been dismissed is that you have
raised certain kinds of concerns, normally but not exclusively about
unlawful conduct;
certain kinds of trade union-related activities;
a reason relating to a prohibited list (that is to say, a ‘blacklist’ of trade
union members or activists);
your performance of your duties as a workers’ representative in
relation to health and safety, an occupational pension scheme or the
Working Time Regulations;
for exercising or seeking to exercise the right to be accompanied to a
meeting to discuss a request not to retire, or for accompanying or
seeking to accompany a colleague at such a meeting.
1.144
If you think you have been dismissed because of trade union activities or
blacklisting, you need to get in touch urgently with the union to get their
advice and help with an interim relief claim if appropriate. There are certain
additional formalities in trade union cases that we don’t deal with here.
1.145
Whistle-blowing dismissal is the most likely source of a right to claim
interim relief. If you think you have good evidence that this is the reason
you were dismissed, you should consider an application for interim relief
before you do anything else.

Deciding whether to try for interim relief
1.146
Because of the very short deadline for claiming interim relief, applying for
it means working fast. The usual warnings about the cost of instructing
lawyers are relevant, only more so: urgent work tends to be more expensive
than non-urgent work; and your choice of lawyer is likely to be more
restricted than if you had a couple of months to play with.
1.147
Time for making a considered decision about whether or not to go ahead
with the application at all will be squeezed, too: you and your adviser will

be making decisions under considerable pressure of time with less
information and less thought than you’d like. The result could be that you
spend a lot of money making an urgent application that you’d actually have
been better advised not to pursue if there had been more time to consider its
strength. Getting free representation in time for an application for interim
relief will be even more difficult. Lawyers in Citizens Advice Bureaux and
Law Centres are almost always rushed off their feet: even if you’re lucky
enough to get help, it can easily take several weeks just to get an
appointment.
1.148
All of this means that if you want to try for interim relief, you may not
have much realistic option other than to make the application yourself.

How likely are you to get it?
1.149
Not very. You have to persuade the tribunal – normally on the basis of your
claim form and documentary evidence alone – that you are ‘likely’ to win
the underlying claim; for example, that you are likely to persuade the
tribunal that conducts the final hearing that you were dismissed because of
a protected disclosure. ‘Likely’ has been held to mean something more than
‘having a reasonable prospect of success.’
1.150
In practice, the documentary evidence of the right kind of prohibited
reason will normally need to be pretty strong for it to be worthwhile trying
for interim relief. In particular, ‘I know that’s why they dismissed me, and
I’m sure I can prove it if I cross-examine the managers’ will not be enough:
you probably won’t get the chance to cross-examine anyone at the interim
relief hearing.

What you have to do
1.151
What you have to do to claim interim relief is basically the same as what
you have to do to complain of unfair dismissal, only faster.
1.152
Specifically:

complete and present an ET1: see paras 2.35–2.70;
pay the fee or send in an application for remission.
1.153
You have to mention that you want interim relief. There’s no special part of
the form to fill in to do this, so at section 8.1, tick the box for ‘I am making
another type of claim which the Employment Tribunal can deal with,’ and
write in ‘interim relief: I am claiming unfair dismissal by reason of [insert
your reason].’
1.154
Once the tribunal has your claim, it is likely to list it for hearing very
quickly; so don’t wait for the notice of hearing – get on with preparation for
it as fast as you can. Preparation for the hearing is the same as preparation
for a final hearing; only you won’t have much time to do it, and it will
necessarily be less elaborate. But you’ll want a paginated bundle of relevant
documents (see paras 7.5–7.14), and probably a witness statement (see
paras 5.12–5.53). If colleagues are willing to give evidence in support of
your claim, you’ll want witness statements from them too: see paras 5.3–5.9
on the subject of deciding who you should call. A list of issues is always
helpful: see para 7.28. If there’s time, try to agree the bundle with the other
side; but because of the time pressure, you may well end up with a
claimant’s bundle and a respondent’s bundle. The tribunal will be more
understanding about that than it would be in most hearings.
1.157
If you think there are key documents in your employer’s possession that
will prove your case, you may want to ask them for them. The tribunal
almost certainly won’t be willing to order disclosure of documents before
an interim relief hearing; but the employer may comply voluntarily – and if
they don’t, you may be able to persuade the tribunal that their failure to do
so is suspicious in itself. If you want to do this, ask for the documents as
early as you possibly can, so as to deprive your employer of the opportunity
to say that they were perfectly willing to provide them but couldn’t retrieve
them in the limited time available.

2 In any case, newspaper reports of people claiming millions of pounds are considerably more
common than reports of people receiving millions of pounds.
3 Most employment tribunal cases concern, one way or another, the termination of the employment
relationship, so we refer to the ‘former employer’ here although claims are also occasionally brought

4 This is no criticism of lawyers. It is as reasonable to expect your lawyers to help you decide
whether the emotional costs of litigation are worth incurring as to expect your priest or therapist to
provide legal advice; their expertise is elsewhere.
5 The resolution has to be made privately of course: it will be futile if the employer is aware of it.
6 It is also worth checking motor insurance and any policy attached to credit cards, and any other
membership that might include insurance. Even membership of a football club has been known to
provide this type of benefit.
7 There’s a practical insight of wide application here. Even where aggression may be effective,
always try charm first. The reason is that this way around, you can try both: if charm doesn’t work,
you can still try aggression. But have you ever started with aggression and then backtracked
successfully to charm? It’s tricky.

all primary legislation – that is to say, Acts of Parliament, but secondary legislation is only published

in the form of secondary legislation.
18 The standard practitioners’ book is Chitty on Contracts, (31st edn, Sweet & Maxwell, 2013).
Chitty is very comprehensive, but is likely to be forbiddingly technical for anyone without a legal

aware that there are two different kinds of law operating in this field.
19 Unlike the Court of Appeal, the EAT is not technically bound by its own previous rulings, but will
normally be reluctant to depart from them.

Early conciliation
2.1
At the time of writing, the first step to bringing an employment tribunal
claim is to complete the prescribed form and present it to one of the central
employment tribunal offices; see from para 2.35 below. But at some point in
2014, the government intends to implement compulsory Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) conciliation for most
employment tribunal claims. The timetable published in August 2013
indicated that the relevant provisions were intended to be brought into force
on 6 April 2014, so they won’t be in force before then. If you’re reading
after that date, check the current position.
2.2
Once early conciliation is in force, it will apply to almost all claims that
employment tribunals consider. It is intended to operate as a bar to the
tribunal: if you haven’t complied with the early conciliation requirements,
you won’t be allowed to bring your claim.

What kinds of claims are affected?
2.3
Pretty much any kind of employment tribunal claim you can think of is
affected. There are some exceptions, but most of them are pretty obscure,

and many of them claims that employers rather than employees bring to
tribunals: things like appeals against an improvement or prohibition notice
served on an employer under the Working Time Regulations.
2.4
The main exception for employees to note is interim relief. Because these
claims have to be made in a tearing hurry (see further at para 1.44), it
wouldn’t be practicable to hold proceedings up while ACAS tries to bring
about a settlement.
2.5
The full list of the jurisdictions that trigger the early conciliation process
is at section 18(1) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 (as amended).
2.6
You are also exempt from the early conciliation requirement if someone
else has completed the requirement in proceedings ‘relating to the same
matter’; if you start proceedings to which the requirement doesn’t apply at
the same time as proceedings to which it does; or if ACAS has already been
contacted by the potential respondent to your claim.
2.7
For most practical purposes, if you’re acting for yourself you should
probably ignore the first and third of these exemptions. If you think the first
applies, it means you’re one of a group of employees with similar
complaints. If one of your colleagues has already made a request for early
conciliation, you’re probably exempt. But why take the risk that the tribunal
doesn’t think your claim is quite similar enough to your colleague’s? You
might want to play safe by submitting an early conciliation request anyway.
2.8
If you do that, bear in mind that there could be another pitfall to steer
around. If you’re not exempt, you must start with an early conciliation
request; and the time limit for presenting your claim is adjusted, if
necessary, to allow you to do so. If you are exempt, you don’t have to start
with an early conciliation request; so if you do make an early conciliation
request in circumstances where you don’t actually have to, you won’t get
the benefit of that extension. You’ll need to understand how the extension
operates to see how to avoid that pitfall. See further below at para 2.17.
2.9

If you’re claiming interim relief, don’t waste time with an early
conciliation request: all your energy should be focused on getting your
claim in within 7 days of dismissal.
2.10
It is difficult to imagine that the third exception will ever arise in
practice. How often will employers contact ACAS to say ‘We think our
employee so-and-so might be thinking of suing us. Can you help us to
negotiate with him?’ But in the unlikely event that ACAS contacts you to
say that just this has happened, you won’t need to make a request for early
conciliation yourself.

What do you have to do?
2.11
Fortunately, what you will have to do to meet the early conciliation
requirement isn’t difficult. You will have to complete an ‘early conciliation
request’ on a standard form, and submit it to ACAS either online or by post.
Apart from names and contact details (yours and your employer’s), the form
simply asks what job you did, what are your dates of employment, and what
is the date on which the event you are complaining about took place. It also
asks you to tick a box if you know of any other employees of the same
employer making claims in the same circumstances.
2.12
Significantly, there is no space on the form to describe your claim,
beyond giving the date on which the event(s) you are complaining about
took place. It is clear from the consultation response that there is no
intention to limit claims to matters that have been mentioned to ACAS,
either on the form or in conciliation discussions. It is sensible to give all the
dates on which events took place that you want to complain about, but it’s
most unlikely that failing to mention a particular date will subsequently
prevent you from complaining to the tribunal about something that
happened on that date.

What happens next?
2.13

Once you have submitted your early conciliation request, a conciliation
officer from ACAS should telephone you within 48 hours to discuss your
claim. The conciliation officer’s job is to try to bring about a settlement of
your dispute before you start your employment tribunal claim. It will
mostly be sensible to engage with this attempt, because if it succeeds you
will avoid the stress and delay of going to the tribunal. But it’s not
compulsory for either party to negotiate, and lots of employers will refuse
to make more than a token offer at this stage in the hope – especially now
that there are fees to pay – that you won’t start your claim.
2.14
See chapter 6 below on negotiation generally; many of the same tactical
considerations will apply at this stage as if you negotiate in the course of
proceedings.
2.15
There then follows a period during which the conciliation officer
attempts to bring about a settlement. By default, that period is a month. If
the conciliation officer thinks a settlement is possible, and the parties agree,
she can extend the period. If the period (including any extension) expires
without settlement, the conciliation officer issues an early conciliation
certificate; or if she concludes before the end of the month that settlement is
impossible, she can issue the early conciliation certificate before the end of
the month. The day on which you make your early conciliation request is
called Day A, and the day on which you receive your early conciliation
certificate is called Day B.
2.16
The importance of the early conciliation certificate is that (once early
conciliation is in force: see para 2.17), you’ll need to have it before you can
present your claim: you’ll have to quote the ACAS reference number given
on the certificate on your ET1, or it won’t be accepted.

Early conciliation and time limits
2.17
The early conciliation process can affect the time limit for presenting your
claim. The legislation making these adjustment is opaque and badly drafted;
but the basic rules are that the clock stops from the day after Day A and

doesn’t start again until the day after Day B; and that if even taking that rule
into account your limitation period would expire before a month after Day
B, it’s extended until a month after Day B.
2.18
If you follow these three simple rules in order, you should get your claim
in in time:
1) calculate your normal limitation period (for most claims, 3 months
less a day after the act complained of);
2) make your request for early conciliation before the end of that
period (preferably well before the end);
3) present your claim as soon as you can after you receive your early
conciliation certificate, and certainly within a month of that day.
2.19
If for some reason you want to wait right to the end of your limitation
period before presenting your claim, and you have presented your early
conciliation request at a time when your primary limitation period had more
than a month to run, your limitation period will expire more than a month
after Day B. But if you want to wait more than a month after Day B to
present your claim, be very careful to make sure you get the calculation
right. The need to budget for the issue fee is one reason that might cause
you to delay presenting your claim; do bear in mind that difficulty paying is
most unlikely – except perhaps in the most extreme and unforeseeable
circumstances – to be accepted as an excuse for lateness.
Example
If you’re dismissed on 29 September 2014, without the early conciliation
rules you’d have until 28 December to present your claim. You make your
request for early conciliation only 2 weeks after dismissal, on 13 October.
Your employer makes it clear at once that they’re not willing to negotiate at
all, so you get your early conciliation certificate a week after that, on 20
October. The period of 7 days from 14 October to 20 October doesn’t count
in calculating your limitation period, so you can add 7 days to your period:
you now have until 4 January 2015 to present your claim.

The pitfalls
2.20
If you’re not sure whether you’re exempt from early conciliation or not, you
probably want to play safe – as mentioned above – by making a request for
early conciliation anyway. But this creates its own problem, in that if you
request early conciliation when you don’t actually need to, you won’t get
the benefit of the automatic extension of your limitation period.
2.21
The best way to deal with this is to make sure you apply for early
conciliation soon enough that you will get your early conciliation certificate
(normally about a month after you apply) well before your normal
limitation period expires.
2.22
If you haven’t been able to do that, you may find that your normal
limitation period will expire at before you get your early conciliation
certificate. This puts you in what looks like a bit of a bind: if you present
your claim before you’ve got your early conciliation certificate, it may be
rejected because of that (if the tribunal thinks you weren’t exempt); but if
you wait for the certificate, then if the tribunal thinks you were exempt, it
may be rejected as out of time.
2.23
The solution is to present your claim before the expiry of the original
limitation period, before you’ve got your early conciliation certificate. If the
tribunal rejects your claim for lack of the early conciliation certificate,
apply for reconsideration of the rejection on the basis that either (a) you
didn’t need an early conciliation certificate, because you’re exempt, so the
decision to reject your claim was wrong; or (b) you do need an early
conciliation certificate, but that defect can be remedied by waiting for it and
then sending it in. See para 2.85 for a precedent.
2.24
The other potential pitfall is wanting to complain about issues that occur
after you have requested early conciliation. Your early conciliation request
cannot cover events that haven’t happened when you make it. So if
something happens after your request that you want to include in your
claim, you will need to put in another request.

2.25
Early conciliation isn’t in force at the time of writing, so it’s conceivable
that these problems will have been ironed out by the time it is. If so, we’ll
put details on www.etclaims.co.uk.

Fees
2.26
Fees for employment tribunal claims were introduced with effect from 29
July 2013. Unless you’re eligible for remission, you will have to pay two
fees, one when you present your claim (‘the issue fee’), and another shortly
before the hearing (‘the hearing fee’).

Type A and Type B claims
2.27
For the purposes of fees, claims are divided into two categories: the simpler
type A claims, and more complex type B claims. If you’re just seeking
notice pay, redundancy pay, unauthorised deductions from wages, a written
pay statement, a written statement of your main terms of employment, etc,
you have a type A claim. If you want to complain about unfair dismissal,
discrimination, whistleblowing, etc, you have a type B claim. There’s a
complete list of type A claims in the Employment Tribunals and the
Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013;1 any claim not on that list
is a type B claim.
2.28
Mostly, when people complain of unfair dismissal or discrimination, they
include smaller type A claims (eg for notice pay or holiday pay) at the same
time. If your claim includes both types of claims, you only have to pay the
type B fee: you don’t have to pay a separate fee for the type A claims.
2.29
It’s the issue fee that concerns you at this stage of your claim. It is £160
for type A claims; £250 for type B. If you submit your claim online (which
will be preferable, if you’re able to), you will be told automatically which
fee you have to pay. If you send your claim by post with the wrong fee,
you’ll be given a deadline for payment of the correct fee; but provided you
meet that deadline, your claim won’t be rejected.

2.30
If your ET1 isn’t accompanied by either a fee or a declaration that you
intend to apply for remission, it will be rejected (see below at para 2.76).
It’s particularly important not to get your claim rejected (for this reason or
any other) if you present it close to the end of your limitation period: if you
don’t learn of the rejection until after the end of the limitation period, by the
time you have tried again your claim will be late, and will most likely be
rejected for that reason.

Remission
2.31
You may be eligible for remission if you are on benefits or a low income,
and have very limited savings. If you pay the fee up front, you can still
apply for remission provided you do so within 2 months. But if you’re
eligible for remission, the chances are you can’t afford to pay the fee up
front, so you will need to apply for remission when you present your claim.
2.32
At the time of writing, the HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS)
guidance note T435 says: ‘It is very important that you send your fee or
application for a remission with your claim form.’ But if you present your
claim online, it’s not possible to do that: you are asked to say whether you
intend to apply for remission, but there’s no option to do so online with
your claim form. What you actually have to do is find and print the relevant
form and post it (together with supporting evidence) to the Employment
Tribunal Central Office at PO Box 10218, Leicester LE1 8EG (or if you
have access to DX, at DX 743093, Leicester 35).
2.33
At the right hand side of the page showing your online ET1 form, you
will see a list of ‘other relevant links’. One of them is called ‘How to apply
for remission’. You might think that would take you to some guidance about
how to apply for remission. It doesn’t. It takes you to a search page for
HMCTS forms and leaflets. The one you want is called ‘EX160A’. It’s
listed under ‘leaflets’ rather than ‘forms’, but the leaflet includes the form.
2.34

It’s not clear from any of the official guidance how soon after presenting
your online claim you are supposed to send in your application for
remission. Staff at the employment tribunal enquiry line think it has to
arrive within 7 days of your online claim, but they can’t point to any rule or
guidance that lays down that time limit. In any event, you should certainly
assume that you need to send your form EX160A, with all its supporting
documentation, very promptly after submitting your online ET1. Post your
remission application the same day, if you possibly can.

The ET1
What goes in the ET1
2.35
A complaint to the employment tribunal is made on form ET1. Much of the
form is concerned with general information, such as the name and address
of the parties and the dates of employment. The main narrative part of the
complaint will either be the content of box 8.2, or will be set out in a
separate document that you upload at box 15 or send with a paper form.
Either way, this is your opportunity to set out, reasonably briefly, the story
you want to tell the tribunal.
2.36
The ET1 is the employment tribunal’s equivalent of the claim form in a
civil claim. Its purpose is to explain to the tribunal, and the other party,
what it is your employer did that you are aggrieved about, why you say it
was unlawful, and what you want the tribunal to do about it.
2.37
The tribunal will attach importance to what is, and isn’t, in the ET1.
Anything not in the form is not part of the claim. That means it’s important
to spell out all the legal complaints that you want to raise at this stage. If
you want to bring a claim for unfair dismissal, race discrimination and
unlawful deduction of wages, you must put all three claims in your ET1. If
you just complain about unfair dismissal and race discrimination, the
tribunal will only be willing to consider an unlawful deductions claim if it
later lets you amend your ET1 to add that claim – and you can’t assume it
will. Employment tribunal time limits are strict, and an amendment raising

a new complaint may be treated for the purposes of the time limits as a
separate claim.
2.38
Although it’s vital that the ET1 includes all the claims you want to bring,
that doesn’t mean you have to set out all the evidence at this stage, or argue
the law.
2.39
That’s easy to say, but if you’re not familiar with legal proceedings it
may leave you wondering how exactly you’re supposed to tell the
difference between what does need to go in the ET1 and what doesn’t. This
is quite subtle, and no two lawyers will take exactly the same approach. But
it may help to think about what you have to tell the tribunal in five
categories:
1) facts: what you say happened;
2) evidence (which is another kind of facts, really): why you say the
tribunal should accept your version of what happened;
3) claims: what kind of claims you are making;
4) legal argument: why you say your claims should succeed;
5) remedy: what you say the tribunal should do about it.
2.40
It’s the first, the third and (to an extent) the fifth of these that the tribunal
will want to read about in your ET1. The evidence will be in your bundle of
documents and your witness statements, and if there’s a need for legal
argument, you do that right at the end of the hearing – when you make
what’s called your ‘submissions’ to the tribunal. If you are claiming
compensation, you will probably only be able to give a provisional account
of how much you’re looking for at this stage: the amount will normally
depend on how much you have lost by the time of the hearing, and how
much you expect to lose in the future, as a result of your employer’s
treatment of you.
2.41
How much detail is enough for the ET1 is a question of judgment. It is
always possible to tell a story in more detail: the length of a story can
increase infinitely, like the length of a coastline, depending on how closely
you look at it. ‘I was dismissed and it was unfair and discriminatory’ is

inadequate: the tribunal and the other side will need to know whether
you’re alleging actual or constructive dismissal, whether you say you were
dismissed for an automatically unfair reason (like whistleblowing, or
asserting your statutory rights), or that the procedure your employer
followed was unfair, or that dismissal was a disproportionate response to
what you did, or both; and they’ll want to know what kind of discrimination
you’re complaining about: are you saying you suffered discrimination on
grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or what? Direct
or indirect?
2.42
On the other hand, if you give word-for-word accounts of conversations
in your ET1 and quote at length from the company handbook or minutes of
meetings, you’re probably going detail that could safely be left to the
witness statements – or left out altogether. If you compare precedents
P2.47.2 and P5.53.2 below you should start to get a feel for the difference
between the ET1 and the witness statement.
2.43
Bear in mind that the ET1 will be the first thing the tribunal reads at the
beginning of the case. When they read it, they will know nothing about the
case. It is important to give them enough information for them to
understand your claim and begin to be convinced by it. A well-written,
well-organised and plausible ET1 can go a long way towards winning a
case.
2.44
A good way of testing whether a draft claim has included all the
essentials is to ask the question: if I prove everything I have asserted here,
will I win the case? If the tribunal can’t allow your claim without finding
additional facts not set out in the ET1, then you haven’t included everything
you should have.
2.45
For example, to make an award for unauthorised deductions from wages,
the tribunal will need to be satisfied:
that you were entitled under your contract of employment to be paid
certain amounts;

that your employer paid you less than the amount to which you were
entitled on one or more occasions;
that you had not authorised the deduction(s) in writing; and
that there was no statutory or contractual authority for the deductions.
2.46
So each of these elements needs to be present in your ET1.
2.47
The first precedent following shows the entire form completed for a
disability discrimination claim. The second precedent shows the additional
pages that would be attached to the form (or uploaded if the claim is
submitted online), but not the form itself.

PRECEDENT 2.47.2: ET1 details of claim for disability
discrimination – Pauline Phelps2
1. The claimant suffers from depression and agoraphobia and has a facial
disfigurement. She has suffered from these conditions for all of her life. She
has a disability within the meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010.
2. The claimant was first employed by Sharpe, Gentleman & Co as a
secretary in June 1996. It was a fundamental term of her contract of
employment that the respondent would not act in a manner calculated to
destroy the trust and confidence that should exist between employer and
employee.
3. The claimant was interviewed for the post by Alistair Gentleman and his
then secretary, Margaret Church. At the interview she explained that
because of her facial disfigurement she was shy with new people and would
prefer to work somewhere quiet where she would not have to deal with the
public. Mr Gentleman assured her that that would not be a problem. Before
she started work she filled in a form for the respondent about her general
health. On the form she indicated that she had suffered from severe
depression in the past, but that she was not at that time receiving any
treatment.3
4. The claimant worked for Mr Gentleman until his retirement in July 2013.
She was happy in the role and Mr Gentleman made it clear that he was very
satisfied with her work. She sat in an inner-office adjoining Mr Gentleman’s
room on the third floor of the building where she never encountered clients.
During the 24 years she worked for Mr Gentleman the claimant never took
a day’s sick leave. Her depression recurred from time to time and she took
anti-depressants for three periods of a year or two each during this time, but
she was able to continue working on each occasion. Mr Gentleman was
aware of her condition and was understanding if she was depressed or
tearful at work.
5. At the time of Mr Gentleman’s retirement there were four partners in the
firm, 10 further fee-earners, nine secretaries and two part-time receptionists.

The claimant and another three secretaries each worked full-time for the
four partners, and the other six formed a pool that shared the work
generated by the 10 assistant solicitors. The appointment of one of the
assistant solicitors, Madeleine Grey, as a new partner had been announced
to take effect from September 2013.
6. Shortly after Mr Gentleman’s retirement, Mr Sharpe told the claimant
that he wanted her to join the pool of secretaries. Members of the pool
worked in a large open-plan office on the ground floor of the building, and
they had to pass through the public waiting room to enter or leave the
building or to get to the kitchenette or the toilet. The claimant told Mr
Sharpe that she would find this difficult and stressful, but he refused to
consider her suggestion that she should work full-time for Miss Grey.
7. The claimant started work in the pool on 18 August 2013. She found it
stressful from the first day. All of the other members of the pool were in
their twenties, so at 50 the claimant was the eldest by more than 20 years.
The working environment was noisy and the claimant found the other
secretaries’ conversations distracting. She also became convinced that they
disliked her. During the week beginning 18 August 2013, four different
temporary secretaries worked in the pool for a day or two each.
8. On 25 August 2013 the claimant went to see Mr Sharpe to ask him to
move her to a different room. She was distressed and in tears at several
points during his meeting. She explained that the environment in the room
used by the pool was very difficult for her and was affecting her ability to
concentrate on her work, that she had recently started to have difficulty
sleeping and that she was worried about the effect on her health. She said
that she was afraid she would get depressed again. Mr Sharpe told her that
he knew it was a big change for her but that she had shown herself to be a
survivor in the past and he was sure she would get used to it in time.
9. The claimant continued to work for the next few weeks, but became
increasingly depressed and anxious. Finally on 24 October 2013 she had a
panic attack on the way to work and was picked up by the police shaking
and crying at the wheel of her car. She was admitted to hospital for two
nights and was then signed off work for 12 weeks by her GP, who also
prescribed anti-depressants.

10. When the claimant returned to work on 9 January 2014, the other
members of the secretarial pool welcomed her warmly. They had arranged
between them to place her desk in a corner partly screened from the rest of
the room by pot plants, and she became aware that they were making a real
effort to keep noise levels in the room down. The claimant felt better able to
cope, but she continued to find the working environment stressful. She was
often tearful by the end of the day, and she had difficulty sleeping. She
started to work additional hours in the evenings to catch up on work that
she felt she should have been able to do during the day.
11. On 16 February 2014 the claimant’s GP wrote to Mr Sharpe explaining
that her mental health was suffering from the conditions in which she was
working and asking him to consider moving her to a different room. He
explained that the claimant was taking anti-depressants and that he did not
think it was likely that she would be able to stop taking them unless her
work situation improved considerably. Mr Sharpe did not reply to this letter.
12. At the end of February 2014, one of the respondent’s receptionists
started a period of maternity leave and it was announced that her position
would be covered during her absence by the pool secretaries on a rota.
When the first rota was circulated on 2 March 2014, the claimant was
horrified to see her name on it. She went to see Mr Sharpe in tears and told
him that she could not possibly sit at the front desk dealing with members
of the public. He told her that it would not be fair on the other secretaries if
he took her off the rota and said that it would probably be good for her. He
said that as she was obviously upset she should go home straightaway that
day and get a good night’s sleep. He said he hoped she would feel calmer in
the morning.
13. The claimant went to see her GP the next day and was signed off sick
for eight weeks.
14. The claimant sent the respondent a written grievance on 8 May 2014
and a letter of resignation on 11 May 2014.
15. The respondent was in breach of the trust and confidence term of the
claimant’s contract of employment in the following ways:

a) in refusing to consider her suggestion that she might work full-time for
Miss Grey, despite being aware of the reasons why she was bound to find
the secretarial pool a difficult working environment;
b) in refusing on 25 August 2014 to consider moving the claimant to
work in a different room despite her evident distress;
c) in failing to reply to the letter of 16 February 2014 from her GP;
d) in imposing on her on 2 March 2014 the requirement that she provide
reception cover on a rota despite knowing that this was bound to cause
her extreme distress and was likely to be injurious to her health.
16. In presenting her resignation on 11 May 2014 the claimant has accepted
the respondent’s repudiation of her contract of employment and is therefore
constructively dismissed.
17. The respondent’s dismissal of the claimant was unfair, and the claimant
seeks a basic award and compensation for unfair dismissal.
18. The following provisions, criteria or practices adopted by the
respondent placed the claimant at a substantial disadvantage in comparison
with persons who were not disabled:
a) the requirement from August 2013 that the claimant work as a ‘pool’
secretary instead of being assigned to a specific fee-earner or fee-earners;
b) the requirement from August 2013 that the claimant work in the openplan office shared by members of the pool;
c) the requirement that she provide reception cover on a rota from March
2014.
19. It was the duty of the respondent to take such steps as it was reasonable
in all the circumstances for it to have to take in order to prevent these
matters from placing the claimant at a disadvantage. The respondent did not
take any such steps and has accordingly discriminated against the claimant
contrary to the Equality Act 2010.
20. The claimant claims compensation for disability discrimination
including damages for injury to feelings and interest.

PRECEDENT 2.47.3: ET1 details of claim for unfair
dismissal – Saifur Rahman
1. The claimant started working for the hospital as a porter in December
2009. His job was to transport patients and equipment from one part of the
hospital to another, as instructed by medical staff.
2. The claimant was employed on an initial probationary period of six
months. In about May 2010 he attended a probationary review meeting at
which his line manager, Mark Bowland, congratulated him on his
performance and told him that his employment would be confirmed. He
was given a letter confirming this the next day.
3. There were no further formal appraisals, but the claimant was never
given any reason to believe that there were any concerns about his
performance, and in November 2010 he was promoted to the position of
supervising porter.
4. On 26 March 2014, the claimant was sent to Coventry Ward, a geriatric
ward, to collect a patient for physiotherapy. As he reached the ward he
heard the ward sister, Lorraine Winston, say to a junior nurse ‘Give him
some Somnex, it’s the only way we’ll get any peace round here. Don’t put it
on his chart or the doctor will create’. When the Sister saw that he had
heard her she looked embarrassed and said ‘Only joking’.
5. The claimant was concerned about this. He knew that Somnex was a
powerful prescription sedative, and he thought it sounded as if a patient was
being given it without a prescription to keep him quiet. He reported his
concerns on the same day to Mr Bowland, but Mr Bowland refused to take
any action.
6. On 2 April 2014 the claimant wrote to the Chief Executive of the
Hospital about what he had overheard. This was a protected disclosure
within the meaning of section 43A of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
7. On 3 April 2014 the Chief Executive replied promising that his allegation
would be looked into, and on 13 April 2014 the claimant received a letter

from Martin Ogunfowora, a human resources manager at the hospital,
saying that his allegation had been thoroughly investigated and no evidence
of unauthorised medication had been found.
8. On 16 April 2014, when the claimant visited the Coventry Ward to
collect Mrs Goody for another physiotherapy session, Sister Winston said to
him, ‘You’re toast’. He said ‘What do you mean?’ but she just said, ‘You’re
toast. Just you wait’.
9. On 17 April 2014 the claimant received a letter dated 16 April from
Maisie Lee, another human resources manager. The letter said that he had
been accused of swearing at a Sister in the presence of patients and junior
nurses and he was suspended with immediate effect and invited to a
disciplinary hearing at 10.30 am on 27 April 2014. It enclosed copies of
statements from Sister Winston and two other nurses from the Coventry
Ward. All the statements said that when Sister Winston had asked him why
he was late to collect a patient on 16 April he had shouted, ‘I’ve had enough
of your fucking nagging. Why don’t you take the fucking patient yourself if
you’re in such a hurry?’ The statements said he had then wheeled the
patient’s wheelchair out of the ward so fast that the patient had cried out in
alarm, and slammed the door behind him.
10. At the disciplinary hearing on 27 April 2014 the panel refused to
believe the claimant when he said that this allegation was completely
untrue. When he tried to tell them about the concern he had raised about
medication of a patient in the Coventry Ward the chairman of the panel
insisted that that was a completely separate matter that had been
investigated already and had no relevance to the disciplinary proceedings.
When he asked them if they had spoken to Mrs Goody, one member of the
panel said that that would have been completely inappropriate.
11. The chairman of the panel asked the claimant if he would apologise to
Sister Winston if they decided not to dismiss him. The claimant said that he
would not, because the allegation was a complete fabrication.
12. At the end of the disciplinary hearing the claimant was dismissed for
gross misconduct. When he asked about an appeal, the chairman told him
that the only way an appeal could succeed was if he offered to apologise to

Sister Winston. The claimant was not prepared to admit untrue allegations,
so when he received the dismissal letter he did not appeal.
13. When the claimant told Penny Short, a student nurse he was friendly
with, about his dismissal, she told him that she had seen him collect the
patient on 16 April 2014 and could have confirmed that he had collected
Mrs Goody quietly and without incident. She said that no one had asked her
what she had seen or heard.
14. On 4 May 2014 the claimant started to look for advice on a potential
unfair dismissal claim against the hospital. Between 4 and 12 May he
telephoned eight different advice agencies, most of which could not offer
him an appointment at all. Finally the Care Workers’ Advice Project
(CWAP) offered him an appointment on 10 June 2014. He attended that
appointment, but on arrival he was told that the adviser he was due to see
was off work that day. He was not able to get another appointment until 26
June 2014. On 26 June, the adviser at the CWAP told him that he would
have to appeal the decision to dismiss him and wait 28 days before he could
present a claim. He was also told that he had until 27 October to present his
claim to the tribunal.4
15. The adviser also told him that public interest disclosure cases were very
complicated and he ought to see a solicitor. She made an appointment for
the claimant to see a solicitor at the North London Law Centre at 4.00 pm
on 3 August 2014.
16. Accordingly the claim is out of time. The claimant asserts that it was
not reasonably practicable for him to present his claim by 26 July and that
he has presented it promptly as soon as he was aware that it was late.
17. The reason or principal reason for the claimant’s dismissal was that he
had made protected disclosures, to Mark Bowland on 26 March 2014, and
by his letter of 2 April 2014 to the Chief Executive. His dismissal was
therefore automatically unfair.
18. Further or alternatively the claimant’s dismissal was unfair because:
a) the respondent did not adequately investigate the allegations against
the claimant, and in particular failed to make inquiries of either Mrs

Goody or Penny Short;
b) the disciplinary panel was not provided with full information about the
reason why Sister Winston might have a grudge against him;
c) he was denied an effective right of appeal.
19. The claimant seeks compensation for unfair dismissal.

Drafting the ET1
2.48
If you are acting for yourself, writing your ET1 is probably your first
experience of legal writing. Like many legal tasks, it’s not as mysterious as
it seems at first.
2.49
It’s probably helpful to work in two stages.

Stage 1: what you say happened
2.50
Start by writing down the story of your case. Structure is important here.
It’s much harder to follow a story that jumps around in time, or in which the
reasons why things happened aren’t clear. If the tribunal is to believe your
story, the first thing it has to do is understand it. So just write down the facts
that form the basis of your claim, in the order in which things happened
(that is to say, in ‘chronological’ order), and in numbered paragraphs. The
point at this stage is to tell the tribunal what you say happened that gives
you a right to compensation or some other remedy. You don’t have to tell
them all about why they should believe your version of what happened: that
comes later, in your witness statement. And at this stage, you don’t need to
talk about the law at all. You don’t need to say ‘this was sex discrimination
contrary to the Equality Act 2010 because ...’ or ‘this was unfair because
...’. Just tell them what happened.
2.51
Make sure the story doesn’t have any puzzling gaps in it. That’s quite
hard to do with a story that you have lived through: you know it too well to
be able to see what you have left out. If you can, get someone else to read

it, and ask them if they understand what you say happened, and whether it
leaves them wanting to ask ‘But why?’ at any point.

Stage 2: in what way you say it was unlawful
2.52
Once you’ve finished telling the story, you need to say what you want the
tribunal to make of it. This is the moment to say what your claims are, in
legal terms. It still isn’t the place for legal argument. You don’t have to
quote cases or recite bits of legislation; but you do need to explain whether
you say the things that the respondent did amount to sex discrimination, or
race discrimination, or disability discrimination, or unfair dismissal, or a
breach of contract (and so on). If you say you’ve suffered discrimination,
you will almost certainly have to explain a bit more: you’ll need to say
whether you think you have suffered direct discrimination (they treated you
worse because of your sex, race etc) or indirect discrimination (they applied
a provision, criterion or practice to you that put you at a disadvantage
compared to members of other groups, and they can’t justify it), or
discrimination by way of victimisation (they treated you badly because you
had raised other complaints of discrimination previously), and so on.
2.53
This part can get quite complicated. Often you won’t know for sure how
best to put your claim. You may have to draft alternative claims – this was
direct discrimination on grounds of sex, but if it wasn’t, it was indirect
discrimination on grounds of sex; then again it may have been
victimisation. But when you come to write this part, your task will be easier
if you have first set out the story clearly in numbered paragraphs. That’s
because you’ll be able to refer back to those paragraphs and say things like
‘In doing the acts referred to at paragraphs X to Y above, the respondent
treated the claimant (or if you prefer ‘my employer treated me’) less
favourably than it would have treated a man in the same circumstances.’

Accuracy
2.54
The accuracy of the ET1 is vital. This sounds obvious, but it’s important to
realise how difficult it can be to achieve.

2.55
You meet your adviser and tell your story. The lawyer takes notes during
the meeting, and then sits down later to draft the ET1. At each stage of this
process, errors and misunderstandings can creep in. You may say something
slightly different from what you mean; then your adviser may note down
something that isn’t quite what you said. Then she types a statement using
her handwritten notes, but doesn’t quite read her own handwriting correctly.
By the time the form is finished, these small errors may add up to some
quite serious inaccuracies. At this point you may assume that your adviser
has some good reason for presenting things in that way; and she assumes
that if you saw there was something wrong in your statement, you’d say so.
2.56
This is less likely to happen if you are completing the form yourself, but
even so it’s surprisingly easy for mistakes to creep in.
2.57
These mistakes can cause problems later on. If what your ET1 says isn’t
quite right, and you haven’t corrected it by the time of the hearing, you are
likely to be asked to explain it in cross-examination. Even if you have
corrected it, you may be asked why you have changed your story.
2.58
So read and re-read your draft before submitting it. This is a good reason
(one of several) not to leave drafting your claim to the last possible minute.
You’ll do a much better job of picking up errors in something you’ve
written yourself if you come back to it a day or two after the first draft than
if you try to do the whole job in a single sitting.

Completing and presenting the form
2.59
The official ET1 form is compulsory: if you want to claim, you have to use
it. You can either submit the form online, or you can print it and post it to
Employment Tribunal Central Office (England and Wales), PO Box 10218,
Leicester LE1 8EG or Employment Tribunals Central Office (Scotland), PO
Box 27105, Glasgow, G2 9JR as appropriate. If you’re working for an
organisation that has DX, the DX numbers are DX 743093, Leicester 35
and DX 580003, Glasgow 17. You can’t e-mail or fax the form.

2.60
Submit your claim online if you can: that way you should get an
immediate acknowledgment by e-mail, so there’s less scope for mishap or
argument about exactly when your claim was presented. Notes on the form
itself go so far as to say ‘We would like to remind you that forms submitted
online are processed much faster than ones posted to us’, though it does
actually seem unlikely that this will make any significant difference to how
long it takes your case to come to a hearing.
2.61
But although it’s probably best to present your claim online, there are a
few fiddly problems with the online form that you need to be aware of.
2.62
First, if you remain on any given page of it for more than 20 minutes, it
will time out and you’ll lose the information you have entered. That’s an
irritation rather than a disaster – unless you’re trying to complete the form
shortly before midnight on your last day for claiming. Give yourself time
for some mishaps, and don’t complete the form on the last day if you can
possibly help it. You may find it easiest to print the form first and complete
a draft by hand, and then enter the details online reasonably briskly from
your handwritten draft.
2.63
The page headed ‘Multiple Claims’ asks ‘Do you know if your claim is
one of a number of claims against the same employer and is arising from
the same or similar circumstances?’ That’s badly drafted, but in the context
it must be taken to mean ‘Is your claim one of a number of claims against
the same employer, so far as you’re aware?’ So give the answer ‘no’ if you
know or believe that it isn’t. Only answer ‘yes’ if you believe that one or
more of your colleagues is making a similar claim.
2.64
The page headed ‘Type and details of claim’ contains rather a serious
pitfall. After you have ticked whichever of the small boxes relates to your
claim (‘I was unfairly dismissed’, etc), there’s a box for you to describe
what happened. The form warns that you mustn’t enter more than 70 lines
of text in this box: if you do, it warns, the additional lines won’t appear in
the pdf version of your form.
2.65

But at the time of writing, although the warning says the box is limited to
70 lines, your text actually gets cut off after line 63. So unless you can set
out a reasonably complete account of your claim in about 60 lines, you’re
going to need to attach a separate document later in the form – on the page
headed ‘Additional information’. You could start your draft in the box and
then complete it in your attached rtf file, but it’s probably clearer to put it
all in one place. So write something like ‘see attached rtf document’ in this
box. You have to write something in the box, or you won’t be allowed to
proceed.
2.66
Then when it comes to the page headed ‘Additional information’ you can
upload your separate document. You can’t attach a Word document: it has
to be an rtf file. If you don’t know what that means, don’t panic. Write your
content in a Word document; choose ‘save as’ from the ‘file’ menu, and
then pick ‘Rich Text Format’ from the ‘format’ drop-down list. Then upload
that document (which will have a name like ET1.rtf) to the additional
information page.
2.67
Unfortunately there’s a respect in which this process is a bit
unsatisfactory, too. The pdf version of your form that is sent to you with the
automatic acknowledgement won’t include your uploaded document; so
you won’t get the chance to double-check immediately after submission that
you’ve uploaded the right thing.
2.68
If you’re worried about that, one possibility is to write a summary of the
most important features of your claim into the ‘type and details of claim’
box, and then attach a fuller version under ‘additional information’. That
way, even if your rtf file somehow gets lost in transmission, you should still
have done enough to start your claim. See paras 2.88–2.90 for guidance on
how to write a very succinct summary of your claim.
2.69
If you decide to present your form by post, you can either print it out and
then complete it by hand; or you can type your information in the boxes
provided and then print and post it. Do the latter if you can: handwriting is
always harder to read. Here too, box 8.2 (‘background and details’) may not
give you enough space to say what you want to say. You can either start in

box 8.2 and continue at box 15 (‘additional information’); or you can write
‘please see separate sheets attached’ at box 8.2 and then include a separate
document with your form.
2.70
In theory, the latter seems to create a slight risk of difficulties: the ‘check
list and cover sheet’ at page 16 of the pdf form asks you not to attach a
covering letter, but to include any further relevant information in section 15
(‘additional information’) instead. But if boxes 8.2 and 15 together don’t
give you enough space to set out the details of your claim, you don’t have
much option. Early indications are that tribunals are accepting additional
pages with ET1s just as they always used to, and it seems unlikely that this
will suddenly change.

Checking that your form has arrived
2.71
Once you’ve presented your form, you’ll want to be sure that it has arrived
safely. If you present your form online, you should get an e-mail
acknowledgment within a few minutes of sending it. If you’re an adviser
completing the form on behalf of a client, you’ll be dismayed to learn that
the acknowledgment is sent to your client, and not copied to you. That’s
pretty unhelpful, especially if you’re working close to a deadline. Ask your
client to look out for the acknowledgment, and forward it to you as soon as
it arrives.
2.72
Notes at the end of the form say this:
If your claim has been submitted online or posted in with the appropriate
fee you should receive confirmation of receipt from the office dealing
with your claim within five working days. If you have not heard from
them within five days, please contact that office directly. If the deadline
for submitting the claim is closer than five days you should check that it
has been received before the time limit expires.
2.73
That seems to mean that you can’t rest assured that your claim is safely
presented until you’ve had an acknowledgment from the local office dealing

with your claim. The automatic acknowledgment that you should get within
minutes of presenting your claim tells you which one that is, with contact
details, so make a note to check that you’ve had an acknowledgment from
them before the limitation period expires.
2.74
If you have problems presenting your claim, don’t rest too much hope on
the public enquiry line (0845 795 9775). I rang it repeatedly in the course of
writing this: mostly it went straight to a message saying ‘all our operatives
are busy; please try later’, or else rang without any answer until
disconnected. The one time I did get through, I spoke to someone who told
me that he or she was one of was one of five full-time and one part-time
staff employed to answer employment tribunal queries for the whole
country.
2.75
One final glitch. If you present your form online, you should get an email acknowledgment almost at once, attaching a pdf copy. But a bit
confusingly, you’ll find at the bottom of that pdf the message: ‘You have
opted to print and post your form ...’ followed by encouragement to submit
it online instead. This is nonsense; ignore it.

Rejection of the ET1
2.76
The procedure rules say (at rule 11) that the tribunal will reject a claim in
five circumstances:
1) where it’s not presented on the prescribed form (ET1);
2) where it’s not accompanied by either the tribunal fee or an
application for fee remission;
3) where any of the minimum information has not been included (that
is, where any of the following is missing: each claimant’s name;
each claimant’s address; each respondent’s name; and each
respondent’s address);
4) where it is one the tribunal has no power to consider;
5) where it is in a form which cannot sensibly be responded to or is
otherwise an abuse of the process.

2.77
The first of these is self-explanatory: you have to use the form, and if you
don’t, your claim will be rejected.
2.78
The second is odd, since if you do what you are strongly encouraged to
do and present your claim online, it can’t be accompanied by an application
for remission: all you can do online is say that you plan to apply for
remission. Presumably that’s good enough, provided your remission
application arrived in the post within a few days: see paras 2.32–2.34
above.
2.79
The third will presumably be fairly rare, and (so long as there’s still
time), easy enough to put right. Using the online form should guard against
this kind of error, because if you miss out required information, it won’t let
you proceed to the next page.
2.80
Rejection on the ground that the tribunal doesn’t have power to consider
the claim is obviously much more serious. But it needn’t be fatal. If the
tribunal’s entitlement to consider the claim is in doubt, then that question
will have to be considered at some point, so there is no particular
disadvantage to you in having it made the subject of a decision at a
preliminary stage.
2.81
The last of the grounds for rejection is new in the 2013 rules. It is
worrying, because lots of claims drafted by people who are not used to legal
drafting may be said to be ‘in a form which cannot sensibly be responded
to’. Drafting a claim is quite difficult, and not everyone will be able to make
much of a stab at it on the first attempt. The obvious solution to that is to
tell them what information they need to add, and give them another chance.
But if your claim is rejected for this reason, then unless you have made your
first attempt well inside the time limit, the likelihood is that by the time you
try again you will be too late.
2.82
It’s not yet clear how this rule is going to be operated in practice, but it
certainly creates a danger of getting your claim rejected not because there’s

anything fundamentally wrong with it, but just because on your first attempt
you didn’t express it very clearly.
2.83
If you believe that your claim has been wrongly rejected, you should
apply for reconsideration of the rejection under rule 13 of the procedure
rules. You can apply for reconsideration either on the basis that you can
remedy the defect that caused the claim to be rejected, or on the basis that
the decision to reject your claim was wrong.
2.84
You have 14 days from the date when the notice of rejection was sent to
you to apply for reconsideration of the decision to reject it. If the reason
you’re asking for reconsideration is that you think you can remedy the
defect, you will probably need to move very fast: if you do succeed in
remedying the defect, your claim will be treated as presented on the date
you did so, not on the date you originally submitted it. This is another good
reason to present your claim early if you can. If your argument is that the
decision to reject was just wrong, and you succeed, your claim will be
treated as having been presented on the day you first submitted it.
2.85
The next precedent makes both arguments in the alternative.

PRECEDENT 2.85: Application for reconsideration of
rejection – Bill Parker
The Regional Secretary
London South Employment Tribunal
Montague Court, 101 London Road
West Croydon, Surrey
CR0 2RF
Your ref: 123456/2014
My ref: NC/1234
3 September 2014
Dear Madam

Bill Parker v Action in Rural Sussex for the Elderly (1) and Eastbourne,
Lewis & Brighton Older Workers (2)
APPLICATION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF REJECTION: RULE 19
Thank you for your letter of 30 August 2014 notifying me of the rejection
of this claim because it did not quote the reference number from an early
conciliation certificate.
Mr Parker was dismissed on 14 May 2014, close to the date of a possible
transfer of the undertaking in which he was employed from the 1st
Respondent to the 2nd Respondent. His complaint is of unfair dismissal
(including automatically unfair dismissal under TUPE), and for unpaid
redundancy pay. Several of Mr Parker’s colleagues were dismissed at the
same time, and to the best of his belief at least one of them has presented a
similar complaint, although possibly against only one of the two
Respondents. Mr Parker’s former colleagues have been ostracising him for
some months following unsubstantiated allegations against him about his
conduct in the workplace. It is not necessary to go into the details of that
here; the practical effect is that none of his former colleagues is willing to
discuss with him any claims they may be bringing.
Mr Parker sought my advice on 11 August 2014. It was not possible for me
to determine with certainty whether he was or was not exempt from the
early conciliation requirement by reason of another person’s claim relating
to the same matter. I presented his claim on 12 August, and Mr Parker made
a request for early conciliation on the same day; but he has not yet received
his early conciliation certificate.
In the circumstances, I request reconsideration of the rejection of his claim
on the following alternative grounds:
(a) the decision to reject was wrong, because Mr Parker was exempt from
early conciliation by reason of the institution of proceedings by one or more
of his colleagues relating to the same matter, so that his claim was not
defective;
(b) if the claim as presented was defective, the defect can be remedied by
notifying the tribunal of the early conciliation reference number as soon as
the early conciliation certificate is received.

Yours faithfully
Natalie Cummings

The employer’s response
2.86
This is a book primarily for claimants and their advisers, so we don’t
include advice on how to respond to a claim. But Pauline Phelps and Saifur
Rahman’s cases are used as examples throughout the book, so we’d better
see what their respective employers have to say for themselves. Here are
their ET3s:
P2.86.1

PRECEDENT 2.86.1: Employer’s response – Pauline
Phelps
IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No 123456/14
BRISTOL
BETWEEN
PAULINE PHELPS
Claimant
and
SHARPE, GENTLEMAN & CO SOLICITORS
Respondent
GROUNDS OF RESISTANCE
1. The respondent is a high street firm of solicitors, founded in 1922. It
currently has five partners and employs 12 non-partner fee-earners.
2. The respondent admits that the claimant has at all material times had a
facial disfigurement. The respondent does not admit that the claimant
suffers from depression or agoraphobia, or that she is disabled within the

meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010. The respondent was not
aware, and had no reason to believe, that the claimant considered herself
disabled until it received her grievance dated 8 May 2014.
3. Paragraph 2 of the claim is admitted, save that the ‘trust and confidence’
term was that the respondent would not without reasonable and proper
cause conduct itself in a manner likely to destroy the relationship of trust
and confidence between employer and employee.5
4. The respondent admits the first sentence of paragraph 3. It is denied that
the claimant’s disfigurement was discussed at the interview, or that Mr
Gentleman gave the claimant any assurances about the circumstances in
which she would work. It is denied that the claimant said anything about
depression on any form that she filled in for the respondent.
5. The respondent admits that the claimant worked as Mr Gentleman’s
secretary until his retirement in July 2013, and that her work was generally
satisfactory. The respondent makes no admission as to how happy she was
in her work. It is admitted that the claimant sat in an inner office adjoining
Mr Gentleman’s room on the 3rd floor of the building, but her assertion that
she never encountered clients there is denied. Mr Gentleman often saw
clients in his room when the respondent’s meeting rooms were all engaged,
and on those occasions the claimant would provide tea and coffee.
6. The respondent admits that its records do not show that the claimant took
any sick leave while she worked for Mr Gentleman. No admission is made
as to any episodes of depression suffered by the claimant during this time.
7. It is admitted that Mr Sharpe, the respondent’s managing partner, directed
the claimant to join the pool of secretaries on Mr Gentleman’s retirement.
The claimant’s description of the office layout is agreed.
8. It is denied that the claimant told Mr Sharpe that she would find it
difficult and stressful working in the room used by the pool secretaries. The
claimant objected to Mr Sharpe’s proposal because she saw it as a
demotion. Mr Sharpe assured her that it was not a demotion, and her
seniority and status were unaffected. The claimant did suggest that she
should work full-time for Miss Grey, but this was impracticable because
Miss Grey types most of her own correspondence and does not require a

full-time secretary. In any event, the respondent took a policy decision in
2008 to phase out the use of secretaries assigned to individual solicitors in
favour of more flexible use of the pool secretaries.
9. Paragraph 5 is admitted.
10. The first sentence of paragraph 7 is admitted. The respondent does not
make any admission as to the second sentence.
11. It is denied that all the other secretaries in the pool were in their
twenties. Including the claimant, there were seven members of the pool, and
three of those were in their thirties. The atmosphere in the pool is not noisy,
but friendly and hard-working. The pool secretaries do not converse
excessively in the course of the working day.
12. The respondent admits that it had to make more use than usual of
temporary secretaries during August 2013 because of an outbreak of the
‘winter vomiting’ virus during the unusually cold, wet summer.
13. The respondent admits that there was a meeting on 25 August 2013
between Mr Sharpe and the claimant. The claimant seemed angry, but it is
denied that she was in tears at any point during this meeting. The claimant
said that she did not like working in the pool, and that she felt as if she had
been demoted. She said nothing about any alleged effect on her health, and
in particular she made no mention of depression. Mr Sharpe reiterated his
assurances that the claimant had not been demoted. It is denied that he said
that the claimant had shown herself to be a survivor in the past. He said that
he was confident that she would come to appreciate the benefits of working
in the pool in due course.
14. It is admitted that the claimant was signed off work by her GP for two
weeks from 24 October 2013. No other admission is made as to paragraph
11.
15. The respondent agrees that the claimant returned to work on 9 January
2014, and that the other secretaries welcomed her warmly. The secretaries’
room had been refurbished and rearranged in the claimant’s absence, and a
number of pot-plants had been purchased to brighten it up, but it is denied
that any special arrangements had been made for the claimant. It is denied

that the pool secretaries made a special effort to keep noise levels down for
the claimant’s sake, although it is true that one of the temporary secretaries
who had covered for the claimant’s sick leave had had to be spoken to in
early December about her tendency to distract the other secretaries.
16. No admission is made about the claimant’s stress levels or her sleeping
patterns. It is admitted that she occasionally stayed a short while beyond her
contractual finishing time, but it is denied that the claimant was working
excessive hours during this period.
17. Paragraph 11 is not admitted. Mr Sharpe has no recollection of
receiving any such letter. There were some difficulties with delivery of the
respondent’s post around this time.
18. The first two sentences of paragraph 12 are admitted. On 2 March 2014,
the claimant stormed into Mr Sharpe’s office saying ‘How dare you put me
on a reception rota?’ and proceeded to berate him for having demoted her.
The claimant appeared angry and upset, but it is denied that she was tearful.
Mr Sharpe was shocked by the claimant’s reaction to the rota, and sent her
home to calm down. He consulted the respondent’s external HR advisers
(Isthmus Consulting) about whether he should discipline the claimant for
her outburst, but decided that he would postpone that decision until he had
had the opportunity to speak to her again.
19. The respondent admits paragraphs 13 and 14.
20. The respondent denies that it was in fundamental or any breach of the
claimant’s contract of employment, as alleged at paragraph 15 or at all. In
particular, it is denied:
a) that the respondent refused to consider the claimant’s suggestion that
she should work for Miss Grey; the claimant’s suggestion was
considered, but rejected as impracticable;
b) that the respondent was aware of any reasons why the claimant was
likely to find the secretarial pool a difficult working environment;
c) that the respondent had any reason to believe that putting the claimant
on the reception rota was likely to cause her distress or injure her health.

21. The respondent admits that, not having received the letter of 16
February 2014 from the claimant’s GP, Mr Sharpe did not reply to it.
22. Except that the respondent admits the claimant resigned by her letter of
11 May 2014, the respondent denies paragraph 16.
23. The respondent denies that it dismissed the claimant; alternatively the
respondent denies that any dismissal was unfair.
24. The respondent denies that any of the matters complained of at
paragraph 18 placed the claimant at a substantial disadvantage compared to
persons who were not disabled. If, which is denied, any of the matters
complained of at paragraph 18 did place the claimant at a substantial
disadvantage compared to persons who were not disabled, the respondent
denies that it was or ought to have been aware of that fact.
25. In the circumstances, the respondent denies that it was under any duty to
prevent any of these matters from placing the claimant at a disadvantage.

Rahman
IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No 123456/14
LONDON CENTRAL
BETWEEN
SAIFUR RAHMAN
Claimant
and
ST JULIAN’S HOSPITAL NHS TRUST
Respondent
GROUNDS OF RESISTANCE

1. The respondent admits paragraphs 1 to 3 of the claimant’s particulars of
claim.
2. Paragraph 4 is denied.
3. Paragraphs 4 and 5 are denied.
4. It is admitted that the claimant wrote a letter dated 2 April 2014 to the
Chief Executive of the Hospital, Angela Grant, making an allegation that he
had witnessed the administration a sedative to a patient without a
prescription. The respondent denies that the claimant’s letter was a
protected act within the meaning of section 43A of the Employment Rights
Act 1996.
5. Paragraph 7 is admitted.
6. Paragraph 8 is denied. Sister Winston was on a day’s leave on 16 April
2014.
7. Paragraph 9 is admitted.
8. It is admitted that the Chairman of the panel, James Eastleigh, told the
claimant that the investigation of his allegation about the administration of a
sedative was complete. It is admitted that Elaine Watson commented that it
would not have been appropriate to take a statement from a vulnerable and
confused elderly patient. Except as above, paragraph 10 is denied. The
panel listened carefully to what the claimant had to say in his defence, and
did not reach its conclusion until its deliberations immediately following
the disciplinary hearing.
9. Paragraph 11 is admitted.
10. The respondent agrees that the claimant was dismissed at the conclusion
of the disciplinary hearing. The panel had read consistent statements from
three nurses working on Coventry Ward on 16 April 2014 to the effect that
the claimant had sworn at Sister Winston and frightened a vulnerable
elderly patient by moving her roughly in a display of temper.
11. The respondent makes no admission as to why the claimant did not
appeal his dismissal. The respondent denies that Mr Eastleigh said anything
about the circumstances in which an appeal could or could not succeed.

12. The respondent does not admit paragraphs 13 and 14.
13. The respondent agrees that the claimant’s claim is presented late, but
denies that it was ‘not reasonably practicable’ for the claimant to present his
claim in time. Accordingly the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider it.
14. The respondent denies paragraph 16. The claimant’s letter of 2 April
2014 to Angela Chapman had no bearing on the panel’s decision to dismiss
him for gross misconduct.
15. Paragraph 17 is denied. The respondent investigated the allegation
against the claimant thoroughly. The disciplinary panel listened carefully to
what the claimant said about why he believed Sister Winston might have a
grudge against him, but decided on balance that it found the statements of
Sister Winston, and two other nurses (Jane Marks and Susan Frelon)
convincing. The claimant was told of his right of appeal, but chose not to
exercise it.

Amendment of the claim
2.87
Sometimes it becomes clear, after a claim has been started, that the ET1
does not adequately explain the basis of the claim, or that additional claims
need to be added. Under previous versions of the rules, the tribunal had an
express power to permit amendment of the claim or response. Oddly, that
express power has been deleted from the 2013 rules. It’s clear enough (if
you’re a lawyer) that the tribunal still has this power: see also paras 1.98–
1.100. There’s quite a lot of case-law on the question of whether and in
what circumstances the tribunal should permit a claim to be amended. The
detail of that is beyond the scope of this book, but some tactical points are
worth making here.
2.88
Broadly, the closer you get to the hearing, the harder it is to amend, and it
will be harder to get permission for substantial amendments than for minor
ones. If a claim has to be presented in a hurry because the time limit is
close, it is legitimate to draft the bare bones of the claim in order to present
it in time. But if you do this, you should draft an amendment fleshing out

the claim and forward it to the tribunal as soon as possible. If you do decide
to present a short ET1 in order to get your claim in in time, include a note
explaining that further details will follow shortly, and possibly suggesting
that the respondent should not be required to present its response until after
that step has been taken.
2.89
This tactic should only be used if there is genuine urgency. Where it is
used, the claim, however brief, must still make it clear what is the nature of
the complaint. A claim that gives no clue as to what is the nature of the
discrimination alleged is at risk of being rejected outright as invalid, and
will do nothing to preserve the claimant’s position. What it may do is give
you or your adviser a false sense that there is now no urgency for a properly
formulated claim.
2.90
If the claim really has to be presented in a great hurry, it may be very
short, but it should not lack content altogether. The following words at
section 5 of the claim form should be sufficient to start Mr Rahman’s claim.
I was dismissed on 27 April 2014. My employer said that it was because I
had committed an act of misconduct, but I believe it was because I had
previously told my employer that a senior nurse was wrongly sedating a
difficult patient.
I believe I was dismissed as a result of making a protected disclosure and
therefore my dismissal was automatically unfair.
2.91
This, on the other hand, is inadequate:
Unfair dismissal: full details to follow.

Late amendments
2.92

The main danger with a late application for amendment is that it will be
refused on the basis that there is insufficient time before the hearing for the
respondent to deal with the changes. The other danger is that it will be
granted, but that the case will be postponed or adjourned in order to allow
the respondent to deal with the changes.6
2.93
The tribunal has power under rule 76 of the procedure rules to order one
party to pay to the other side the costs incurred by reason of a postponement
or adjournment, so if your application to amend is likely, if granted, to
mean the hearing has to be postponed, think carefully about how good your
excuse is for making the application so late, how important it is to you to
get it, and whether it is worth the risk of a costs order.
2.94
An amendment to add a completely new claim is likely to run into time
limit difficulties and may well require a postponement of the hearing in
order to permit the respondent to deal with the new allegations. Be realistic
about this: the best chance of heading off a costs application in these
circumstances will lie in a co-operative approach.
2.95
An application to amend that changes the way you put your case without
starting a fresh complaint should address, if possible, both the reasons why
the amendment could not have been made sooner, and the impact it will
have on the respondent’s preparation.

the basis of the claim
Request for permission to amend the claim
The Regional Secretary
London Central Employment Tribunal
Victory House
London WC2B 6EX
7 October 2014
Dear Madam
I should be grateful if you would put before a judge my request for
permission to amend this claim by inserting at the end of the narrative at
box 5.2 the following:
The dismissal was also wrongful. Mr Rahman was dismissed without
notice, in breach of his contract of employment.
This claim was not included in the original ET1, because of the time
pressure under which it was prepared. Mr Rahman attended North London
Law Centre on 3 August 2014, after the deadline for submitting his ET1
had passed. This was realised during the interview and an ET1 lodged with
the tribunal the same day. Unfortunately, the contract claim was overlooked.
All the facts relied on in respect of the wrongful dismissal claim were
included in the original ET1. The effect of the amendment sought is merely
to add a new label to facts already pleaded.7

The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the issues between the parties.
The prejudice to the claimant from a refusal of the application and
depriving him of part of his claim would be greater than any prejudice to
the respondent flowing from permitting the amendment.
This letter is copied to the respondent, who should write to the tribunal as
soon as possible if it wishes to oppose this application.
Yours faithfully,
Natalie Cummings

Notes
1 SI No 1893, available at www.legislation.gov.uk.
2 The case number is assigned by the tribunal after the claim is received, so the number cannot be
given here because it is not known yet.
3 This is included because it is important to establish that the respondent was aware of the claimant’s
disability.
4 This advice was wrong, of course. He had to present his claim by 26 July 2014 at the latest.
5 They are right.
6 A hearing is usually said to have been ‘postponed’ if it has been put off to a later date before it
started; if the parties attend on the hearing date and it is then decided either before the hearing starts
or part-way through it that it needs to be put off to another day, it is said to have been ‘adjourned’. If
a hearing is cancelled altogether it is sometimes said to have been ‘vacated’.
7 This a reference to part of the guidance on amendments – which will be familiar to the tribunal –
contained in Selkent Bus Company v Moore [1996] ICR 836.

What happens next
3.1
Once the tribunal has received the ET1 and ET3, they will make a case
management order and list a hearing. If the claim is a relatively simple one,

they may do this immediately after the ET1 is received.
3.2
The standard case management order essentially sets out the following
process:
1) The parties disclose relevant documents to each other and agree a
bundle.
2) The parties exchange witness statements containing their evidence
to the tribunal.
3) The parties attend a hearing to decide the case.
3.3
These steps are dealt with in more detail in the following chapters.

Different types of hearing
3.4
The procedure rules define two types of hearing: preliminary and final. A
case may involve a number of preliminary hearings and (oddly) a number
of final hearings.
3.5
Technically, preliminary hearings are to deal with case management
orders and decide preliminary issues. Final hearings deal with everything
else – most importantly deciding the outcome of the case. Preliminary
hearings (unless they are going to resolve a preliminary issue) take place in
private in front of a single judge. Final hearings (and preliminary hearings
which decide a preliminary issue) are public. They will be heard by a full
tribunal (although in many cases a full tribunal is a single judge).
3.6
As you might guess from that rather convoluted explanation, the two
terms used in the rules aren’t a very good fit with what actually happens in
cases. So don’t worry about them. Focus instead on what the tribunal is
trying to achieve with any given hearing.
3.7
The tribunal’s fundamental aim is to resolve cases. The way they do this
is to hear evidence, listen to what the parties say about the evidence and

then make a decision. If the claim succeeds, part of this decision will be
setting out the remedy the tribunal awards.
3.8
The length of that hearing varies. A simple wages claim might only take
one hour. Most unfair dismissal claims last one or two days. Complex and
difficult cases may last weeks.
3.9
Simple cases only involve this one final hearing. But as cases become
more complicated, they are harder to resolve in a single hearing, or it
becomes inefficient to do so. Then the tribunal uses other types of hearing
to manage the case. This is really no different to managing any other sort of
project. Something simple can be dealt with by everyone turning up and
getting on with the job; more complicated projects require more preparation
or are split for convenience into smaller chunks.
3.10
Just remember that the tribunal is always working towards the allimportant final hearing where it will resolve the case. Most other types of
hearing are tools to help the tribunal reach that point.
3.11
In what we follows, we ignore the awkward division of hearings into
‘final’ and ‘preliminary’. Instead, we discuss the following types of hearing,
divided by what they’re for:
case management discussions (CMD);
preliminary issue hearings;
remedy hearings;
other hearings.
3.12
‘Case management discussion’ was a term recognised in the old procedure
rules, and we suspect that it will continue to be used. That’s because the
expression accurately describes something that will continue to happen:
hearings at which the parties and judge discuss the management of the case.
3.13
Whether or not the expression continues in use, the thing will continue to
happen. It will be called a ‘preliminary hearing’. What we’re describing as

preliminary issue hearings are the other sort of preliminary hearing. And
remedy hearings are a particular kind of ‘final’ hearing. Generally, the
tribunal will decide what sorts of hearing are appropriate, although it’s also
open to the parties to ask them to list a particular kind of hearing. No doubt
– obedient to the 2013 rules – they will call them either ‘preliminary’ or
‘final,’ but any time the tribunal notifies you of a hearing of any sort, they
should also tell you what they plan to do at it. So don’t get hung up on the
name – just pay attention to what the hearing is for.

Case management discussions
3.14
A case management discussion is a hearing to make decisions about how
the case will be dealt with and to make case management orders.
3.15
In many cases you don’t need a hearing to do this. The tribunal can issue
standard case management orders when the claim is lodged. If either side
wants additional orders, this can be dealt with in writing.
3.16
But in a complicated case, a hearing devoted to case management issues
can be useful. They can resolve issues such as:
whether or not a party should be permitted to amend the claim or the
response;
whether a hearing date should be postponed;
whether orders should be made for disclosure of specific documents or
written answers to questions;
when witness statements should be exchanged;
who should be responsible for preparing the bundle and when this
should be done;
whether expert evidence is to be permitted;
what are the issues for the main hearing;
whether any of the issues should be separated out to be dealt with at a
pre-hearing review (PH);
how many hearing days will be needed;
on what date or dates the case should be heard.

3.17
Often there is little or nothing that is seriously contentious at a CMD, and it
is not at all uncommon for the parties to agree the issues and suitable
directions before the hearing starts and propose them, jointly, to the judge.
3.18
When push comes to shove, however (and it quite often does), the judge
is in control and can impose her view. Although often uncontentious and
co-operative, a CMD can also be the forum for a serious dispute between
the parties with far-reaching consequences for the final outcome of the case.
It is important to be aware of which issues are likely to be fought over, and
to be ready with arguments on any that are. Matters of timing, for example,
or who is to be responsible for the preparation of hearing bundles, can
usually be agreed without much difficulty. Disputes about whether a
particular document or class of documents should be disclosed by the
respondent may be hotly contested. Any significant amendment to the claim
or response may be opposed by the other party. An application for costs
may be made at a CMD, and this too will almost always be strongly
contested.
3.19
In addition to making case management orders, the tribunal at a CMD
will probably want to identify the issues that will be decided at the
substantive hearing.
3.20
Having the tribunal formalise the issues in the case at an early stage is
often helpful. But it is important to make sure that all the relevant issues
have been identified and recorded. It is sensible to prepare a draft list of
issues before any CMD.

What to take to a CMD
3.21
The things you will normally want to take with you to a CMD are:
your file for the case, including the ET1 and ET3 and all your
correspondence;
a proposed list of issues;

a set of draft directions;
a list of the witnesses you want to call, together with their unavailable
dates for the next 6 months or so;
your diary (or a list of your unavailable dates for the next six months
or so).
3.22
In a more complicated case you may also want:
an agenda;
written submissions.
3.23
Written submissions will only rarely be required at this stage. You might
want to prepare one if there is a serious dispute about whether or not a
particular document in the possession of one party or the other is privileged
(see paras 4.52–4.62), for example, or whether proceedings should be
stayed pending the outcome of a related appeal or other proceedings.

CMD agenda
1)
2)
3)
4)

Clarification of issues for the main hearing.
Claimant’s application to amend the claim.
Respondent’s application to amend its response.
Claimant’s application for an order for disclosure of all
communications between personnel and management relating to the
disciplinary proceedings.
5) Witness statements.
6) Hearing bundle.
7) Listing.

Example: List of issues and suggested directions for CMD
1) Was it reasonably practicable for Saifur Rahman (SR) to present his
complaint by 26 July 2014?
2) If not, did he present it within such further time as was reasonable in
all the circumstances?

Unfair dismissal
3) Did SR make a protected disclosure in informing the Chief
Executive of the Trust of his concerns about what Sister Winston
had said on 26 March 2014?
4) If so, was the fact that he had made a protected disclosure the reason
or a significant part of the reason for SR’s dismissal?
5) If not, what was the reason for SR’s dismissal?
6) Was that an admissible reason for dismissal?
7) If so, was the dismissal (a) substantively fair; (b) procedurally fair?
8) If SR’s dismissal was unfair, what loss has he suffered because of
his dismissal?
Wrongful dismissal
9) Was SR guilty of gross misconduct?
Suggested directions
10) Updated schedule of loss to be provided by claimant on or before
11 July 2015.
11) Hearing to be listed for three days.
12) Witness statements to be exchanged 28 days before the hearing.
13) Index to hearing bundle to be agreed between the parties 14 days
before the hearing.
14) Bundle to be compiled and copied by the claimant, and one copy
to be provided to the respondent seven days before the hearing.

Preliminary issue hearings
3.24
In general, tribunals don’t split cases up into individual issues. If you bring
an unlawful deduction of wages claim, the tribunal will hold a hearing to
decide how many hours you worked, how much you should have been paid
for each hour, whether there have been any deductions and whether they
were lawful. It doesn’t hold one hearing to decide how many hours you
worked; then one to decide how much you should have been paid and so on.
3.25
Sometimes, however, the tribunal will want (or a party will want) to split
off an issue from the rest of the case. This is most common where there is a

single issue that, if it is decided one way, will dispose of the case and which
is conveniently separate from the other issues.
3.26
For example, in a disability discrimination case, the parties will often
disagree about whether the employee was disabled. If she wasn’t, the rest of
the issues in the disability claim normally don’t arise – most disability
discrimination claims rely on the claimant being disabled. And the evidence
of disability – which focuses on the employee’s physical or mental
condition – is generally separate from the evidence of how she was treated
by her employer.
3.27
The main reason for hearings on preliminary issues is practical. It is often
more efficient to deal with preliminary matters separately. It simplifies
hearings by reducing the number of issues each has to deal with. More
importantly, it can dispose of cases without the need for long hearings if
they do not survive the PH. This should not be seen as an entirely bad thing.
If you are going to lose your case, it may be preferable to lose it early in the
process, after a short hearing, than later, after a long and exhausting battle.
3.28
Saifur Rahman’s case provides an example. Saifur got bad advice from
the Care Workers’ Advice Project about the time limit for his claim, and
presented it late. This gives rise to a preliminary issue: was it reasonably
practicable for him to present his claim in time? If not, his claim will go no
further. His substantive case will probably take 3 or 4 days to hear, and
require the attendance of several witnesses from the hospital. The
preliminary question will take a day at most, and the only witness likely to
be needed is Mr Rahman himself. It’s more sensible for the tribunal to
decide that question first at a PH.
3.29
The widespread use of hearings to consider preliminary issues also
affects settlement negotiations. If there is a chance that a potentially
expensive case can be knocked out, respondents are reluctant to settle until
after the preliminary hearing. The flip side is that victory in a preliminary
hearing can give you momentum, and encourage the respondent to make a
higher offer.
3.30

Issues that may be considered at a preliminary hearing include:
Was your claim brought in time?
Were you an employee?
Were you disabled?
Did you comply with early conciliation?
3.31
Preliminary hearings of this sort work exactly like full substantive hearings.
Evidence is given and submissions made in the same way. The only
difference is in the issues that the tribunal is intending to decide. This
means that, in a preliminary hearing, only evidence and submissions
relevant to the preliminary point should be given. The issues that will be
dealt with at the preliminary hearing should be set out in the order listing
the hearing.

Remedies hearing
3.32
Sometimes the tribunal will list a hearing for liability only. This means that
the initial hearing will only decide whether the claim succeeds, not what
compensation will be awarded. Then another hearing will take place to
determine remedy.
3.33
Never assume that remedy will be dealt with separately, unless this has
been clearly ordered by the tribunal (normally this will be apparent on the
notice of hearing). If you get to the start of the hearing and realise you don’t
know whether the tribunal is planning to deal with liability and remedy
together, or liability first, ask for clarification at the start.

Other hearings
3.34
The tribunal may have hearings, either before or after the substantive
hearing, to deal with other issues or applications. For example, if a party
applies for costs after the tribunal’s judgment it may be necessary to have a

costs hearing. Similarly, if either side applies for a review, there may be a
review hearing.
3.35
Whether or not these types of issues require a hearing will depend on
their difficulty, importance and complexity. Straightforward or unimportant
issues will probably be decided on paper, with the tribunal considering
parties written submissions. More complicated or important matters are
more likely to lead to a hearing.

Listing hearings
3.36
Once the tribunal has decided to hold a hearing, they will need to ‘list the
hearing’ – lawyer jargon for setting a date.
3.37
Each tribunal venue maintains a diary, which includes information on
when a tribunal will be available and what hearings have been listed so far.
When a new hearing has to be listed, the tribunal will normally slot it into
the next available space.
3.38
This is subject to the availability of the parties, their witnesses and
representatives. Within reason, the tribunal will avoid listing a hearing for a
date when anyone relevant is unavailable.
3.39
It is much easier to avoid having a hearing listed on a particular date than
to postpone a hearing once it has been listed. So at any hearing where a
further hearing may be listed, it’s important to have access to your diary so
that you can tell the tribunal when you’re unavailable. You may also need
lists for unavailable dates for any witnesses you want to call.

Date and duration of the hearing
3.40
Estimating the length of hearing is an inexact process even for experienced
practitioners. Much depends on how witnesses answer questions, and how
the judge runs the hearing. But the following factors are relevant:

The subject-matter of the case. If it is about a single event – a
dismissal for gross misconduct, for example, or a failure to promote or
appoint – then it will be shorter than a complaint that a course of
conduct over a long period was discriminatory, or that a whole series
of different acts added up to a fundamental breach of contract.
The amount of relevant documentation. If there is a great volume of
paper that the tribunal will need to read, and that the witnesses will
need to answer questions on, then the hearing will take longer than if
the bundle is only 30 or 40 pages long.
The number of witnesses. This is relevant, but it is less important than
it may seem at first sight. The factor that makes most of the difference
is how long and complicated a story the witnesses have to tell, not how
many of them there are.
The length of witness statements. Length of witness statements is some
guide to how long the witness’s evidence will take, but only an
approximate one. One crucial witness may give a very short statement
that just leaves out all the material you will want to cross-examine her
about, so the fact that her statement is short may mean that your crossexamination has to be long. On the other hand, another witness may
have nothing much of relevance to say at all, but say it at great length.
If you don’t think a witness’s evidence is relevant to what the tribunal
has to decide, you don’t have to cross-examine her about it – even if
you disagree with it. So this witness’s evidence may be completed in a
very short time, despite the length of her statement.
Whether any of the evidence will have to be taken through an
interpreter. If so, the time estimate for that witness’s evidence needs to
be doubled at least.
3.41
A straightforward wages or contract claim should be finished in a single
day. A straightforward unfair dismissal claim where the reason given is
redundancy or gross misconduct will rarely take more than two days.
Discrimination claims tend to take longer, although they can sometimes be
finished in a day if the facts are simple and the complaint doesn’t involve
telling a long story.
3.42

For more substantial claims, an approximate picture can be built up by
considering each witness in turn. Witnesses used to be asked to asked to
read their statements aloud before cross-examination begins, but this is now
the exception rather than the rule. If witness statements are to be read aloud,
a reading speed of about 160 words per minute is probably a fair rule of
thumb, plus pauses for everyone to read documents referred to. More likely,
the tribunal will start by reading the witness statements and the main
documents for themselves. The main part of oral evidence will be crossexamination, followed by questions from the tribunal (normally but not
necessarily brief) and then re-examination (likewise).
Example
The statement for Mr Rahman of P4.45.1 is 2,000 words long. He mentions
a number of documents in his statement, each of which the tribunal will
probably want to read. Most of them are short: say 30 seconds each for the
six letters, and a minute each for the three nurses’ statements. The tribunal
can probably read this material in 15–20 minutes.
Then there will be cross-examination of Mr Rahman. The respondent will
probably want 1–1½ hours to cross-examine him on a statement of this
length, referring to this number of documents. The more relevant
documents there are, and the more detailed they are, the longer the time that
will have to be allotted to cross-examination.
3.43
If something changes that affects the likely length of the hearing after the
date has been set, tell the tribunal about it as soon as possible so that the
hearing can be adjusted.
3.44
In simpler cases where the tribunal doesn’t hold a CMD, it may invite
you to give your unavailable dates before listing the case. If so, take care to
provide unavailable dates for everyone who will need to be there on your
side. If you give unavailable dates in advance, then provided they are not
too extensive they will rarely, if ever, be questioned by the tribunal.

Representatives sometimes doubt whether it is permissible to take their own
convenience into account, so it’s worth spelling out here that it is: many
Free Representation Unit (FRU) volunteers, for example, are still students,
and should not feel shy to give as ‘unavailable’ dates on which they have
exams to sit, or (within reason) imminent exams or assessments to prepare
for.
3.45
This is also the moment to tell the tribunal if you think its time estimate
is wrong. This is important because cases are listed for a set number of
days, and if the case is not completed in the allotted time the tribunal won’t
be able to continue on consecutive days: it will be necessary to find another
date, often several months ahead, when all three members of the tribunal,
the parties, their representatives and any remaining witnesses can be
present. This is undesirable from everyone’s point of view: the tribunal’s
recollection of the evidence will fade, and depending on the order in which
the evidence is given the tribunal may be left with strong and immediate
recollections of the respondent’s evidence as against distant and incomplete
memories of yours.

Postponement requests
3.46
Once the case is listed, the tribunal is likely to be less accepting of reasons
given for unavailability than it would have been if they had been drawn to
its attention in advance. If the parties have not been invited to give their
unavailable dates, then a prompt request for a postponement on the grounds
that the claimant, a witness or the representative is unavailable will
probably be granted, at least for the first time. The more previous
postponements there have been, and the closer to the hearing a
postponement request comes, the harder the tribunal is likely to look at the
reasons before granting it. If it is essential to request a postponement close
to the hearing, or after the case has been previously postponed, the request
should deal carefully with the reasons why the need could not have been
foreseen earlier, and why it is essential that that witness – or that particular
adviser – should be able to be present.
3.47

Where the problem is with the representative’s availability, a claimant
relying on free advice has a slight advantage. Tribunals will be reluctant to
postpone a case because of the unforeseen unavailability of the respondent’s
counsel or solicitor: they will take the view that there are plenty of
barristers and solicitors in the world and the respondent can choose another.
The same cannot be said of free representation: demand greatly outstrips
supply, and a claimant whose law centre adviser or FRU representative, for
example, is unavailable on the day of the hearing is unlikely to have any
other options. This was recognised by the EAT in Yearwood v Royal Mail
(see appendix A).
3.48
If you want to apply for postponement and the other side objects, or
you’re applying at short notice, you should be ready to provide evidence of
the need for it – including medical evidence if the reason for the request is
illness. A medical certificate simply signing you off work at the time of the
hearing is unlikely to be sufficient, so ask your GP (or other medical
adviser) to deal specifically with whether you are well enough to attend a
hearing; and, if not, when you are likely to be sufficiently recovered – see
Andreou v Lord Chancellor’s Department.1

VERY URGENT PLEASE: HEARING STARTING TOMORROW
Dear Madam

Pauline Phelps v Gentleman, Sharpe & Co
I am afraid it is necessary for me to make an urgent application for a
postponement of this hearing, starting tomorrow and listed for four days.
I have just heard that Natalie Cummings, who has conduct of this case for
Ms Phelps and was intending to represent her at the hearing, has been taken
into hospital today with suspected appendicitis. Ms Cummings was off
work yesterday, but had put her symptoms down to a ‘tummy bug’ and
expected to be able to return to work today. I understand that if the
diagnosis is confirmed, she is likely to undergo an operation today or
tomorrow.
The claim raises complex questions under the Equality Act 2010, and there
is a substantial volume of documentation. Ms Cummings is one of only two
employment lawyers employed by the Law Centre; the other, Mr Rhodes, is
in another tribunal this week. The papers are currently with Ms Cummings
as she took them home to work on last weekend. Ms Phelps herself has not
made any preparations to represent herself, and the nature of her disability
is such that she could not in any event contemplate doing so.
For these reasons I suggest that it is in the interests of the efficient and fair
disposal of the case that the hearing should be postponed.
This letter is copied to the respondent. The respondent should note that if it
objects to the application, it must write to the tribunal today explaining the
reasons for its objection, and should copy that letter to me.
Yours faithfully
Jennifer Selscombe
3.49
For an application as urgent as this, it is a sensible precaution to telephone
the tribunal 10 or 15 minutes after sending the e-mail to ask the clerk to
make sure that it goes before a chairman at the earliest opportunity.

Introduction
4.1
Most people think of the hearing as the decisive point in litigation. How
you conduct the hearing is important, but many cases – perhaps most – are
won or lost primarily on the documentary evidence.
4.2
Most of the relevant documents will be in the hands of your former
employer, so one of your most important tasks is to get the documents you
need out of them. The tribunal will often make a standard order requiring
both sides to disclose to each other all the relevant documents in their
possession, but it’s never safe to assume that it will be fully complied with.
Always consider whether, once you have seen the material the other side

has disclosed in response to that order, you should make further specific
requests. If there’s going to be a single crucial document that wins the case
for you, as likely as not it’ll be one the respondent had to be ordered by the
tribunal to disclose.
4.3
Documents are the normally the most important kind of information you
will need to get out of the other side, but it’s convenient to deal with the
other available methods of extracting information at the same time.
4.4
There are essentially six methods. The first three come from the
tribunal’s case management powers:
1) a request for disclosure of documents;
2) a request for clarification of the respondent’s ET3;
3) a free-standing request for information, not necessarily arising
directly out of the respondent’s ET3.
4.5
The other three are:
1) a questionnaire: a mechanism only available in discrimination cases,
although having much in common with requests for written answers;
2) a subject access request under the Data Protection Act 1998;
3) where the employer is a public authority, a request under the
Freedom of Information Act 2000.
4.6
In this chapter we start by considering – without worrying for the moment
which technique is the applicable one – the timing of requests, and what
information to seek. That leads to discussions of relevance; how to decide
what to ask at this stage and what to save for cross-examination; and
privilege. The next section explains how each individual method works.
Finally, we consider your own duty of disclosure, and how to respond to
specific requests from the respondent.

When to consider requests for information
4.7

Don’t think of extracting information from the other side as a job you can
forget after you’ve done it once, fairly early in proceedings. Information
can be requested at any time, and sometimes you won’t know what’s
missing until you have thought quite hard about other bits of information
that you already have. Putting together your case can be a bit like doing a
jigsaw puzzle. In particular, consider making a request:

When you receive the response to the claim
4.8
This is the obvious moment for requests for information. If some part of the
ET3 is vague or unclear, it makes sense to seek clarification straight away.
The ET3 will probably also mention documents, or events that must have
given rise to documents (eg meetings that must have been minuted) that
haven’t yet been disclosed. This is worth noticing for future reference, but it
is too soon at this stage to fire off a request for disclosure of specific
documents. In due course the tribunal will give directions for both sides to
disclose to each other all the relevant documents in their possession.

When you receive the documents the respondent discloses
voluntarily
4.9
At this point, you need to take a careful and critical look at what the
respondent has disclosed. Start by putting the documents you’ve received in
chronological order, if that’s not how they have been sent to you. Go
through them in detail to check that each individual document is complete.
Make a note of any reference in one document to any other document that
looks relevant, and then check that the document referred to has also been
disclosed. Highlight any reference to an event that sounds as if it is likely to
have given rise to relevant documents, too. For example, if a meeting is
mentioned, are there any minutes of it? If there’s mention of a written
warning, has it been included? If there are disciplinary or attendance
proceedings, where’s the disciplinary or attendance management policy?

When witness statements are exchanged
4.10

Sometimes it becomes clear from the respondent’s witness statements that
there are further relevant documents that still haven’t been disclosed. If so,
it shouldn’t be too late to make an urgent request for further specific
disclosure, although it will probably be necessary to explain to the tribunal
why the application for an order is so late. That won’t be difficult if the
document is one you didn’t know existed until it was mentioned (or its
existence implied) in one of the respondent’s witness statements. Note that
this is a good reason for starting to prepare your cross-examination of the
respondent’s witnesses as soon as you get their statements: it’s often the
process of deciding what questions you want to ask them that makes you
realise that there are gaps in the documentary record.

During the hearing
4.11
In most cases, once the hearing has started it is too late to ask for further
disclosure or information. In any event, cross-examination is likely to have
taken over.
4.12
The exception is where a witness refers to an important document that
plainly ought to have been disclosed. In that case, if you think disclosure is
likely to help you, it’s reasonable to ask the tribunal to order the other side
to disclose it forthwith – perhaps by e-mailing or faxing it direct to the
tribunal. Even if you’re sure the witness is lying and there is no such
document, it may still be useful to ask for an order: if they can’t produce it,
that may damage their credibility. If the witness keeps referring to
documents that haven’t been disclosed, keep a close eye on the tribunal’s
reactions, and bear in mind that the witness is being pretty annoying. You
want the tribunal to stay annoyed with the witness, and not transfer their
annoyance to you – so don’t keep applying for more disclosure orders
unless there’s a good reason to, or the tribunal seems to want you to.

Deciding what to ask for
4.13
Requests for documents and information should be kept to what is relevant
to something in dispute between the parties. Long requests of questionable

relevance will probably be refused by the respondent, and the tribunal is
unlikely to grant an order. The temptation to try to cross-examine by letter
should be resisted. So should the temptation to seek an unrealistic level of
detail. Requests drafted by solicitors tend to be sprinkled with expressions
like ‘with full particularity’, ‘giving the precise time of each meeting’,
‘giving the exact words used’ and so on. But more often than not this is
futile: it’s rare that a witness will remember the exact words of an oral
exchange or the precise time of anything; rarer still that it will matter.
4.14
The best starting point for a request for information or disclosure of
documents is the response. Go through the ET3 line by line, checking for
ambiguous or incomplete statements and documents that may or must exist.
Don’t be too fussy at this stage: never mind whether the questions that
occur to you are questions you should ask now, questions to save for crossexamination, questions your client will be able to answer, or requests for
documents. Just write down all the questions you think of. You can sort
them into their different categories later.
4.15
If you’re an adviser, your client will be an excellent source of
information about the kind of question to ask, and the kinds of documents
the employer may have. The trick is to harness your own knowledge of how
to get information out of an employer with your client’s knowledge of this
particular employer’s working practices. One technique is simply to
remember to ask questions like ‘How can we prove that?’ and ‘What
records do they keep?’ at intervals while taking the statement. Another is to
give your client a first draft of the request for discovery, etc, ask her if she
knows any of the answers or already has copies of any of the documents
herself, and ask her for suggestions as to what else it might be useful to ask
for.
4.16
The next precedent is the employer’s response to Pauline Phelps’ claim,
annotated to show the questions it suggests.
4.17
If you want to try the exercise for yourself before reading this, there is a
copy of the same document without annotations at precedent P2.86.1.

PRECEDENT 4.17.1: Employer’s response to claim
IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No 123456/14
BRISTOL
BETWEEN
PAULINE PHELPS
Claimant
and
SHARPE, GENTLEMAN & CO SOLICITORS
Respondent
GROUNDS OF RESISTANCE
1. The respondent is a High Street firm of solicitors, founded in 1922. It
currently has five partners and employs 12 non-partner fee-earners.
2. The respondent admits that the claimant has at all material times had a
facial disfigurement. The respondent does not admit that the claimant
suffers from depression or agoraphobia, or that she is disabled within the
meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010. The respondent was not
aware, and had no reason to believe, that the claimant considered herself
disabled until it received her grievance dated 8 May 2014.
3. Paragraph 2 of the claim is admitted, save that the ‘trust and confidence’
term was that the respondent would not without reasonable and proper
cause conduct itself in a manner likely to destroy the relationship of trust
and confidence between employer and employee.
4. The respondent admits the first sentence of paragraph 3. It is denied that
the claimant’s disfigurement was discussed at the interview, or that Mr
Gentleman gave the claimant any assurances about the circumstances in
which she would work.
How do they know, more than 20 years later? Do any interview notes survive?

It is denied that the claimant said anything about depression on any form
that she filled in for the respondent.
Do they still have the forms she filled in?

5. The respondent admits that the claimant worked as Mr Gentleman’s
secretary until his retirement in July 2014, and that her work was generally
satisfactory.
Were there any formal appraisals?

The respondent makes no admission as to how happy she was in her work.
It is admitted that the claimant sat in an inner office adjoining Mr
Gentleman’s room on the 3rd floor of the building, but her assertion that she
never encountered clients there is denied. Mr Gentleman often saw clients
in his room when the respondent’s meeting rooms were all engaged, and on
those occasions the claimant would provide tea and coffee.
How many meeting rooms do they have? How were appointments and meeting
rooms booked?

6. The respondent admits that its records do not show that the claimant took
any sick leave while she worked for Mr Gentleman.
What records?

No admission is made as to any episodes of depression suffered by the
claimant during this time.
7. Paragraph 5 is admitted.
8. It is admitted that Mr Sharpe, the respondent’s managing partner, directed
the claimant to join the pool of secretaries on Mr Gentleman’s retirement.
How did he direct her? Is there a memo or an e-mail, or did he speak to her?

The claimant’s description of the office layout is agreed.
9. It is denied that the claimant told Mr Sharpe that she would find it
difficult and stressful working in the room used by the pool secretaries. The
claimant objected to Mr Sharpe’s proposal because she saw it as a
demotion. Mr Sharpe assured her that it was not a demotion, and her
seniority and status were unaffected. The claimant did suggest that she
should work full-time for Miss Grey, but this was impracticable because

Miss Grey types most of her own correspondence and does not require a
full-time secretary.
How much use does Miss Grey make of the pool secretaries? What, other than
typing, did Pauline Phelps do for Mr Sharpe? How are these tasks covered for Miss
Grey and the assistant solicitors?

In any event, the respondent took a policy decision in 2011 gradually to
phase out the use of secretaries assigned to individual solicitors in favour of
more flexible use of the pool secretaries.
Who took this decision? When? Is there any documentary record?

10. The first sentence of paragraph 7 is admitted. The respondent does not
make any admission as to the second sentence.
11. It is denied that all the other secretaries in the pool were in their
twenties. Including the claimant, there were seven members of the pool, and
three of those were in their thirties.
What are their ages?

The atmosphere in the pool is not noisy, but friendly and hard-working. The
pool secretaries do not converse excessively in the course of the working
day.
12. The respondent admits that it had to make more use than usual of
temporary secretaries during August 2012 because of an outbreak of the
‘winter vomiting’ virus during the unusually cold, wet summer.
Does it keep records of its use of temps?

13. The respondent admits that there was a meeting on 25 August 2012
between Mr Sharpe and the claimant. The claimant seemed angry, but it is
denied that she was in tears at any point during this meeting. The claimant
said that she did not like working in the pool, and that she felt as if she had
been demoted. She said nothing about any alleged effect on her health, and
in particular she made no mention of depression. Mr Sharpe reiterated his
assurances that the claimant had not been demoted. It is denied that he said
that the claimant had shown herself to be a survivor in the past. He said that
we were confident that she would come to appreciate the benefits of
working in the pool in due course.

14. It is admitted that the claimant was signed off work by her GP for two
weeks from 24 October 2013. No other admission is made as to paragraph
11.
15. The respondent agrees that the claimant returned to work on 5 January
2014, and that the other secretaries welcomed her warmly. The secretaries’
room had been refurbished and rearranged in the claimant’s absence, and a
number of pot-plants had been purchased to brighten it up, but it is denied
that any special arrangements had been made for the claimant.
What prompted the refurbishment? Whose decision was it? Was anyone consulted?
What documentation is there of the decision to refurbish?

It is denied that the pool secretaries made a special effort to keep noise
levels down for the claimant’s sake, although it is true that one of the
temporary secretaries who had covered for the claimant’s sick leave had had
to be spoken to in early December about her tendency to distract the other
secretaries.
Is there any record of this conversation?

16. No admission is made about the claimant’s stress levels or her sleeping
patterns. It is admitted that she occasionally stayed a short while beyond her
contractual finishing time, but it is denied that the claimant was working
excessive hours during this period.
Does the respondent keep records of arrival and departure times?

17. Paragraph 11 is not admitted. Mr Sharpe has no recollection of
receiving any such letter. There were some difficulties with delivery of the
respondent’s post around this time.
What difficulties? Did they complain to the Royal Mail? What else went astray?

18. The first two sentences of paragraph 12 are admitted. On 2 March 2014,
the claimant stormed into Mr Sharpe’s office saying ‘How dare you put me
on a reception rota?’ and proceeded to berate him for having demoted her.
The claimant appeared angry and upset, but it is denied that she was tearful.
Mr Sharpe was shocked by the claimant’s reaction to the rota, and sent her
home to calm down. He consulted the respondent’s external HR advisers
(Isthmus Consulting) about whether he should discipline the claimant for

her outburst, but decided that he would postpone that decision until he had
had the opportunity to speak to her again.
What record does he have of the conversation with Isthmus? What record do they
have? Did they record the phone call?

19. The respondent admits paragraphs 13 and 14.
20. The respondent denies that it was in fundamental or any breach of the
claimant’s contract of employment as alleged at paragraph 15 or at all. In
particular, it is denied:
1. that the respondent refused to consider the claimant’s suggestion that
she should work for Miss Grey; the claimant’s suggestion was
considered, but rejected as impracticable;
When, how and by whom was it considered? Was Miss Grey consulted?

2. that the respondent was aware of any reasons why the claimant was
likely to find the secretarial pool a difficult working environment;
3. that the respondent had any reason to believe that putting the claimant
on the reception rota was likely to cause her distress or injure her health.
21. The respondent admits that, not having received the letter of 16
February 2014 from the Claimant’s GP, Mr Sharpe did not reply to it.
22. Except that the respondent admits the claimant resigned by her letter of
11 May 2014, the respondent denies paragraph 16.
23. The respondent denies that it dismissed the claimant; alternatively the
respondent denies that any dismissal was unfair.
24. The respondent denies that any of the matters complained at at
paragraph 18 placed the claimant at a substantial disadvantage compared to
persons who were not disabled. If, which is denied, any of the matters
complained of at paragraph 18 did place the claimant at a substantial
disadvantage compared to persons who were not disabled, the respondent
denies that it was or ought to have been aware of that fact.
25. In the circumstances, the respondent denies that it was under any duty to
prevent any of these matters from placing the claimant at a disadvantage.
P4.17.2

PRECEDENT 4.17.2: List of questions
This exercise yields the following:
1. How do Sharpe, Gentleman & Co know, more than 20 years later, what
Ms Phelps said in her interview? Do any interview notes survive?
2. Do they still have the forms she filled in?
3. Were there any formal appraisals while she was working for Mr
Gentleman?
4. How many meeting rooms do they have? How were appointments and
meeting rooms booked?
5. What attendance records have they got?
6. How did Mr Sharpe direct the claimant to join the secretarial pool? Is
there a memo or an e-mail, or did he speak to her?
7. How much use does Miss Grey make of the pool secretaries? What, other
than typing, did Pauline Phelps do for Mr Sharpe? How are these tasks
covered for Miss Grey and the assistant solicitors?
8. Who took the decision to phase out individual secretaries? When? Is
there any documentary record?
9. What are the ages of the pool secretaries?
10. Does the respondent keep records of its use of temps?
11. What prompted the refurbishment that took place while the claimant
was absent on sick leave? How extensive was it? Were contractors used?
Was new furniture bought?
12. Is there any record of the conversation with the disruptive temp?
13. Does the respondent keep records of arrival and departure times?
14. What difficulties did the respondent have with its post? Did they
complain to the Royal Mail? What else went astray?
15. What record does he have of the conversation with Isthmus? What
records do Isthmus have? Did they record the phone call?

16. When, how and by whom was Ms Phelps’ suggestion that she should
work for Miss Grey considered? Was Miss Grey consulted?
4.20
The next thing is to decide what to do with these questions. Some of them
will form the basis for requests for additional information or disclosure of
documents; others may be better saved for cross-examination.

Written requests and cross-examination
4.21
There are always decisions to be taken about whether to ask a question
before the hearing by way of a request for further particulars or written
answers, or to save it for cross-examination. The best way of approaching
this is to think about what the question is for, and how the answer will differ
depending on the circumstances in which it is asked. For example, the
questions above about how much post went astray and what the respondent
did about it, put in cross-examination, may elicit an answer like:
Oh, I couldn’t say exactly now, but I know several letters went astray
around that time. The office administrator phoned Royal Mail at least
three times, and finally made a written complaint.
4.22
This may be true, or it may not. Either way it will be difficult to challenge
effectively during the hearing. But if you ask in advance for details of what
went astray and copies of any written complaints, and they can’t find
anything, their assertion that this was a recurring problem at the time looks
rather thin.
4.23
On the other hand, if you are acting for Saifur Rahman and you ask in
advance of the hearing what the panel considered before they made their
decision to dismiss, the likely answer will be a textbook account, drafted by
their lawyer, of all the relevant and proper considerations that they should
have had in mind. By the time of the hearing, the witness in question may
have persuaded herself that she did indeed have all those things in mind.
The same question put to a witness for the first time in cross-examination

may produce a floundering (and therefore helpful) demonstration that she
did not have a clue what she ought to consider, and did not – for example –
give Saifur any credit for his unblemished service, or trouble to acquaint
herself with his performance and past appraisal records.
4.24
This, incidentally, is a rare example of the kind of situation in which an
‘open’ question can be useful in cross-examination.
4.25
As a rule of thumb, if the question is designed to get hard information
that you don’t know without asking, it’s probably best to make it the subject
of a request for additional information or written answers. If the aim is to
embarrass a witness or get them to make a useful admission, or give them
an opportunity to say something foolish, it’s best saved for crossexamination.

Using the tribunal’s case management
powers
4.26
The relevant powers of the tribunal are contained at rules 29 and 31 of the
procedure rules. Rule 29 is quite general:
The Tribunal may at any stage of the proceedings, on its own initiative or
on application, make a case management order. The particular powers
identified in the following rules do not restrict that general power. A case
management order may vary, suspend or set aside an earlier case
management order where that is necessary in the interests of justice, and
in particular where a party affected by the earlier order did not have a
reasonable opportunity to make representations before it was made.
4.27
Case management orders are orders about the conduct of the proceedings
that don’t actually determine the substance of the proceedings. So in
essence, rule 29 gives the tribunal a wide power – which it must exercise in
accordance with the overriding objective of dealing with cases fairly and
justly – to do give orders about how the proceedings are to be conducted.

4.28
Under previous versions of the rules, tribunals had specific powers to
make three kinds of orders to help parties get information out of each other.
These were:
orders for ‘additional information’ or ‘further particulars’: that is,
orders for clarification of the claim or response (further particulars was
the older term, but is still in common use);
orders for written answers: that is, orders that a party answer a
question put to them in writing; and
orders for disclosure of documents.
4.29
These powers still exist: see para 1.98 above. The power to order disclosure
of documents is by far the most important of these three powers. It’s almost
always necessary to make some requests for specific disclosure. The other
two can be useful, but there will be many cases in which they’re not
necessary. These two are dealt with briefly below before a more detailed
discussion of disclosure.

Requests for additional information
4.30
These are requests of the general form ‘When you said XYZ in your
response, what did you mean?’ There’s no need to assume that a request for
additional information is required unless there’s something about the
response that leaves you in genuine doubt about what the respondent’s case
is. Unnecessary requests will just waste time, and in an extreme case could
put you at risk of a costs order.
4.31
When requesting further detail of something that has been said in the
response, it’s conventional – and helpful – to quote the relevant part so that
the request can be read as a single self-contained document: that is, the
reader can see what each question is getting at without having to refer back
to the response.

Requests for written answers
4.32

Again, just because the tribunal has power to order the other party to
answer written questions, it doesn’t follow that you have to make a request.
4.33
The next precedent is a request for written answers in Pauline Phelps’
case. The questions are those that emerge from the list at para 4.17 above.
Note that a large proportion of them have been crossed out, either because
they are better saved for cross-examination, or because Miss Phelps herself
will be able to provide the information, or because they do not seem likely
to produce a helpful answer. Obviously the final draft of this letter that goes
to Mr Bean will not show the struck through questions at all: they are
present in this precedent only for the sake of demonstrating the thoughtprocess.

Disclosure
4.34
There are two distinct ways in which the tribunal may approach disclosure
of documents. One is to follow the practice of the ordinary courts, as set out
in the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) and referred to as ‘standard disclosure’.
Here each party first provides the other (or others) with a list of all
documents in its power or possession on which they rely, or which support
or adversely affect any party’s case, and says which of those documents are
privileged.6 This is followed either by provision of copies of those
documents that the other party does not already have, or the opportunity to
view them and take copies.7
4.35
Alternatively, the tribunal may simply direct the parties to send each
other all the documents they want to rely on at the hearing. This is simpler

and cheaper for the parties as – in theory – it doesn’t require them to
conduct a search for relevant documents, draw up long lists, and admit to
the existence of documents they don’t particularly wish to disclose. The
downside, especially for the employee (since in most employment cases
most of the relevant documents will be in the hands of the employer), is that
the process may fail to turn up relevant and helpful documents because the
employer, not wanting to rely on them itself, doesn’t choose to disclose
them.
4.36
You may not have any influence over which of these two courses the
tribunal takes: often it will just send out standard directions without
consulting the parties. If you’re present at a preliminary hearing at which
case management is considered, you probably want to ask for standard
disclosure.
4.37
If an order for general disclosure has been made, then both parties are
obliged to comply with it fully and honestly, and in particular not to
suppress relevant documents that they regard as embarrassing or harmful to
their case. The tribunal can be expected to disapprove of any failure to
make full disclosure that emerges at the hearing, especially by a party that
has been professionally represented. Legal representatives have their own
duty to ensure that their clients understand and have complied with the duty
of disclosure.8
4.38
Even if an order for general disclosure has been made, never assume that
the duty has been properly complied with on the other side. The duty is
poorly understood by non-lawyers, and often inadequately explained by
lawyers to their clients. It will almost always be necessary to make specific
requests for documents that the respondent does not think relevant, or that it
has simply overlooked.
4.39
If no order for general disclosure has been made, there’s no reason why
you should not nevertheless ask the respondent to carry out a search for all
relevant documents, and ask it to confirm that it has done so.

Checklist for disclosure request

4.40
All organisations document their work differently, so there could be no
comprehensive list of the kinds of documents that it might be helpful to
request. The following lists may serve as a helpful reminder of some of the
possibilities. Again, requests for documents and requests for information
are closely related, and sometimes one will suggest the other.

General
Accident book;
accounts;
appraisal records;
bank statements;
call logs (some organisations log each telephone call received,
manually or automatically);
CCTV footage;
claimant’s personnel file;
clocking records;
company or staff handbook;
contract of employment;
diary entries (including electronic diaries);
disciplinary policy;
discussion papers;
e-mails;
file notes;
properties files associated with any suspect document;9
HR advice on conduct of interview, consultation or disciplinary
meeting;10
insurance claims;
letters;
log-books;
memos, minutes of disciplinary or appeal meetings (including any
handwritten notes taken at the time);
minutes of other relevant meetings;
order book;
pay records;

receipts;
recordings of telephone conversations;
reports;
requests from managers for human resources advice;
rotas;
sales records;
statement of particulars of employment;
tacograph (vehicle activity) records;
telephone bills;
text messages
timesheets.

Redundancy
Redundancy policy;
redeployment policy;
personnel records of other employees;11
redundancy selection criteria;
written records of process leading to decision to make redundancies;
other employees’ score sheets from the redundancy selection.12

Discrimination (especially recruitment discrimination)
Application forms, including the application forms of other candidates
for the post;
job advertisements (it may also be useful to find out where the
advertisements were placed);
person specification job description/role specification;
interview notes and/or score sheets;
written guidance for interview panel;
equal opportunities policy.
4.41
E-mail correspondence is particularly important, and is still often
overlooked or partially overlooked. Much that a few years ago would have
been the subject of a quick phone call is now dealt with by e-mail. People

tend to express themselves informally and candidly by e-mail, and they are
more likely to forget that their e-mails may come under scrutiny. Often they
will say in an e-mail things that they would not dream of putting in a letter
or a formal memo. For this reason, e-mail correspondence can be revealing.

Faked documents
4.42
Sometimes respondents rely on documents that they claim were created at
the time of the disputed events – but which they actually either created from
scratch, or edited to suit their purposes, after proceedings had started in
order to bolster their case.
4.43
If you think this may have happened in your case, take a very deep
breath. In truth, it probably does happen quite a bit; human beings aren’t
reliably truthful, especially under pressure – that’s just a fact about our
species. But if you make this allegation, there’s a danger that the tribunal
and the other side (especially if they are legally represented) will get
terribly excited about what a very serious allegation it is, and how
unreasonable it is of you to have made it unless you have good evidence of
it. Telling the tribunal what you genuinely believe the other side has done
has suddenly got you into very hot water.
4.44

Why? The background is that lawyers have a professional duty not to
make allegations of fraud in the absence of reasonably credible evidence.
Employment judges are lawyers by training and background, and they have
lived with this professional rule for so long that they will often tend to think
of it as a self-evident rule of ordinary good behaviour that everyone –
whether trained as a lawyer or not – ought to abide by.
4.45
That’s not really the case. We are all capable of maintaining strong
beliefs in the absence of any very good evidence; we ‘just know’. Probably
most of us overestimate our own ability to tell when someone else is lying
to us. So if you strongly believe that your employer is lying to you about
how a particular document came into existence, it’s not going to seem to
you unreasonable to make that allegation to the tribunal.
4.46
This is where the deep breath comes in. Because of the legal context, the
tribunal may well think it very unreasonable indeed of you unless you have
decent objective evidence – and considerably more than a personal hunch –
that the document has been fabricated. So don’t make an allegation of this
nature lightly – and certainly not just because the document damages your
case.
4.47
But with that warning, if you’re sure there are real grounds for thinking
that documents have been fabricated by the other side, you should
investigate. A point to bear in mind in this context (as in many others) is
that organisations are made up of a number of different individuals who do
not all have the same information or interests. The middle manager who
dismissed may have faked documents – unknown to the more senior
manager who confirmed the dismissal on appeal – as much to protect
himself from criticism inside the organisation as to defend the employer
from unfair dismissal proceedings. A faked document does not mean that
the employer’s whole approach to the proceedings is dishonest, less still
that their lawyers are in on the conspiracy. Never make wider allegations of
wrongdoing than you need to.
4.48
Creating a convincing backdated document is surprisingly difficult, and if
a document is under suspicion the first step is obviously to examine it

carefully for internal evidence that it is not what it’s supposed to be. For
example: a handwritten document that is said to have been created over a
period by different individuals may be suspiciously uniform, giving the
impression that it was in fact written by one person, using the same scratchy
ball-point pen, in a single sitting. Notes supposedly taken in the course of a
heated meeting by one of the participants may be implausibly perfect and
complete. A writer recording what is supposed to have been the present
when the document was written may inadvertently use a past tense, or
betray knowledge of information that was not available until later than the
supposed date of the document. Dates may be wrong. If the document is
one that is supposed to have been given to you at the time, you may even
have a different version.
4.49
Three specific techniques for testing the genuineness of suspect
documents are worth keeping in mind. First, any typed document put
forward as a contemporaneous record of a meeting or telephone call will
almost certainly have been typed up from handwritten notes. These should
be requested as well, so you can compare them.13
4.50
Second, documents created on a computer will have an associated
‘properties’ files showing when the document was created, edited and
printed; this is sometimes known as ‘metadata’. If the respondent discloses
what you believe are fake documents, it can be helpful to make a
supplementary request for the properties files. This too may be faked, of
course, if the respondent has the know-how and the will to do so, but if the
request is dealt with by someone who believes the document to be genuine,
or does not understand or bother to read the metadata, or indeed by anyone
who takes the disclosure duty seriously, information that seriously damages
the credibility of the original document may be disclosed. Alternatively, if
the respondent makes thin excuses for failing to disclose metadata, this in
itself may usefully damage their credibility. If grounds for suspecting the
document arises in the course of the hearing, it may be appropriate to ask
the tribunal to direct the respondent to have the electronic original e-mailed
to the tribunal the same day so that its history file can be printed and
examined.
4.51

Finally, if a document is sufficiently important and the claim is of
sufficiently high value, it may be proportionate to call in a forensic
computer expert to examine the computer, or to have the original document
analysed by an expert in techniques such as electrostatic document analysis
(a method of recovering faint imprints on paper from the pages above them,
suitable for handwritten documents under suspicion). But bear in mind that
you won’t persuade the tribunal to give directions for expert evidence
unless there is already some good reason to mistrust the document.14

Privilege
4.52
A document is said to be ‘privileged’ if, although relevant, it is exempt
from disclosure or cannot be relied on as evidence. There are three kinds of
privilege that commonly affect employment tribunal proceedings. They are
the ‘without prejudice’ rule, legal advice privilege and litigation privilege.
The first relates to communications in the course of negotiation and is dealt
with at para 6.14. The last two are superficially similar, but it is important
to understand the differences between them.

Legal advice privilege
4.53
Legal advice privilege protects all communications passing between a
lawyer and her client in connection with giving and receiving legal advice,
whether or not there are current or contemplated legal proceedings. This
means, for example, that you have no right to see a letter from your
employer to their solicitor seeking advice on the best way to dismiss you, or
the solicitor’s reply. Similarly, the respondent has no right to see
communications between you and your solicitor.
4.54
But what the rule doesn’t cover is at least as important as what it does.
Some employers may try to claim privilege in respect of every document
they don’t wish to disclose because they regard it as confidential, but legal
advice privilege is defined more narrowly than that.
4.55

Legal advice privilege does not extend to advice given before
proceedings are contemplated to either the employer or the employee by a
person who is not a lawyer, even if that person is acting in a role that is very
similar to a lawyer’s role. So, for example, advice given by the employer’s
human resources department to a manager on how to conduct a disciplinary
hearing, how to approach a capability or sickness procedure, how to select
for redundancy, etc, will not be privileged.
4.56
Similarly, legal advice privilege does not extend to advice from external
personnel consultants if they are not legally qualified, nor to
communications in the course of a disciplinary process between you and
your union representative. These kinds of communications should be
disclosed by each side.
4.57
This is widely misunderstood by both employers and employees.
Employers will often assume that they can’t be expected to show you what
they regard as ‘confidential’ human resources advice to managers. They
may refer to legal advice privilege in arguing that they shouldn’t have to
disclose this material; or they may simply omit it from their list of
documents altogether because they believe that it is none of your business.
If you believe that this kind of material exists you may have to make a
considerable fuss before you get it. The fuss is worth making, because if at
the time the advice was sought and given both the manager and the human
resources adviser believed that what they said to each other would not come
out in tribunal proceedings, the communications between them will be
unguarded and may contain material that is very helpful.

Litigation privilege
4.58
Litigation privilege protects from disclosure any document that was created
for the purposes of current or future litigation, and it protects
communications between unqualified advisers and their clients as well as
between lawyers and their clients.
4.59

The key distinction to understand is between: (a) documents that were
created at the time of events that have later become the subject of
employment tribunal litigation; and (b) documents that have come into
existence because of, and for the purpose of, the litigation itself. Documents
in class (a) will only be privileged if they are communications between a
qualified lawyer and her client for the purpose of legal advice. Documents
in class (b) will always be privileged.
4.60
It’s worth observing here that notes of a hearing taken by one party or its
legal or other advisers are not necessarily privileged.15 This will most often
be relevant if there is an appeal for which notes of evidence are needed, or a
remitted hearing after an appeal at which the claimant wishes to rely on
evidence given previously by the respondent.16
4.61
The other context in which you might want to try for the other side’s
notes is if the hearing isn’t completed in the time allotted and has to be
adjourned for some weeks or months before it can be finished. If you were
on your own, or with a friend who wasn’t able to take more than very
sketchy notes, but the respondent was there with a whole team of lawyers
and paralegals, the chances are they have good typed notes of the whole of
proceedings. Why not ask for them?
4.62
This is an application that both the tribunal and the respondent may find
surprising, but there’s no reason in principle why it shouldn’t succeed. It’s
probably not strictly within ‘disclosure’ as the term is usually understood,
but it’s certainly within the tribunal’s very general case management powers
under rule 29. Remind the tribunal that the overriding objective rule 2
requires, so far as practicable, ‘ensuring that the parties are on an equal
footing’. You’re not on an equal footing with your employer if, 8 weeks
after the first 4 days of the hearing, they have a complete and nearly wordfor-word transcript of the evidence so far.

Applying for an order
4.63

Once the deadline you’ve set in your letter making a request for documents
or information has passed, you should normally apply for an order straight
away. If the respondent asks you for extra time, it’s sensible to agree to that
if you can do so without damaging your chances of getting an order from
the tribunal if they fail to meet the new deadline.
4.64
So, for example, if you made your request with a 14-day time limit seven
weeks before the hearing and the respondent asks for another week to
comply, there’s reason not to agree: the tribunal won’t hesitate to make an
order four weeks before the hearing. On the other hand, if you made your
original request only four weeks before the hearing with a 14-day time
limit, you should probably request an order as soon as the time limit has
expired, even if the respondent is promising to comply any day. It may be
tactful to explain to the respondent that you’re making the application ‘just
in case’, and will be happy to write to the tribunal and withdraw it if they
comply meanwhile. An application for an order that doesn’t reach the
tribunal until a few days before the hearing is unlikely to be granted.
4.65
The application should explain briefly the relevance of the documents or
information sought; and it should be copied to the other side, with
notification that if they object to your application they should send their
objections to the tribunal as soon as possible. Sometimes the relevance of
the request is self-evident, in which case you can keep any explanations
brief; if it’s not self-evident, you may need to explain some background
first. If the respondent has given you reasons why they’re not prepared to
comply with your request, deal briefly with those in your application to the
tribunal.

APPLICATION

FOR

AN

ORDER

FOR

DISCLOSURE

OF

I should be grateful if you would put before an Employment Judge my
application for an order for disclosure in accordance with the numbered
request 6 of my letter of 24 September 2014, enclosed.
Reasons Part of the claim concerns an allegation that the respondent failed
to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the claimant’s disabilities.
The claimant’s GP wrote a letter to the respondent on 16 February 2014
setting out some of the difficulties that the claimant was suffering at work
by reason of new working conditions that had been imposed on her, and
suggesting certain adjustments. The respondent did not respond to this
letter, and it asserts at paragraph 17 of its ET3 that Mr Sharpe has no
recollection of receiving the letter, and that there were ‘some difficulties
with delivery of the respondent’s post around this time’.
My instructions are that there was a specific difficulty with delivery of the
respondent’s post in late 2013, but that the problem was resolved when it

was raised with the Royal Mail in January 2014. The correspondence with
the Royal Mail is relevant to the question how much the respondent knew at
what stage about the claimant’s disability and the disadvantages cause to
her by its working arrangements.
Rule 30(2) This letter is copied to the respondent’s solicitors, who should
write to the Tribunal as soon as possible if they object to my application.
Yours faithfully

Data Protection Act requests
4.66
The Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998 provides a means by which
individuals may require disclosure of certain kinds of information held
about them by any person or body. In many cases the employment tribunal’s
power to order disclosure of relevant documents will be an adequate means
of getting hold of information for an employment tribunal case, but a DPA
request will occasionally be helpful.
4.67
The two main limitations on what an employer (or other body) can be
compelled to disclose under the DPA 1998 concern (a) the manner in which
the information is held and (b) the nature of the information. Since a ruling
of the Court of Appeal in Durant v Financial Services Authority in 2003 a
restrictive view has been taken of both.17
4.68
Information is only covered by the DPA 1998 if it is either held on a
computer or as part of a sufficiently structured paper filing system.18
4.69
The effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Durant is that
information held in paper filing systems will not come within the right of
access provided by the DPA 1998 unless the filing system is sophisticated
enough that it can be readily discovered whether personal data are held in
relation to a particular individual, and if so, where in the files specific

information about specific individuals will be found. Paper files will not be
covered unless the information in them is similarly accessible to
computerised files. This means that only highly structured and wellorganised paper files are subject to the right of access.
4.70
The other limitation is the kind of information that is covered. The right
of access is not to every piece of information held on a computer or a
sophisticated paper file that mentions the individual making the request: the
information has to be about the individual in question, or to have him or her
as its focus. Suppose, for example, Mark Bowland, one of the characters in
the Saifur Rahman case above, makes a subject access request to the
hospital, and the hospital keeps computerised personnel records. A search
of those records by reference to Mr Bowland’s name will turn up his own
personnel file, but also Mr Rahman’s and no doubt several others, because
he line-manages Mr Rahman and has been mentioned in the latter’s
employment tribunal claim against the Hospital. Mr Bowland’s own
personnel file is clearly about Mr Bowland and he can demand to see it. Mr
Rahman’s file only mentions Mr Bowland in passing, and he is not entitled
to see it or even the parts of it that mention his name.
4.71
Under the DPA 1998, the person seeking information about himself is
called the ‘data subject’ and the body holding (or believed to be holding)
information is the ‘data controller’.

Making a request under the DPA 1998
4.72
A request is made by letter to the data controller. The data subject does not
have to know what kind of information is held about him or her, or where or
how it is held: the data controller must reveal its existence when asked.
4.73
The data controller may charge a fee of up to £10 for providing the
information, and must provide the information within 40 days of receiving
the request and the fee. The sensible course is to enclose £10 with the
request.

the last five years she has made a series of unsuccessful applications for
promotion. She has not been able to discover why her progress has
suddenly stopped, although she is now one of a small number of women at
her level of seniority and she has started to wonder if she has reached a
‘glass ceiling’. However, a manager recently told her that he thought it
ought to be obvious to her why she has stopped making progress. He said
that there were certain kinds of things on a person’s record that would
always stop them from reaching the highest levels. Ms Feldman was baffled
by this and demanded to know what he meant. He refused to explain, saying
only that she ‘must be realistic in all the circumstances’.

Questionnaires: pending abolition
4.74
The availability of statutory questionnaires is a long-standing and useful
aspect of procedure in discrimination cases. In 2012, the government
consulted on a proposal to abolish statutory questionnaires. Responses to
the consultation were overwhelmingly opposed to abolition, but in October
2012 the government announced that it intended to press ahead with the
reform anyway. Sure enough, the relevant repeal is at section 22 of the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.
4.75
But section 22 has not yet been brought into force, and no date for its
implementation has been announced. As a result, the situation is unclear:
the questionnaire procedure is available now, but by the time you are
reading this, it may have been abolished, or a definite date for its abolition
may have been set. But it also seems possible that the Government has
simply decided to ‘forget’ to implement this change.
4.76
Guidance on the use of the questionnaire procedure now appears at the
end of this chapter.

Your disclosure of documents
4.77
If you are the claimant, you need to be aware that you are under the same
duty as the respondent to comply properly with whatever order the tribunal
has made for disclosure of documents – that is, to disclose all relevant
documents in your possession or control, or to disclose all documents on
which you propose to rely at the hearing as the case may be (see paras
4.34–4.35 above). You will typically have less to disclose than respondent,

because normally it is the employer that holds the bulk of the relevant
documentary evidence. If you’re an adviser, be careful to ensure that your
client has understood the scope of the duty to disclose. The idea that there
might be a duty to show a former employer personal diaries, private letters
or e-mails, bank statements, telephone bills, etc may come as a surprise.
4.78
Again, you need to pay attention to what the tribunal’s direction actually
says about disclosure: if disclosure of all relevant documents in each party’s
power or control is ordered, then you as much as the respondent must
comply with it fully. The tribunal is likely to react badly if it becomes clear
in the course of the hearing that you have relevant documents that you have
not disclosed.
4.79
But the safest course in any event is to disclose all relevant documents
(other than privileged documents, as to which see paras 4.52–4.62),
whichever order the tribunal has made. A decision to withhold a particular
document because you don’t plan to rely on it and you don’t want the
respondent or the tribunal to see it needs to be approached with great
caution. The parties and their advisers have a duty not to mislead the
tribunal, so it will never be permissible to withhold a document that flatly
contradicts an assertion in the witness statement. There may be a relevant
document in your possession that gives a misleading impression, but even
so it will normally be better to disclose and explain it than to attempt to
suppress it.
4.80
Moreover, because there is always a duty of full disclosure in litigation in
the ordinary courts (with which the judge at least is likely to be familiar),
the tribunal itself can’t necessarily be relied on to understand that the same
duty does not automatically apply in the employment tribunal if a more
restricted order has been made. If you have withheld a relevant document
because you consider it misleading, you may find yourself in hot water with
the tribunal if you’re subsequently forced to admit to its existence. You can
argue that in the absence of a specific direction by the tribunal, there can be
no duty of general disclosure in employment tribunal proceedings because
there is nothing in the rules to impose it. But even if the tribunal accepts
this, it’s liable to regard your position as unco-operative and a bit shifty.

4.81
Below is a letter explaining this to a client. Bear in mind too that the term
‘document’ is not confined to material that already exists in paper form:
computer files, e-mails, etc should all be disclosed if relevant.

Dear Pauline
Case management order
I enclose a copy of the case management order from the preliminary
hearing last week. As you see, the next step is that the parties are required
to disclose to each other all documents in their power or possession relevant
to the case.
I probably have most of your relevant documents in my file already, but
please think carefully about whether you have any other papers relating to
the events leading up to your resignation. For instance, did you keep your
own notes of any of the meetings? Did you keep a diary? Did you send or
receive any letters or e-mails about the way you were being treated at the
time? We do not need to show the other side communications between you
and qualified legal advisers, but letters to or from the CAB or your Trade
Union rep may need to be included. If you are unsure about any particular
document, please send me a copy and I will advise on whether or not it
should be disclosed.
It is important that we disclose everything relevant at this stage as late or
incomplete disclosure will annoy the tribunal at best, and at worst could

damage our credibility and/or give rise to a costs order.
I hope you had a good time at the tractor event and Bilbo has recovered
from his adventure with the rat.19

Responding to requests
4.82
Some solicitors, when acting for respondents, will invariably make a
request for further particulars of the ET1, however much detail you have
put in your claim. Normally it’s simpler just to answer unnecessary
questions than to get into a debate about whether or not they’re legitimate.
But if you think the other side is trying to cross-examine you in detail in
writing before the hearing, you can refuse to answer. If they care enough,
they can always ask the tribunal to order you to respond. Broadly, questions
that seek additional detail on what it is you allege are legitimate; questions
that explore why you think the tribunal ought to believe your allegations are
not.
4.83

It’s helpful to repeat each request before answering it so that the letter is
a self-contained document that the tribunal can understand without
constantly referring back to the letter making the request.20 If there have
been reasonably co-operative dealings with the respondent, ask for the
request letter to be e-mailed so that this can be done by cutting and pasting
the relevant portions of the request.

Questionnaires
4.84
The questionnaire procedure is unique to discrimination claims. In any
discrimination claim, the claimant may, either before or after commencing
proceedings, serve on the respondent (or potential respondent) a list of
questions. The respondent is not obliged to answer the questions, and the
tribunals have no power to order replies to a questionnaire; but the tribunal
that hears the case will have regard to the questionnaire and any reply and
may draw inferences from a failure to reply or from evasive or incomplete
replies.
4.85
Before 1993, the employment tribunals had no general power to order a
party to give written answers to questions: it could order further particulars
of an employer’s response to the claim, and it could order disclosure of
documents already in existence; but it couldn’t order a respondent to
provide information such as statistics on the make-up of its workforce, or
lists of employees dismissed in the last year or so broken down by reason
for dismissal and ethnic origin.
4.86
That meant that before 1993 the questionnaire procedure was very
important. The tribunal’s power to draw inferences from inadequate replies
provided a sanction to encourage – although not compel – employers to
respond. After the 1993 Rules came into force the importance of the
questionnaire procedure diminished: general questions aimed at casting
light on how an employer treats ethnic minority staff, or women, for
instance, can be put as requests for written answers, and if the tribunal
thinks the question is relevant it can order the employer to respond.
4.87

But there are three significant respects in which the questionnaire
procedure can still provide real tactical benefits. The first is that it is
available before proceedings start, and can be used by an employee thinking
of making a claim to help decide whether or not the claim is well-founded.
This can be particularly useful in recruitment cases, where an applicant for
a job may have an uneasy feeling that he may have suffered unlawful
discrimination, but very little hard information about the employer or its
practices or even about the successful candidate for the job. In those
circumstances, the decision whether to proceed with a claim may well
depend on the reply to a questionnaire: if the employer gives a convincing
and legitimate explanation for its failure to recruit the aggrieved candidate,
that may be the end of the matter.
4.88
The second strength of the questionnaire procedure lies in the fact that
the tribunal has no power to order replies to a questionnaire. Ironically, this
may make the questionnaire a more powerful weapon in the hands of the
claimant. An employer faced with a list of requests for discovery of
documents or written answers which it considers excessively long and
detailed, or questionably relevant, can say to the claimant ‘We consider that
your requests are irrelevant and oppressive, and we are not prepared to
answer them without an order from the tribunal.’ The decision whether the
questions are relevant is then left to the tribunal. If the tribunal refuses to
order answers because it does not regard the questions as relevant, or
because it considers them excessive, it is difficult to criticise the employer
later for failing to respond. In other words, by this means the employer can
pass to the tribunal the decision whether or not the questions need to be
answered.
4.89
Faced with a long and detailed questionnaire, the employer doesn’t have
this option. It must make the judgment itself. This means that, if sensible, it
will play safe. It will normally be better for an employer to give more
information than would ever have been ordered than to risk giving the
claimant the opportunity to invite the tribunal to draw adverse inferences
from incomplete answers. So questionnaires will often be a way of digging
up more information than a tribunal would be likely to order an employer to
disclose.

4.90
This is deliberate. It is recognised both in the way the legislation is
drafted and in discrimination case-law that discrimination cases are difficult
to prove, and the relevant information will often be elusive. The standard
case-law on disclosure makes it clear that ‘fishing expeditions’ will not be
permitted. Discrimination is different: in discrimination cases, claimants are
provided with line and hook.
4.91
The third strength of the questionnaire procedure is that it can sometimes
elicit from the respondent, before disclosure, assertions that you can prove
to be false using documents that the respondent does not know you have in
your possession.

The form for the questionnaire
4.92
The questionnaire forms can be found on the Gov.uk website:
www.gov.uk/government/publications/process-for-complaints-under-theequality-act-2010.
4.93
The form includes a number of standard questions that must be
completed in all cases. The form asks you to set out what you say
happened, and why you think it was unlawful. Claimants and their advisers
almost invariably write here exactly what they have written (or what they
are going to write) in the claim form.
4.94
Then you add your specific questions at section 8, after a couple of fairly
pointless standard questions asking the employer whether they agree with
your account of what happened and why it was unlawful. Employers rarely
answer the latter question in the affirmative.
4.95
Section 8 is the point at which the real work of drafting the questionnaire
is done. It can be tempting to assume that it is good to ask as many
questions as possible at this point, or that a brief questionnaire is somehow
inadequate. Neither assumption is justified. There’s no need to dream up
questions for the sake of making the questionnaire look substantial. In some

cases it won’t be necessary to serve a questionnaire at all. If you can’t think
of any useful questions to ask at this stage it is better not to serve a
questionnaire than to serve a questionnaire putting a number of questions
that either don’t help the case or positively hinder it. And including a lot of
unnecessary detail can be an effective way of engaging the sympathy of the
tribunal on the side of the respondent and damaging its willingness to draw
inferences from failures to answer any good questions.
4.96
The advice at paras 4.21–4.25 above on making a careful choice between
questions to put in writing and questions to save for cross-examination
applies here too. You won’t be restrained by the tribunal from attempting to
cross-examine on paper by means of the questionnaire procedure, but it
doesn’t follow that it’s a good thing to do. If the case is strong enough,
demonstrating to the employer by way of a questionnaire that there are
pointed questions to which they don’t have good answers can help to lever a
settlement out of them without going to tribunal, but this is a high risk
strategy. If the case does still proceed to a hearing, some of the benefit of
effective cross-examination will be lost if they have been given the chance
to deal with the hardest questions at leisure and with the advice of their
lawyers.
4.97
It’s common to request documents as part of the questionnaire procedure.
The legislation permits tribunals to draw inferences from a failure to reply
to questions, or from evasive or incomplete replies to questions. It’s not
obvious that this also applies to a failure to provide documents on request:
probably an employer is entitled simply to say ‘Here are my answers to
your questions; if you wish for disclosure of documents, you must deal with
that after you have presented a claim under the tribunal’s power to order
disclosure.’ But requests of these kind can operate as an effective bluff: the
only way for an employer to find out for sure whether the tribunal will draw
adverse inferences from its decision to withhold documents is to withhold
them. Most employers won’t want to take the risk, so requests for
documents in a questionnaire are worthwhile.

Checklist of subjects to cover in a questionnaire

4.98
As usual with checklists in this book, this isn’t – and couldn’t be –
exhaustive. It’s intended to suggest ideas about the kinds of questions that it
can be useful to ask. In this list, for simplicity in illustrating the ideas,
examples are restricted to sex and disability discrimination, and in the
former case it is assumed that the victim of discrimination is a woman.
These topics can easily be adapted to fit complaints of discrimination on
grounds of race, sexual orientation, or religion or belief.
the respondent’s equal opportunities policy, what it covers, when and
how often staff have been trained on it;
the respondent’s workforce profile – that is, the proportions in which
women/people with disabilities are found in the organisation, and what
levels of seniority;
the proportion of applicants for the job in question or similar jobs over
a defined period who were female or had disabilities;
if the complaint is about an allegedly discriminatory provision,
criterion or practice (that is, indirect discrimination) the relative
proportions of male and female employees who were adversely
affected;
whether the respondent has been the subject of any previous
complaints of sex/disability discrimination or whether a particular
individual has previously been accused of sexual harassment;
what adjustments to the workplace/the claimant’s job
description/working practices/the recruitment process have been
considered to deal with the claimant’s disability;
the reasons why the claimant was treated as she was;
the reasons why other individuals have been treated differently;
who made the decision to treat the claimant as she was;
how other employees have been treated, and, if differently, the reasons
why;
in a recruitment or promotion case, the qualifications and experience
of the successful candidate;
in a reasonable adjustments case, the cost of any adjustments the
claimant says should have been made and the employer’s resources; it

may sometimes be productive to explore the employer’s expenditure
on non-essentials if the employer is pleading poverty.

precedent P2.47.2: paragraphs 1–14 would go in section 6, and paragraphs
18 and 19 would go in section 7. Paragraphs 15–17 are about unfair
dismissal, so they wouldn’t go in the discrimination questionnaire at all;
and paragraph 20 says what Ms Phelps claims, so that doesn’t fit in either
section 6 or section 7 either.
Other questions (if appropriate):
1. Do you (the respondent) agree that the statement in section 6 above is an
accurate description of what happened? If not, in what respect do you
disagree or what is your version of what happened?
2. Do you (the respondent) accept that your treatment of me was unlawful
as I have set out in section 7? If not, why not? Why was I treated in the way
I was? (Questions 1 and 2 are written into the form for you.)
3. Have any of your partners or staff received training on the Equality Act
2010? Please give names and dates.
4. Do you accept that I am disabled for the purposes of the Equality Act
2010 in that (a) I have a facial disfigurement and (b) I suffer from
depression and agoraphobia?
5. Who made the decision that I should go to work in the pool of secretaries
after Mr Gentleman’s retirement in July 2013?
6. What alternatives, if any, were considered?

7. Why was my suggestion that I should work full-time for Miss Grey from
August 2013 rejected?
8. What adjustments did you consider making from August 2013 to prevent
the arrangements for working in the pool of secretaries from placing me at a
substantial disadvantage compared to persons who were not disabled?
9. What steps were taken to investigate my condition or to assess what
adjustments might helpfully be made to prevent working in the pool of
secretaries from placing me at a substantial disadvantage?
10. Why was there no reply to my GP’s letter of 16 February 2014?
11. Who took the decision that morning reception should be covered during
the maternity leave of Alison Sheppard by members of the pool?
12. Who took the decision that I should be included on the reception rota?
13. What arrangements did you consider making to prevent the
arrangements for morning reception cover from placing me at a substantial
disadvantage compared to persons who were not disabled?
14. Do you have an equal opportunities policy? Please provide a copy.

Notes
1 This is a cross-examination point.
2 Pauline will know this.
3 Again, Pauline will know.
4 The point of these questions is to explore whether it is true that Miss Grey did not require sufficient
secretarial support to justify a dedicated secretary.
5 If Pauline says she does not believe there was a refurbishment at all, you might want to ask these
questions in cross-examination – or if the respondent calls a member of the typing pool to give
evidence, you might just want to see if you can get her to agree that the pot plants were indeed
moved specifically to give Pauline a bit more privacy.
6 See para 4.52.
7 The latter is inconvenient, and it’s rare for parties to choose to do it: normally they simply send
each other copies of the relevant documents in their possession.
8 See paras 4.77–4.81 below on your own duty of disclosure.
9 See para 4.50.
10 Employers may wish to claim privilege in respect of internal personnel or HR advice.
Communications with in-house lawyers are privileged, but advice from personnel professionals who
are not qualified lawyers is not and should be disclosed: see para 4.57 below.

11 Employers will often be reluctant to provide this on confidentiality grounds; they may refer to the
Data Protection Act 1998. Sometimes identifying details can be deleted from confidential documents,
but if information about another employee is important then the tribunal should be willing to order
discovery even if the employee says it is confidential. The Data Protection Act 1998 does not prevent
disclosure of relevant documents in legal proceedings and is irrelevant. The tribunal also has specific
powers under rule 50 to make orders to enable it to hear sensitive or confidential information in
private if necessary.
12 There’s likely to be a tussle over these; unfortunately British Aerospace plc v Green [1995] IRLR
433 makes it fairly difficult for a claimant to win that tussle. But if you want to make very specific
allegations about respects in which other employees have been scored over-generously to your
disadvantage, it’s a tussle you may need to enter into.
13 If the respondent claims that the handwritten notes were discarded once the typed document had
been created, this can be pursued in cross-examination. Any reasonably sophisticated manager can be
expected to know – especially if he has ever been through tribunal proceedings before – that original
documents should be filed alongside the typed transcripts as a matter of course.
14 See paras 5.90–5.91 on finding and instructing an expert witness.
15 Because they are a record of what has taken place at a public hearing: this can’t be confidential.
See Lambert v Home [1914] 3 KB 86, CA; and Comfort v Lord Chancellor’s Department
UKEAT/0137/05.
16 Where, for example, one of the respondent’s witnesses made helpful admissions under crossexamination.
17 [2003] EWCA Civ 1746.
18 Claimants who are employees of a public body who find limb (e) of the definition of ‘data’ at
section 1 of the Act may be led to think that this means that they are entitled to a much broader
category of information from their employers than other employees, but the impression is misleading.
Section 33A(2) excludes employment-related data from this definition, and the net result is that
public employees are entitled to the same amounts and kinds of information from their records about
themselves as any other employees. But other information (that is, information other than personal
data) held by employers that are public authorities may be accessible under the Freedom of
Information Act 2000, and in this respect they may be better-placed than private sector workers.
19 ‘Bilbo’ is the claimant’s cat. Obviously this last sentence is just friendly noise. But litigation is
stressful, and the rest of this letter could feel a bit starchy to an anxious client.
20 This can be generalised: letters and documents generally will very often do their job better if they
are self-contained than if they can only be properly understood by reference to other documents.

The role of witnesses
5.1
Witnesses are needed whenever there is a dispute about what happened.
One side’s witnesses tell their story; then the witnesses on the other side say
something between ‘No, it wasn’t quite like that, it was like this’, and ‘That
is a complete pack of lies from beginning to end. What really happened was
this ...’.
5.2
Very unusually the parties will agree entirely about what happened, and
disagree only over the legal consequences. For example: there is a written
contract of employment that says something ambiguous about the
circumstances in which employees will receive sick pay. The parties are
agreed that you were sick for a certain period in certain circumstances, and
that you received no sick pay; all they disagree about is whether in those
particular circumstances the contract entitled her to sick pay. In a case like
that, it may be possible to dispense with witnesses. To the extent that the
tribunal needs to be given some factual background, the parties may be able
to agree a factual account. These cases will be rare: witnesses are called in
the great majority of substantive hearings to tell the tribunal what happened.

Deciding who to call
5.3
Witnesses should only be called because they will help you win your case.
You don’t have a responsibility to make sure that the tribunal hears all the
relevant evidence. This is easy to say, but many people find it hard to
internalise. It’s easy to fall into thinking that a particular witness should be
called, simply because they can give evidence of something relevant.
5.4
In many employment tribunal cases, the claimant gives evidence himself,
but calls no other witnesses, whereas the respondent calls several witnesses.
This is not surprising. Most claims are, one way or another, about dismissal.
In most workplaces it takes several managers to dismiss a single employee.
5.5
Moreover, employment tribunal claims are almost exclusively about
events that have taken place in a workplace. The people who have first hand
knowledge of workplace events will mostly be those employed in that
workplace; and employees are understandably reluctant to make themselves
unpopular with their employers by giving evidence against them.1
5.6
It’s easy to feel that this stacks the odds against you: if the respondent has
five witnesses, you may feel you should be able to field a team of similar
size. This is usually a mistake. First, most tribunals can be trusted not to
decide disputes of fact on numbers alone. If Sister Winston and two other
nurses say that Mr Rahman shouted ‘I’ve had enough of your fucking
nagging’ etc, but Mr Rahman can provide no witnesses to support his
denial, Mr Rahman is very little worse placed than if the evidence against
him on this point were Sister Winston’s alone. Whether it’s Mr Rahman
against three nurses or Mr Rahman against one nurse, the tribunal will have
to decide who to believe. It won’t be surprised that none of Mr Rahman’s
former colleagues is willing to support him at the tribunal, so it won’t hold
this against him.
5.7
In fact, calling multiple witnesses to give what is basically the same
evidence is dangerous, particularly if the witnesses will face expert crossexamination. Making the truth sound honest under cross-examination can

be difficult, and sustaining a consistent lie under the same conditions is
extremely so. Calling three witnesses to give essentially the same evidence
gives the other side three shots at doing serious damage to the story in
cross-examination. Also, each witness must not only tell an internally
consistent and believable story; they must also tell the same story, or the
tribunal is likely to become suspicious.
5.8
This is not, of course, to be read as advice on how to maximise your
chances of getting away with telling lies to the tribunal. If you are a party or
a witness, you must tell the truth; and if you are a representative, you must
not call witnesses to give evidence that you know to be untruthful. But if
you are an adviser, you will sometimes have doubts about the truthfulness
of your client’s story. That’s ok – it’s the tribunal’s job, not yours, to decide
what really happened. Your job is to put forward the best case you can –
and that may well include deciding not to call witnesses whose evidence
you think the tribunal is likely to find implausible.
5.9
Witnesses are sometimes helpful, of course. A colleague may,
exceptionally, prove willing to risk the employer’s displeasure by giving
evidence about what took place in the workplace. If she can give relevant
evidence about something that you have no first hand knowledge of, this
can be very powerful. A relative or spouse may be able to give evidence
about the emotional effects of discrimination. A former colleague may have
relevant evidence to give. Sometimes expert evidence is necessary.
5.10
In general, witnesses should only be called if they have genuinely
relevant evidence about the central disputed incidents. Claimants often want
to put in character evidence, or references from previous employers, but this
kind of material is almost never worthwhile. If only the main participants
give evidence, the tribunal will have to decide who is most credible. If, in
addition, other people give evidence about the character of the main
participants, the tribunal will have exactly the same task, but will also have
to decide which of the character witnesses to believe. The problem of what
evidence to accept has just been moved around slightly, without making the
case any easier to resolve.
5.11

Sometimes, you may be disappointed to learn that the respondent does
not plan to call a particular witness, because you were hoping to crossexamine her. Generally it’s better to seek to capitalise on the witness’s
absence than to try to secure her attendance. If, for example, an important
meeting took place between you and a manager, but that manager isn’t
giving evidence and none of the other witnesses was there, you have an
important advantage. Nobody with direct knowledge is there to dispute your
account. Think carefully before giving up this advantage.
5.12
But if you believe that the reason why the respondent has decided not to
call a particular individual is that it expects her to be a disastrous witness
who will either agree with anything you suggest to her, lose her temper, or
be caught out in blatant lies (or ideally all three), you may wish to try to
secure her attendance.2

Statements
5.13
Witness statements are expected in England and Wales. In Scotland, the
practice is different: witnesses give their evidence by way of examinationin-chief. That is, the advocate on their side asks them a series of questions –
which should not be leading questions – aimed at giving them the chance to
tell their story.
5.14
A witness statement is simply the evidence a witness wants to give to the
tribunal, written down.
5.15
There will almost always be a direction to exchange statements with the
other side at least a week or two before the hearing. Even if this is not the
case the tribunal will expect to see typed witness statements on the day.
Some tribunals will refuse to hear from a witness for whom no written
statement has been prepared, or will order an adjournment (with the risk of
costs) for this to be done.
5.16
Normally, the tribunal will take some time at the beginning of a hearing
to read all the statements of the witnesses, or in a longer case, whichever

witness will give evidence first. Then, when the witnesses come to give
evidence they simply confirm that the statement is theirs and that it contains
their evidence. Then cross-examination begins. It is now rare for tribunals
to expect (or allow) witnesses to read out their statements.
5.17
The aim in drafting a witness statement is to set out, clearly and in a
logical way, the whole of the story the witness has to tell. Unless there is a
very good reason not to, the story should be given in chronological order.
Sometimes it is tempting to use a different approach. In a bullying case, you
might deal with what Mr Smith did, what Ms Jones did, then what Mr
Adam did. Where there are a number of different kinds of claim, you might
want to deal with each in turn. This is almost always a mistake. The first
thing that the tribunal will want to do is to figure out what has happened. It
is easiest and most natural for them to approach that in chronological order.
Any other approach, no matter how initially attractive, is likely to become
confusing and difficult.
5.18
When it comes to the hearing it is sometimes desirable to expand orally
on the witness statement, either because the statement is not as complete as
it should have been or because the witness wants to comment on new
allegations in the respondent’s witness statements.
5.19
Do this cautiously. Normally the tribunal will be reluctant to allow
prolonged supplementary questioning on top of the witness statement. In
any event, your aim should be to draft a complete statement, including all
the detail that you want the tribunal to hear.
5.20
Questions in response to the respondent’s statements should be asked
sparingly and only where the witness has something significant to add. If,
for example, your witness says in her statement that she agreed to work for
£100 per day, it is pointless to ask ‘Mr Jones says in his statement you
agreed to work for £50 per day. What do you say to that?’ The answer is
obvious (and, anyway, the point will have to be put to her in crossexamination).
5.21

If you are acting for yourself, ask the tribunal for permission to make a
short supplementary statement orally. It is important to keep this brief, since
the tribunal will be reluctant to permit an extended speech at this point.
5.22
Sometimes in complex cases the tribunal will direct the parties to
exchange supplementary witness statements after the main statements have
been exchanged. Again, if this is done it is important to include the whole
of the claimant’s comment on the respondent’s statements in the
supplementary statement: if supplementary statements have been permitted,
there is a real risk that questions in chief will be strictly limited.

Relevance
5.23
A witness statement should include everything relevant, and nothing
irrelevant. That sounds simple, but is actually difficult. It is particularly
tricky because tribunals tend to treat relevance as obvious, and get annoyed
with witnesses who find it hard to stick to relevant material – but without
being able to explain clearly what they mean by relevance.
5.24
So be aware of this as a potential pitfall. What you feel is important may
be very different from what the tribunal considers relevant. Material is
relevant if it is directly about the subject-matter of the complaint, or if it
tends to suggest that your central allegations are true.
5.25
It’s a good idea to think separately about each part of your evidence, and
make sure that you can if necessary explain to the tribunal why this
particular bit of the story will, if believed, help you win your case.
Example
The claimant complains of a number of separate instances of sex
discrimination. She feels that she has been undervalued for years, and has a
series of complaints against a number of different managers about failures
to promote her on a number of different occasions. She has had particular

difficulties at work since returning from a period of maternity leave two
years ago.
Most of the individual acts are more than three months before her
complaint, but the tribunal has agreed to extend time for events over the last
two years because they concern the same individuals and are connected.
The claimant is still very aggrieved about what happened when she worked
for a different branch of the same employer four years ago, but the tribunal
has refused jurisdiction to hear those complaints. The claimant may still
want to talk about what happened four years ago, and may feel that it is all
part of the same pattern. If it involves different individuals at a different
workplace, the tribunal will almost certainly say that this story has no
bearing on whether or not they should believe the claimant’s more recent
allegations.
If on the other hand the claimant says that the same manager who failed to
promote her also bullied a colleague into resigning shortly after her return
from maternity leave, this is plainly relevant. It is not part of the claimant’s
complaint, but it tends to suggest that this manager has a bad attitude to new
mothers.
5.26
If you are an adviser, a significant part your task in drafting the claimant’s
statement is to exclude irrelevant material, and at the same time to explain
to the claimant why it is irrelevant. If you don’t handle this sensitively, the
claimant may feel she has been stifled and prevented from telling the full
story. She may be keen to put that right under cross-examination. Most
tribunals will be tolerant up to a point, but if they are presented with a large
volume of irrelevant material they are likely to become impatient and to
start imposing strict limits on what they are prepared to listen to. It is far
better for the claimant to make carefully-judged decisions before the
hearing about what to include and what to leave out than to have a tired,
bored and impatient tribunal make those decisions in haste.
5.27
As well as excluding irrelevant material, the statement must cover the
relevant material in full. This advice is also easier to give than to follow. It

is necessary to have a clear idea of what conclusions the tribunal will have
to come to if you are to succeed, and then to ensure that you give evidence
in support of each.
5.28
This is where your list of issues comes in. If you haven’t already drafted
one, do so before you start – or at least before you finish – writing your
witness statement: see paras 7.28–7.34. Your list of issues is a list of
questions; your evidence needs to show the tribunal why they should
answer each factual question (so far as the relevant facts are in your
knowledge) in the way that you want them to.
5.29
All relevant evidence also includes material that is unhelpful to you, as
well as that which is helpful. If you or a witness will have to admit to
something unfortunate – such as behaving badly or having a grudge against
the respondent that might influence the evidence – it is almost always better
to deal with this upfront in the witness statement. First, this avoids the
witness appearing to have something to hide. Second, in the witness
statement the negative evidence can be put in context and explained. For
example, a claimant who swore at the manager conducting the disciplinary
hearing can explain why they lost their temper, point out that the manager
responded by swearing right back and that, once they’d both calmed down,
there was a mutual apology. This is much better than having the point
dragged out during cross-examination. The cross-examiner will have no
reason to allow the witness to explain. Indeed, they will want to make the
claimant look as bad as possible.

The truth
5.30
Witness statements have to be true.
5.31
It’s surprising how often this gets overlooked. The problem seems to be a
failure of communication between advisers, for whom the process is
routine, and witnesses, for whom it is normally a complete one-off.
Advisers tend to think it’s obvious that the witness must be satisfied that the
statement is all true: after all, it is a document that says at the top ‘statement

of Joe Bloggs’ and has a place at the bottom for Joe Bloggs to confirm that
the statement is true and sign it. Of course Joe Bloggs won’t sign it unless
he is convinced that it is true.
5.32
But there’s no ‘of course’ about it. We all tick boxes confirming ‘I have
read and accept the terms and conditions’ several times a year at least, when
what we really mean is ‘I can’t be bothered to read the small print, but I’m
willing to accept it on the gamble that there’s nothing too outrageous in it.’
In general, people who aren’t lawyers, (and sometimes even people who
are) sign on the dotted line when they are asked to without reading properly
what they are signing. A computer game company once wrote in a clause
assigning to them the immortal souls of the purchasers of one of their
games, subject to an opt-out; only 12 per cent noticed and opted out.
5.33
A witness statement is completely different. If you are a witness, you
mustn’t sign your statement unless the confirmation at the end that it is true
really does mean what it says. If your adviser has drafted something that
puts an inaccurate ‘spin’ on what you’ve told them, make them correct it. If
they have stated something as definite that you are unsure about, change it
so that the statement makes it clear that you are unsure. Putting your
evidence in writing in a clear and logical order and making sure it covers
everything it needs to cover is your adviser’s job. Making sure your
evidence is true is yours, and no one else’s.
5.34
Advisers can sometimes cross the line between presenting your evidence
clearly and persuasively (which is perfectly legitimate) and telling you what
to say (which is not). If there is a tussle over your evidence, it’s one you
need to win. If you come under explicit pressure to give evidence that is not
true, sack your adviser.
5.35
The best way of grasping the importance of this is to understand a bit
about what it is like to be cross-examined. Quite often there is a sequence of
questions that goes something like this:
Q: You have just sworn that your statement is true haven’t you?
A: Yes.

Q: And you approved and signed it a couple of weeks ago?
A: Yes.
Q: You wouldn’t have signed it without checking carefully that it was true?
A: No: [Actually – for the reasons given above – this is nonsense. All the
same, 99 witnesses in a hundred will give the ‘right’ answer to this sort of
question.]
Q: And presumably you’ve read it again recently?
A: Yes.
Q: So if there was anything in it you weren’t confident about, you’d have
corrected it before you swore to the tribunal that it was true?
A: Yes.
Q: So when you say at paragraph 12 of your statement that it was Tuesday
5 May that Sheila shouted at you in front of the whole office, you’re sure
that’s right?
A: Yes.
Q: And you’d remember that clearly, because it was the first day back after
the Bank Holiday?
A: Yes.
5.36
This is ominous. The respondent’s representative is working hard at
confirming the witness’s evidence about the date on which she says Sheila
shouted at her. She wouldn’t bother to do this unless she was pretty sure she
could prove this bit of evidence wrong. Her aim is to prove the witness a
liar, rather than merely mistaken or careless – hence the efforts to confirm
this bit of evidence first. The witness is almost certainly about to be taken to
a page in the bundle that proves – or seems to prove – that either she or
Sheila was out of the office all day on Tuesday 5 May.
5.37
This is why it is so important that witnesses take proper ownership of
their statements, and that advisers don’t put words in their mouths. If you
are a witness, read the first sentence in your statement, and imagine the
respondent’s representative taking you to it and asking you ‘Are you sure of
this?’ If the thought gives you a sick feeling, delete or rewrite the sentence.
Repeat for every sentence in your statement. When you’ve finished, and

made all the changes you need to make, you can sign your statement: not
before.
5.38
If you are an adviser, remember that the process of drafting a witness
statement starts with an interview with the witness in which you find out
what parts of the case they know about, ask them what happened, and write
down what they say. It does not start with you looking at the documents and
writing down what you would like them to say. Once you have a draft,
make sure that the witness understands that the statement is her statement,
not yours, and she must be sufficiently sure that it is all true to be
comfortable about swearing to it. It is essential that the witness has had a
sufficient opportunity to check the statement for accuracy before signing it.
If possible, it is preferable to send her away with a draft to read at leisure
rather than asking her to read it in an interview room while you wait: many
people simply cannot give the task the attention it needs if they are
conscious that someone busy is waiting for them to finish.
5.39
Remember that giving evidence in a tribunal is a once-in-a-lifetime
experience for most people, and witnesses are often confused about exactly
what their role is. One of the most heart-sinking things that can happen to
you if you are a representative listening to your witness give evidence is to
hear the employer’s advocate say ‘The statement at paragraph 24 is not true,
then?’ and the witness reply ‘No, it’s not.’ But there may be worse to come.
The next question goes, ‘So why did you put it in your statement?’ and the
witness answers ‘Because Miss Cummings told me to.’
5.40
If this happens to you as an adviser, probably you didn’t think you were
telling the witness what to say at all. You drafted a witness statement that
you believed reflected what the witness had told you. But what you failed to
do was make it sufficiently clear that ultimate responsibility for the contents
of the statement lay with her, not with you; and that the task you were
attempting was to draft a true account of what she had told you, rather than
telling her what she ought to say.

Hearsay

5.41
Hearsay is a much misunderstood concept, but there is no real mystery to it.
Hearsay evidence is evidence of a statement of another person given for the
purpose of proving the truth of that statement. Evidence is not hearsay
evidence just because the witness is reporting what someone else said.
Saifur Rahman’s allegation that he heard Lorraine Winston say ‘Give him
some Somnex’ is not hearsay. ‘Give him some Somnex’ is not a statement
of fact at all and is incapable of being true or false. Saifur’s assertion that
Penny Short had told him that no one had asked her what she had seen or
heard of the alleged incident is hearsay. The purpose of telling the tribunal
that Penny said this is to persuade the tribunal that no one had asked Penny
what she had seen or heard. Clearly the best witness of this is Penny, not
Saifur. That is why there has traditionally been a suspicion of this kind of
secondhand evidence.
5.42
There are procedural rules in the ordinary courts that have to be satisfied
if hearsay evidence is to be given. These don’t apply in the employment
tribunal, which is entitled to hear any evidence it considers relevant.
Nevertheless, it is fair for the tribunal to be sceptical of hearsay evidence
unless there is some good reason why the maker of the statement in
question could not herself be called to give evidence.
5.43
The claimant in an employment tribunal case may be at a tactical
advantage here. If Saifur Rahman failed to call Penny Short, he might be
criticised for that by the hospital’s counsel, who would say that the tribunal
should place little weight on this evidence because Penny was not there to
be cross-examined. But, if Saifur has failed to persuade Penny to attend and
give evidence because she is still employed by the hospital, he has a good
answer to this: ‘I can’t persuade Penny to attend because she’s worried
about souring relations with her employer. But you are her employer, so if
you say I’m misquoting her, or her statement is untrue, why haven’t you
called her?’
5.44
If you want to rely on hearsay evidence, it may be a useful tactic to alert
the respondent to this in advance and invite them to call the witness
themselves. It will be difficult for the respondent to protest that the tribunal

should place little weight on the statement of a witness who is not available
for cross-examination if it’s their fault that the witness is not available. The
letter should be put in the bundle for the hearing.

Dear Mr Bean
Saifur Rahman v St Julian’s Hospital NHS Trust
You will note when witness statements are exchanged that Mr Rahman will
give evidence that a care assistant at the Hospital, Penny Short, has told him
that she was present on the Coventry Ward when the incident for which he
was dismissed was alleged to have taken place, but no one asked her what
she had seen or heard. If she had been asked, she would have confirmed
that Mr Rahman’s collection of Mrs Goody had passed without incident.
Because Ms Short still works for the Hospital, we have not been able to
persuade her to give evidence for Mr Rahman. It is of course open to you to
call her if you wish.
Yours sincerely

Evidence distinguished from argument
5.45
The witness statement is not the place for legal argument, which should be
dealt with in submissions at the end of the hearing. For example, Saifur

Rahman describes who he told about the incident on the ward that troubled
him, but he does not go into why this was a ‘protected act’. That is
argument, which he or his representative will put in closing submissions to
the tribunal. If the respondent’s witness statements contain legal argument,
you should resist the temptation to cross-examine on it.
5.46
If in doubt, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t check with the judge that
she agrees that a particular assertion is legal argument and a matter for
submissions on both sides rather than cross-examination. Judges can be
unhelpful when faced with this kind of question, and say something like
‘It’s a matter for you what questions you want to put to the witness.’
Qualified lawyers and advisers acting for a fee or employed by an advice
agency have to take this. But if you’re a claimant representing yourself, or
an unqualified person acting for a friend or relative, you may wish to point
out (politely) that you don’t have legal expertise and the judge does: part of
the judge’s function is to provide this sort of guidance.
Example
An employer says ‘The claimant refused an offer of the same job only four
miles away from her home. All my other staff agreed to the move, and they
all lived more than four miles from the new office. I offered to pay her bus
fares and change her hours so that she didn’t have to travel at lunch-time,
but she refused everything and insisted she had to be within 10 minutes’
walk of home in case her mother needed her. I know her mother is old and
frail, but I’m running a business and I don’t have to make a good worker
redundant just because she refuses to commute a short distance to work.’
The first three sentences here are assertions of fact, and if the claimant
agrees that they are accurate then the employer need not be cross-examined
on them. The final sentence is a statement of opinion as to the law. It’s
wrong, but there is no need to take this up with the respondent in crossexamination. The point will be dealt with in your submissions.

The style of writing

5.47
The statement is a formal document, and where lawyers are involved it will
normally have been drafted by a lawyer. If you are an adviser, make sure
that the witness is aware that this is standard practice. Sometimes a witness
is asked in cross-examination: ‘Did you write this yourself?’ and the
witness, suddenly fearing that it will be thought improper to have signed a
document drafted by someone else, may be rattled enough to answer ‘Yes’
when it is obvious that that can’t be true.
5.48
The aim in drafting a witness statement should be to write a clear and
reasonably formal account, but using words that are within the witness’s
own vocabulary. You need to strike a balance between attempting a close
imitation of the witness’s natural speaking style – which in most cases will
be too informal – and drafting a document, parts of which, because of
complex vocabulary or sentence structure, the witness can’t comfortably
read aloud or even doesn’t understand. Credibility will be severely damaged
if it turns out in the course of questioning that a witness doesn’t understand
the meaning of some of the words used in her ‘own’ statement. Although
there’s no expectation that she has written it herself, she certainly should
have read it carefully and made sure that she was happy to swear to it.
Remember that the statement will have to be read under the stress of the
tribunal hearing. If in doubt, err on the side of simple, plain language.
5.49
A particular cause of problems in witness statements is the attempt to
avoid using the word ‘said’, as in ‘Mr Jones said that I should have called a
manager immediately’. Filling a statement with words like ‘indicated’,
‘confirmed’, ‘expressed’ or even ‘verbalised’ will just make it wooden and
difficult to read aloud. ‘Said’ is a neutral word that will go unnoticed by the
reader or listener and can be used freely.
5.50
Make the statement concrete and specific. If the claimant is a kitchen
assistant whom the chef has victimised by allocating her to all the dirtiest
and most unpleasant jobs, her statement should not say ‘The chef treated me
unfairly in the allocation of kitchen tasks’ – it should say ‘From
[approximate date when the victimisation started] the chef started allocating
me only to the pot-wash, cleaning the chip-fryers, and filling the pig bins.

These were all hot, smelly and unpleasant tasks, and everyone hated them. I
was never put on floor mopping, wiping the kitchen surfaces or table
clearing, which were the end of service tasks that everyone preferred.’
Similarly, if the claimant’s manager called her a ‘useless fuckwit’, her
statement should not say ‘My manager shouted and swore at me’ – it should
spell out the allegation in full. Sometimes claimants are hesitant to quote
abusive language in the formal setting of a tribunal; but the members of the
tribunal are used to hearing such stories, and will want to know exactly
what was said.
5.51
Tribunals have different preferences when it comes to referring to
individuals by name, and no approach will please all tribunals. Here each
individual’s full name is used when he is first mentioned; subsequently he is
referred to in whatever manner is habitual with the witness, thus: ‘In about
May 2005 I attended a probationary review meeting with my line manager,
Mark Bowland (known as Boley). Boley congratulated me on my
performance …’.
5.52
If a statement mentions ‘Mark Bowland’ once and then refers
consistently to ‘Mr Bowland’ it will be confusing for the tribunal if the
witness, in answer to questions, speaks of ‘Boley’. It is easier to make the
statement conform to whatever name comes naturally to the witness than to
expect the witness, under the stress of cross-examination, to remember to
refer to the person he knows as Boley as ‘Mr Bowland’ or ‘Mark Bowland’.
5.53
A statement should be set out in numbered paragraphs, one and a half
spaced so that there is space for notes. The ‘statement of truth’ is a
formality that has become common in the employment tribunals because it
is required in the ordinary courts. There’s no technical necessity for it in an
employment tribunal, but there’s no harm in conforming either.

DOCUMENT OUTLINE 5.53: Witness statement
If it is clear by the time the statement is drafted that there will need to be a
separate remedy hearing, this can go in a separate statement for the purpose.

PRECEDENT 5.53.1: Witness statement – unfair
dismissal for whistleblowing
IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No 123456/13
LONDON CENTRAL
BETWEEN
SAIFUR RAHMAN
Claimant
and
SAINT JULIAN’S HOSPITAL NHS TRUST
Respondent
STATEMENT OF SAIFUR RAHMAN
I, Saifur Rahman, of 25a Pepper Lane, London E11 2LL, make this
statement in support of my complaint to the tribunal of unfair dismissal:

1. I came to the UK from India to join my wife and baby son in July 2007.
After a short period working for a family business, I applied for a job at the
Hospital as a porter and started working there in December 2009. My job
was to transport patients and equipment from one part of the hospital to
another, as instructed by medical staff.
The claimant’s immigration history is not strictly relevant, but it sets the scene.

2. I was employed on an initial probationary period of six months. In about
May 2010 I attended a probationary review meeting with my line manager,
Mark Bowland (Mark). Mark congratulated me on my performance. He
said that he had heard very good things from all the medical staff I had
worked with, and he said that the patients liked me because I was gentle and
respectful with them. He said my employment would be confirmed. I got a
letter confirming me as a permanent employee the next day. I did not have
any other formal appraisals, but it continued to be clear that Mark and the
medical staff I worked with were very happy with my work. I also got on
well with patients.
The point of paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 is to establish Mr Rahman as a good, reliable
and caring employee whose employers think well of him. This is directly relevant
because it suggests that Sister Winston’s allegations are inherently implausible and
the Hospital should have regarded them with scepticism and investigated them more
carefully than they did.

3. In November 2010 I was promoted to the position of supervising porter.
4. Sometime in January or February 2014 I had a conversation with one of
the Sisters, who asked me about my career intentions. She said she thought
I was wasted as a porter and seemed to be picking up a lot about the
patients and their care. She asked me if I had ever thought about getting
qualified as a nurse. I had not thought about that before, but I discussed it
with my wife that evening and began to think about it seriously. I did not
know this Sister’s name except that I think she was known as Shaz, but she
was in charge of the ENT ward until about the end of March 2014.
5. On 26 March 2014 I was sent to Coventry Ward, a geriatric ward, to
collect a patient, Lisa Goody (Mrs Goody), for physiotherapy. Mrs Goody
was well into her eighties and frail and quite deaf, but she was still mentally
very sharp.

Mrs Goody’s mental acuity is relevant, because her age notwithstanding she could
and should have been asked what had happened.

She greeted me by name and said ‘How’s my favourite boy nurse?’ She
knew I was not a nurse, but she liked to tease.
Again, helping to establish that Mr Rahman is habitually kind to patients. ‘She liked
to tease’ shows that the ‘boy nurse’ comment does not mean she is not on the ball.

6. As I reached the ward I heard the Ward Sister, Lorraine Winston, say to a
junior nurse ‘Give him some Somnex, it’s the only way we’ll get any peace
round here. Don’t put it on his chart or the doctor will create.’ I think she
was referring to a patient I knew as Roy. Roy was quite far gone with
dementia and could be bad-tempered and difficult. Lorraine then looked up
and saw that I had heard what she had said. She looked flustered, and said
‘Only joking. You’d have to be a saint not to be tempted with some of
them.’
7. I was very worried about this. I knew about Somnex because my aunt,
who is in her eighties, suffered a serious stroke last year while she was on
the drug. It is a powerful prescription sedative, and it is dangerous for old
people. I did not believe that Lorraine had been joking, and I was afraid that
what I had heard meant that Roy was being given Somnex, without a
prescription or proper record-keeping, to keep him quiet. I knew Roy was
on a low salt diet, and I thought that might mean he was thought to be at
risk of a stroke, so I was worried that Somnex might be particularly
dangerous for him.
Paras 6, 7 and 8 explain the subject-matter of the public interest disclosure: Mr
Rahman is explaining what he heard and why it troubled him. It is important to
establish that his disclosure was made in good faith.

8. I reported what I had heard to Mark. I did not tell him about my own
family experience of Somnex because I am not an expert, but I thought it
was bad if a patient was being given prescription drugs without the doctors’
knowledge. Mark refused to take any action. He said ‘Don’t worry,
Lorraine’s been at the Hospital forever. She’d never do anything like that.’
When I pressed him he said, ‘What do you know about drugs?’
As this does not seem to have resulted in any action, it is not the relevant disclosure
itself, but it is relevant to explain that Mr Rahman started by raising his concerns at

the appropriate level and did not go straight to the Chief Executive.

9. On 2 April 2014 I wrote to the Chief Executive of the Hospital about
what I had overheard.
This is the disclosure.

10. On 3 April 2014 the Chief Executive replied promising that my
allegation would be looked into, and on 13 April I had a letter from Martin
Ogunfowora, a human resources manager, saying that my allegation had
been thoroughly investigated and no evidence of unauthorised medication
had been found.
This explains, implicitly, how Sister Winston became aware of the allegation.

11. That afternoon, I went to Coventry Ward to collect Mrs Goody for
another physiotherapy session. Sister Winston was on the desk doing
paperwork. She looked up and said to me, ‘You’re toast.’ I asked her what
she meant, but she just repeated, ‘You’re toast. Just you wait.’
This is not hearsay: Mr Rahman does not quote it in order to persuade the tribunal
that he is toast, but to persuade them that Sister Winston had it in for him.

12. On 17 April 2014 I got a letter dated 16 April from Maisie Lee, another
human resources manager. The letter said that I had been accused of
swearing at a Sister in the presence of patients and junior nurses. It said I
was suspended with immediate effect, and there would be a disciplinary
meeting at 10.30 am on 27 April 2014.
13. Enclosed in the letter were copies of written statements signed by
Lorraine and two other nurses from the Coventry Ward, Sharon Foster and
Michelle Brown. All the statements said that when Lorraine had asked me
why I was late to collect a patient on 16 April 2014 I had shouted, ‘I’ve had
enough of your fucking nagging. Why don’t you take the fucking patient
yourself if you’re in such a hurry?’ The statements said I had then wheeled
Mrs Goody’s wheelchair out of the ward so fast that she had been
frightened and had cried out, and that I slammed the door behind me.
These two paragraphs are central: they deal with what Sister Winston did to
victimise Mr Rahman for his complaint.

14. I was shocked and astounded by these allegations. I have never sworn at
work in my life, and I would never shout at a nurse. I do not think I was late

to collect Mrs Goody, and I am sure Lorraine did not accuse me of being
late at the time. I am always careful to move patients gently so that they are
not frightened. I am especially careful with elderly patients because I know
hospital can be very frightening for them. I always try to treat elderly
patients as I would like my own parents to be treated.
This emphasises again why the employer should have found Sister Winston’s
allegations implausible.

15. I thought, and I still think, that the only possible explanation for the
accusation was that this was what Lorraine meant when she said ‘You’re
toast’. She meant that she was intending to make up a story to get me
sacked.
Strictly speaking Mr Rahman’s opinion on this subject is not relevant, but this
explains the basis for his complaint of automatically unfair dismissal.

16. I went to the disciplinary hearing on my own because although the letter
had said that I could ask a colleague to accompany me I did not want to tell
a colleague about these horrible accusations. I thought it would be all
around the hospital if I told anyone and I was afraid some people might
believe it.
This is of marginal relevance, but it bolsters Mr Rahman’s insistence that it would be
completely out of character for him to behave as alleged.

I arrived for the hearing at 10.10 am because I was anxious not to be late,
but the meeting did not start until 10.45 pm. No one told me why it was
starting late or apologised. They just called me in at 10.45 pm and started
the meeting.
This shows a cavalier attitude to proceedings by the employer.

17. I told the panel that the allegations against me were completely untrue. I
said that Mrs Goody would remember if anything like this had happened.
One of the panel said it would be completely inappropriate to ask a geriatric
patient that sort of question, and anyway there were three witnesses who all
said the same thing. This was the elder of two women on the panel: I think
it must have been Elaine Watson. They seemed to think that because there
were three nurses saying one thing and only me saying the other, the nurses
must be telling the truth.

18. I tried to tell the panel that I thought this was Lorraine’s way of getting
back at me for writing to the Chief Executive about her giving Somnex to
an elderly patient.
In other words, the employer was alerted to the fact that Sister Winston might have
an axe to grind …

The chairman of the panel said this was a completely separate matter that
had been investigated already. He said it was not relevant.
… but refused to take this into account.

Another member of the panel started to ask me a question about this, but the
chairman stopped her and said again that it was a separate matter and had
been dealt with. The panel member who wanted to ask the question looked
very much the youngest member of the panel. She seemed quite nervous
and blushed when the chairman spoke to her. From the paperwork I have
seen since I think she was Leah Tuckey.
That is, there was a member of the panel who was sympathetic to Mr Rahman, but
she was powerless.

19. Towards the end of the meeting the chairman of the panel said that this
was a very serious allegation and they would be bound to consider
dismissing me. He asked me if I would apologise to Lorraine if they
decided not to dismiss me. I did not see how I could apologise for
something that I had not done, and I told them that.
20. At about 11.20 am they told me to go outside and wait while they
decided what to do. I was given a cup of tea by someone in the personnel
office, but I had hardly started it when they called me back in. I do not think
I can have waited more than 5 minutes.
Always pin time estimates to concrete events in this way if possible.

When I went back in, the chairman told me that they had decided to dismiss
me without notice for gross misconduct. I asked if there was a right of
appeal, but the chairman said ‘It is all in the letter, but there’s not much
point appealing unless you are prepared to apologise.’ I remember that this
is exactly how he put it because I thought it was a bit odd that he referred to
the dismissal letter as if it already existed. I did not think they had had time
to write anything.

21. I was sent outside again. The chairman told me to wait while he wrote
the dismissal letter, but the personnel officer who had made me a cup of tea
brought it almost at once. I had the impression that they must have had it
ready before the meeting began. The letter said that I had a right of appeal
and could exercise it by writing to the Director of Human Resources. I did
not appeal because of what the chairman had said. I could not apologise to
Lorraine because I was not prepared to admit to having behaved in a way
that was inconceivable.
It will be argued for Mr Rahman that in this way he was effectively denied any right
of appeal.

22. I left the Hospital in a state of shock and went home to tell my wife
what had happened. She was very upset and cried on and off all afternoon
and evening.
Strictly irrelevant, but might help the sympathy vote.

23. My wife and I are friendly with Penny Short, a care assistant at the
Hospital. She lives close by and has a young daughter at the same nursery
as our son, and we babysit for each other sometimes. When she heard that I
had been dismissed she came round for tea.
It might be said by the employer that Penny is only supportive because she is a
friend, so it is better to admit to the friendship up front than to give the impression
that she is a purely neutral onlooker.

She told us that she had seen me arrive to collect Mrs Goody on 16 April
and she could have confirmed if she had been asked that I had collected her
quietly and without incident. She said she knew it was 16 April because that
was her first day back from leave. She said to me that no one had asked her
about the allegations that had been made against me.
This is hearsay: Mr Rahman seeks to establish that no one did ask her about the
allegation.

24. I have not yet been able to find another job, although I have made many
applications. I have had a lot of interviews, but employers always want to
know what my last job was and why I have left it. When I tell them I do not
hear from them again. I am now wondering if I should apply to do the
nursing diploma course full-time as there is no point in studying part-time if
I do not have a job.

This explains the level of Mr Rahman’s loss, set out more fully in his schedule of
loss.

25. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No.123456/13
BRISTOL
BETWEEN
PAULINE PHELPS
Claimant
and
SHARPE, GENTLEMAN & CO SOLICITORS
Respondent
WITNESS STATEMENT OF PAULINE PHELPS
I, Pauline Phelps, of 14 Strawberry Field, Gotherington, Cheltenham, Glos.
GL52 1AB, make this statement in support of my claim to the employment
tribunal:
1. I have a facial disfigurement caused by a bad scald when I was a toddler.
People tell me that it is not as bad as I think, but I was bullied about it at
school, and I have always been very self-conscious about it. When I was in
my teens I went through quite a bad period of depression, agoraphobia and
social phobia, but I managed to get a secretarial qualification. In my
twenties I worked for a few years as a secretary for a manufacturing

company a few minutes’ drive from home, but I gave up work to look after
my mother when she became ill in 1993.
2. My mother died in October 1995, when I was 32. I had coped while she
was ill, but her death left me quite seriously depressed, and I was not able to
look for work at all for some months. I just sat at home crying and feeling
useless. I didn’t go to the doctor about this at the time because I didn’t think
he could do anything to help.
3. I was introduced to Mr Gentleman in June 1996 by his aunt, Alice
Cleeve, who had been a close friend of my mother’s. Alice had been a great
support to me during my mother’s last few months. She knew I had trained
as a secretary, and she knew that because of my facial disfigurement I found
the thought of applying for jobs in the normal way very daunting. She said
she had told Mr Gentleman all about me, and he had said I sounded ideal.
4. I met Mr Gentleman a couple of days later, and he was very kind and
understanding. He said Alice had told him how shy I was with strangers. He
told me he had thought about that, and it shouldn’t be a problem, because I
could work in a back office where I wouldn’t have to see his clients at all if
I didn’t want to. He said that what he needed above all was quiet efficiency
and reliability. I told him that I suffered from depression, but that I didn’t
think it would stop me working, and he said he knew from Alice that I
didn’t give up when things were difficult. He introduced me to Margaret
Church, who was retiring, and we arranged that I would start work the
following Monday for a short handover period.
5. Mr Gentleman gave me some forms to fill in before I started work. One
was an application form, and there was also a questionnaire about my
health. Mr Gentleman said not to worry about the bits of the application
form that asked me why I wanted the job and so on – he said just to fill in
the factual information so that the firm would have it on file. I remember
the health questionnaire because it asked a specific question about
depression, so I had to explain in writing that I had suffered depression in
the past, but that I wasn’t receiving any treatment at the time.
6. Working for Mr Gentleman suited me very well. He was always goodhumoured and patient, even in the early days when I didn’t know legal

language and made a lot of mistakes. I admired him, and I worked hard for
him, and I got a lot of satisfaction out of making his life a bit easier when
he was busy. By the time he retired, I knew quite a lot about his work and
his clients and would often pass correspondence to him with a draft reply
attached. He used to say he didn’t know how he coped before he had me
working for him.
7. I did still go through periods, especially in autumn, when I felt very
down. Sometimes I took anti-depressants for a bit, but I don’t like taking
drugs and I always came off them again as soon as I possibly could.
Sometimes I was withdrawn at work, or even tearful. Mr Gentleman was
understanding, and didn’t try to jolly me along, and I managed not to take
any time off work. I am proud of the fact that in all the years I worked for
him I never took a day off sick. Sometimes, especially in winter, I found it
hard to get up early for work, and Mr Gentleman was flexible about that
too: he said if it suited me better to come in mid-morning and stay a bit later
to make up the time, that was fine with him as long as any urgent
correspondence got sent out by 5 pm.
8. I had dreaded Mr Gentleman’s retirement, because I had been so happy
working for him. But when it was announced that Madeleine Grey was to
be made partner, I hoped that she might take over Mr Gentleman’s room
and I could work for her. I had always liked Madeleine, whom I had got to
know when she was Mr Gentleman’s trainee.
9. The week before Mr Gentleman’s retirement in July 2013, I was called
into a meeting with Mr Sharpe. Mr Sharpe said he wanted me to join the
pool of secretaries. I was appalled by this suggestion. The pool is situated in
a large, noisy open-plan office on the ground floor of the building, and
anyone working in there has to go through the public waiting room if they
want to enter or leave the building, or even to make a cup of tea or go to the
lavatory. I told Mr Sharpe that I would find this very difficult. I didn’t say
that I saw the move as a demotion, but Mr Sharpe seemed to jump to the
conclusion that that was what I thought. I asked if I could work for Miss
Grey, but Mr Sharpe just said that would not work. He didn’t say why. I
don’t believe that there was any policy decision taken in 2011 to phase out
the use of secretaries assigned to individual solicitors, because I have heard

that Vicky Price, who was one of the pool secretaries when I was there, is
now working full-time for Mr Sharpe himself.
10. I started work in the pool on 18 August 2013. I hated it from the first
day. All of the other members of the pool were in their twenties and full of
high spirits and chatter. I felt terribly out of place. They were constantly
asking me questions if there was something in one of their tapes they didn’t
understand, or if they had a problem with their computers. They talked a lot
about their boyfriends and husbands and children, and I couldn’t join in
with that. I started to think they despised me because I was old and boring
and lonely. There was a constant succession of temps in the pool because
the other secretaries were always taking time off for minor illnesses, or
when their children were ill. I found that very stressful and upsetting,
because people I haven’t met before always look startled and stare when
they first see the left hand side of my face. I know the respondent says that
they used more temps in August 2013 than usual because of an outbreak of
the ‘winter vomiting’ virus, but I don’t remember August being unusual in
that respect. There were always lots of absences in the pool.
11. On 25 August 2012, I went to see Mr Sharpe to ask him to move me to a
different room. I was distraught, and I was in tears at various points during
the meeting. I told him I couldn’t concentrate at work, and I was having
difficulty sleeping. I said I was afraid I was getting depressed again. Mr
Sharpe made it clear he thought I was making a fuss about nothing. He said
I’d shown myself to be a survivor in the past and he was sure I would get
used to it in time.
12. I became more and more depressed and anxious over the next few
weeks. On 24 October 2013, I had a panic attack on the way to work. I just
started crying uncontrollably and had to pull over. It wasn’t a good place to
stop – I was on the dual carriageway – but I couldn’t carry on driving. I just
sat in the car shaking and crying. I was picked up by the police after about
half an hour and they took me to the Cheltenham General Hospital. I was
admitted for two nights and was then signed off work for 12 weeks. The
psychiatrist at the hospital prescribed anti-depressants.
13. I went back to work on 9 January 2014. I was dreading going back to
work, but at first it was not nearly as bad as I had expected. The other

secretaries were very welcoming and seemed genuinely pleased to see me
back. Several of them hugged me and said that they had missed me. They
had arranged between themselves to move my desk into a corner and screen
it from the rest of the room with pot plants. There hadn’t been a general
refurbishment of the pool office, although one of the secretaries told me that
when they had asked Mr Sharpe to authorise the purchase of additional potplants, including a climbing plant on a trellis to screen my desk, they had
just said the office was a bit dingy and they wanted to brighten it up. They
hadn’t told him that they were trying to make my working life easier
because they thought he didn’t like me and wouldn’t agree if they explained
that.
14. I also thought they were making a real effort to keep noise levels in the
room down for my sake. As well as talking less, and more quietly, in the
office, they were eating their lunch in a conference room when they could
instead of sitting at their desks and chatting through their lunch-break.
15. I still found the pool a stressful place to work. I was often feeling tearful
by the end of the day, and I started losing sleep again. I went in early and
left late, partly to catch up on work I felt I ought to have been able to do in
regular hours and also partly so that I wouldn’t have to go through the
waiting room when there were members of the public there. I took
sandwiches in and drank as little as possible so I wouldn’t have to go to the
lavatory very often. I was struggling, but I was just about coping.
16. I went to see my GP about the difficulty I was having sleeping, and he
wrote a letter to Mr Sharpe explaining that he thought my mental health was
suffering from the conditions in which I was working. He asked Mr Sharpe
to consider moving me to a different room. As far as I know, Mr Sharpe
never replied. I wasn’t aware of any problems with deliveries of post to the
office around this time. We had had some problems with the post about a
year previously, when a new postman was delivering our post to Sharpes
Bakers, at 3 High Street instead of Sharpe, Gentleman & Co, around the
corner on Abbey Road.
17. At the end of February 2014, Alison May, one of the receptionists went
on maternity leave, and a memo went round announcing that her position
would be covered during her absence by the pool secretaries on a rota. I was

horrified to see my name on the rota on 2 March 2014. I went to see Mr
Sharpe in tears and told him that she could not possibly sit at the front desk
dealing with members of the public. He said it wouldn’t be fair on the
others if he took me off the rota. I knew the other secretaries would
understand and I tried to tell him that, but he wouldn’t listen. He said it
would probably be good for me.
18. He sent me home, saying he hoped I’d get a good night’s sleep and be
calmer in the morning.
19. I lay awake all night, and went to see my GP the next day. He signed me
off sick for eight weeks.
20. I couldn’t imagine going back to work. The thought of sitting on the
reception desk made me feel cold and panicky. I went to see the
Tewkesbury CAB, and after talking to them I decided I had to resign. I sent
them my letter of grievance on 8 May 2014 and my letter of resignation on
11 May 2014.
This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

and her future employment prospects.

Preparing witnesses: how far can you go?
5.54
Witnesses must not be coached. That is to say, they must not be told what
answers to give, or rehearsed in their manner of giving them. If you are an
adviser, it is sometimes necessary to spell this out. The only permissible
answer to ‘What should I say if they ask me XYZ?’ is ‘You must tell the
truth’.
5.55

Although it is unacceptable – and for a lawyer, professional misconduct –
to coach a witness, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do to prepare
a witness. There are various steps you can quite properly take to make it
easier for a witness to give her evidence in a helpful and convincing
manner. Managers and personnel officers giving evidence for the
respondent will often have appeared as witnesses before or seen their
colleagues giving evidence in other proceedings. They may even have been
sent on special witness training courses. There is nothing wrong with trying
to level the playing field a little. There is advice on giving evidence at paras
9.27–9.34 but there are a few things you can do before the hearing.

Attending a hearing
5.56
It’s useful to attend an employment tribunal hearing to get an idea for the
feel of the process and in particular how cross-examination is conducted. If
your former employer is going to be legally represented, you should try to
see a hearing (or part of one) in which the respondent is represented.

Getting familiar with the bundle
5.57
If you’re a representative, provide your client with a complete copy of the
hearing bundle as soon as it’s available. If you’re representing yourself, you
should already be familiar with the bundle, but make sure. This is
important, because suggestions may be made in cross-examination that you
could show to be wrong by reference to a document in the bundle if you
could find it in time. So it’s worthwhile spending some time before the
hearing getting familiar with it.
5.58
If in the course of cross-examination you’re sure there is a document that
would help you to answer a question, but you can’t immediately find it,
there’s no reason why you shouldn’t say so and ask to be taken to it. In
general, if you’re giving evidence you’re entitled to assume that the lawyer
cross-examining you knows the bundle better than you do.

The oath or affirmation

5.59
Each witness will be asked how she wishes to give her evidence: that is,
whether she wishes to swear to tell the truth on the Bible or the Koran or
another holy book, or make a solemn non-religious promise, called an
affirmation. Generally this is established by the clerk before the hearing or
the relevant day’s evidence begins, but sometimes the judge will ask
immediately before the witness sits down at the witness table.
5.60
Occasionally, when asked this by the judge, a witness will say something
to the effect ‘I don’t mind’. This is the only bad answer to the question,
because it can give the impression that you take a casual approach to the
oath. So decide whether you will swear or affirm, and if you will swear, on
which holy book.3
5.61
There’s no rule that witnesses with a religious affiliation must swear
rather than affirm: it’s a purely personal choice that will not be questioned
by the tribunal. It is also a very bad idea to attempt to cross-examine about
it.

Translated witness statements
5.62
Sometimes the claimant or a witness does not have good enough English to
give evidence in English. An interpreter will be needed for the hearing, and
often for the purposes of drafting and approving the statement as well. This
calls for particular caution. Suppose the claimant is a Bengali speaker with
very limited English. The adviser speaks no Bengali, so interviews the
claimant through an interpreter and then drafts the witness statement from
her notes of that interview. The finished document, being written in
English, is not something that the claimant can read and check for herself,
so until it has been translated back to her she can’t properly be asked to sign
it or swear to the tribunal that it’s true. And it almost certainly isn’t
completely true: drafting a completely accurate witness statement from a set
of notes of an interview is rarely possible on the first attempt even when
adviser and client share a mother tongue.
5.63

The best course in these circumstances is to arrange a second interview
with the interpreter present at which the interpreter reads and translates the
statement sentence by sentence and corrections can be made. The statement
of truth should then say something like ‘I have had this statement translated
to me and its contents are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.’
5.64
At the hearing, the statement can be identified and confirmed as usual,
through the translator provided by the tribunal.

Witness orders
5.65
The tribunal has power under rule 32 of the procedure rules to order the
attendance of witnesses. The power (which is now in the 2013 Rules, but
was present in almost identical terms in the old rules) is mainly exercised
on the application of a party, most often in circumstances where the witness
is willing to give evidence but is concerned that without an order her
employer may not give her time off to attend the hearing. An application for
a witness order is made by writing to the tribunal. The letter should explain
briefly the relevance of the witness’s evidence and the reason why an order
is needed – for example, that the witness is unwilling to attend without an
order, or that the witness is afraid her employer will not give her time off.
The letter should also give the full name and address of the witness.
5.66
An application for a witness order is the only kind of application to a
tribunal that need not be copied to the other side: rule 92.

Dear Madam
Mr R Rahman v St Julian’s Hospital NHS Trust
I should be grateful for an order for Ms Penny Short to attend the hearing as
a witness in this case at the hearing listed for 11–13 November 2014.
Ms Short’s evidence will assist the tribunal in dealing efficiently and fairly
with the case because she was present on the occasion on which the
respondent alleges that Mr Rahman was guilty of the misconduct for which
he was dismissed. Ms Short will give evidence that the alleged misconduct
did not take place, and that she had no involvement in the respondent’s
investigation into the allegation.
Ms Short’s address is 123 Rodney Road, London N17 9EQ. She works for
the respondent as a care assistant and is unwilling to attend unless ordered
to do so.
Ms Short is due to sit an examination at 10 am on the first day of the
hearing. I propose to call the claimant first, and I think it is most unlikely
that his evidence will be completed until after lunch, so I should be grateful
if Ms Short could be ordered to attend from 2 pm only.
Yours faithfully

Should you get a witness order?
5.67
The difficulty for the claimant in an employment tribunal case is that
witnesses who might be able to give helpful evidence will more often than
not be employees of the respondent. They may well be unwilling to give
evidence because – rightly or wrongly – they fear reprisals by the employer.
There is only a limited amount of comfort you can give such a witness: it is
not accurate to say ‘They can’t dismiss you or victimise you for giving
evidence’, because in fact they can do either, and some will. Dismissal for
such a reason would give the witness a strong employment tribunal claim of
her own, and other reprisals would probably be actionable in their own
right. But most employees will feel that keeping their job or not being
victimised is preferable to having good grounds for a claim to the
employment tribunal.
5.68
A witness who is genuinely unwilling to attend the hearing and give
evidence presents a difficult problem. There are two kinds of unwilling
witnesses you might seek to call. The more common kind is someone who
is (or is believed to be) essentially supportive of the claimant, but is – as
outlined above – unwilling to be involved in tribunal proceedings out of
concern for her own employment position. Sometimes a witness will agree
to give evidence, and provide a statement, but then change her mind;
sometimes she will simply refuse to give a statement at all.
5.69
It is risky to apply to the tribunal for an order even if the witness has
previously provided a statement: you’ll need to make a judgment about
whether she will stick to her statement if forced to attend against her will. If
she hasn’t provided a statement and refuses to do so, the risks are even
greater: you have no way of knowing what she will say.
5.70
More rarely, a claimant may wish to seek a witness order compelling the
attendance of someone she knows will wish to support the respondent’s
case, but whom she wishes to cross-examine.

Hostile witnesses
5.71
If you call a witness whom you believe to be supportive, but who
effectively changes sides at the hearing, you may wish to cross-examine
her. It may, for example, be necessary to ask her why he has changed his
story, or suggest that the employer has put pressure on her.
5.72
Here you may well find yourself up against another of the unwritten rules
of the employment tribunals: ‘This is your witness’, you may be told, ‘so
you cannot cross-examine her.’ This will be news to most non-lawyers, and
it’s nowhere to be found in the procedure rules. It reflects the practice in the
ordinary courts. It is a practice that it is, broadly speaking, quite useful to
follow in the employment tribunals – though it would be nice if they wrote
it into the rules so that everyone could know about it.
5.73
A very large part of cross-examination is asking a series of leading
questions. If parties were routinely allowed to cross-examine their own
witnesses, the evidence obtained that way would be of little use. If the
adviser asks the claimant ‘Did so-and-so happen?’ and ‘So then you did soand-so?’ and ‘That was because you felt so-and-so?’ the tribunal won’t feel
they have heard the story from the witness at all. Instead they will have
heard the witness obediently agreeing to everything her representative has
suggested.
5.74
On the other hand, if a witness is clearly unwilling to give evidence
helpful to the party that has called her, then it does need to be open to that
party to cross-examine. In those circumstances, if the cross-examination is
effective, the evidence wrung out of the witness may be telling.
5.75
In the ordinary civil and criminal courts there is a body of rules, drawn
from both legislation and decided cases, on the circumstances in which a
party is to be permitted to cross-examine her own witness. In the tribunals
there are no comparable established rules, but it is clearly within the
tribunal’s general case management powers under rule 29 to permit crossexamination of a hostile witness if necessary. Any assertion (from the

tribunal or the other side) that the tribunal has ‘no power’ to do so is simply
wrong: if necessary the tribunal can be reminded of rule 41 of the procedure
rules:
The Tribunal may regulate its own procedure and shall conduct the
hearing in the manner it considers fair, having regard to the principles
contained in the overriding objective. The following rules do not restrict
that general power. The Tribunal shall seek to avoid undue formality and
may itself question the parties or any witnesses so far as appropriate in
order to clarify the issues or elicit the evidence. The Tribunal is not
bound by any rule of law relating to the admissibility of evidence in
proceedings before the courts.
5.76
Slightly different questions arise in relation to the witness, known to be
supportive of the employer’s case, whom you wish to cross-examine but
whom the respondent does not propose to call. This will very rarely be a
good idea.
Example
In Mr Rahman’s case, he will give evidence that Sister Winston told him
that he was toast. If the hospital does not call Sister Winston, his evidence
on that point will be uncontested. This is a significant advantage.
If Sister Winston attends, that advantage will be lost. No doubt she will
deny having said anything about toast. Forcing her attendance means giving
up a firm advantage in the hope that she will collapse under crossexamination. Unless there is good reason to think that she will, this isn’t a
good idea.
5.77
The best way of securing the attendance of such a witness, if it works, is to
pressurise the respondent into calling her. It’s perfectly fair to warn a
respondent that if they don’t call a particular witness who plainly has
relevant evidence to give, you will make a fuss about this in submissions

and ask the tribunal to draw inferences from that witness’s absence. If the
respondent buckles under pressure and calls the witness the goal is
achieved.
5.78
If the respondent refuses to call the witness, there are various options.
You can simply carry out the threat and draw the tribunal’s attention to the
letter. Most tribunals will see the point.
5.79
A second possibility is to request a witness order, but invite the tribunal
to call the individual as its own witness. Since the tribunal has power to
exercise any of its case management powers on its own initiative (see rule
29), it is clear that it must have power to order the attendance of a witness
who is not identified as either the claimant’s or the respondent’s witness. If
the witness is known or firmly expected to be hostile, it is advisable to
make it clear that the purpose of the request is to allow the claimant to
cross-examine the witness.
5.80
A third possibility is to ask the tribunal to order the witness to attend so
that you can cross-examine her. In the ordinary courts, where one party
relies on hearsay evidence, for example, there is a procedure under the Civil
Procedure Rules (CPR) for the other to apply to the court for an order that
the maker of the statement relied upon should attend for cross-examination
on the statement.
5.81
The powers of employment tribunals to order the attendance of witnesses
are broad enough to allow them to do this without a specific rule and there’s
no reason in principle why they shouldn’t adopt this procedure in an
appropriate case where it seems clear that there is a witness who has highly
relevant evidence to give but who has not been called by either party.

Dear Madam
Rahman v St Julian’s NHS Trust
I should be grateful if you would put before a judge my application for an
order for the attendance of Sister Lorraine Winston at the hearing of this
case on 11–13 November 2014.
Sister Winston is the nurse the claimant says made false accusations of
misconduct against him. The respondent has indicated that it does not
intend to call her. It is clear that Sister Winston has relevant evidence to
give, and it is also clear that she will not be a willing or co-operative
witness for the claimant. In the circumstances the tribunal is asked to order
her attendance as its own witness, and to make her available for crossexamination by either party.
Sister Winston’s professional address is:
Coventry Ward, St Julian’s Hospital, Commerce Way, London E11 1LL

Absent witnesses
5.82
Sometimes you will want the tribunal to receive evidence from a witness
who has given a statement but who is unable (or unwilling) to attend the
hearing. Tribunals will normally be willing to read the statement, but its
weight will be severely limited by the fact that the witness is not available
for cross-examination by the other party. Only use evidence from an absent

witness if it is obviously relevant and important; and be ready with a clear
and convincing account of why the witness can’t attend in person.

Expert witnesses
5.83
Sometimes it’s necessary to instruct an expert witness in an employment
tribunal case. This is most likely to arise if your case is about disability
discrimination, and your employer disputes that you have a disability; or in
other discrimination cases, if you say that your health has suffered as a
result of the discrimination. If you’re complaining that you were unfairly
dismissed for medical incapacity, you may wish to rely on medical evidence
that you weren’t incapable of work; or if you have been unable to seek
work, you may need medical evidence to see off an allegation that you have
unreasonably failed to mitigate your loss.4
5.84
Medical experts aren’t the only kind of expert it is ever necessary to call
in the employment tribunal. If there’s a dispute about the extent of a
pension loss, then if the claim is large enough it may be necessary to
instruct an actuary. A computer expert may be needed if there’s a dispute
about the implications of computer files or records. A handwriting or
document analyst may be needed if there is a sufficiently important dispute
about the genuineness of a document.
5.85
Under the old rules, there was a specific power to make orders ‘as to the
use of experts ... in the proceedings’. The only reference in the 2013
procedure rules to expert witnesses is tucked away in the rules specific to
equal pay claims based on ‘work of equal value’.
5.86
You might think that meant there were no special rules about the use of
expert evidence in the employment tribunals, except in equal value cases.
You’d be wrong.
5.87
Before the 2013 rules came into force, the use of expert evidence was an
area in which employment tribunals had a particularly strong tendency to
conduct proceedings as if they were bound by the provisions of the CPR.

For that reason, the previous edition of this book advised reading Part 35 of
the CPR if you thought you might want to rely on expert evidence.
5.88
Now, you should probably look at rule 10 of Schedule 3. Although in
theory this rule only applies in equal value cases, the whole of rule 10 apart
from paragraph (4) is perfectly applicable to any employment tribunal case,
and it seems quite likely that tribunals will adopt it as a guide even where it
doesn’t strictly apply.
5.89
You should also read De Keyser v Wilson, in which the EAT gave general
guidance about the use of expert evidence in employment tribunals.5 The
main points are as follows:
1) A party seeking to rely on expert evidence should ask the tribunal
for guidance and/or directions as to whether expert evidence will be
acceptable and what arrangements are to be made.
2) A joint expert is normally to be preferred.6
3) If a joint expert is used, the parties should agree how the costs of the
evidence are to be divided.
4) If one party is unable to contribute to the cost, then the other party
may reasonably choose their own expert. Even if this is the case, the
tribunal may attach more weight to the evidence if the other party
has been asked to approve or at least comment on the proposed
letter of instruction to the expert before it was sent.
5) The letter of instruction should tell the expert what questions she is
required to answer.
6) The letter should not take sides between the parties, but should ask
the questions in a neutral form, and should emphasise that the
expert’s main duty is to the tribunal rather than to either party.

Dear Madam
Pauline Phelps v Sharpe, Gentleman & Co Solicitors
I should be grateful if you would put before a judge my request for a
direction for a medical report in this case.
Ms Phelps’ complaint is of discrimination on grounds relating to her
disability. Ms Phelps has suffered from occasional bouts of moderate to
severe depression throughout her adult life, and she has a serious facial
disfigurement. The respondent denies that Ms Phelps suffers from a
disability within the meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010.
Medical evidence regarding Ms Phelps’ condition will be essential to allow
the tribunal to deal with the case efficiently and fairly.
Ms Phelps has for the last eight years been under the care of Mrs Roberta
Toms, a consultant psychiatrist at St Matthew’s Hospital, Bristol. Mrs Toms
has indicated that she is willing to provide a report. I should be grateful for
the Tribunal’s order that the claimant should be permitted to rely on expert
evidence from Mrs Toms on the question of the claimant’s disabilities, and I
suggest that it would be helpful to list the case for a case management
conference to discuss detailed arrangements for this together with any other
case management issues that arise.7
My unavailable dates during August and September are:8
1. Week beginning 12 August
2. Week beginning 19 August

Choosing an expert

5.90
In the case of medical evidence, the choice of expert will often be obvious:
the consultant who has been treating you is likely to be best-placed to give
evidence about your condition. In some cases it may be sufficient to ask
your GP for a report. If you are not under the care of a consultant, you may
need to contact your local hospital for a list of specialists in your condition;
alternatively the Equality and Human Rights Commission or a specific
disability charity may be able to help.
5.91
If these sources fail to locate a suitable expert – or if a non-medical
expert is required – two helpful websites that can put you in touch with
experts in a wide variety of fields are the UK Register of Expert Witnesses
(www.jspubs.com)
and
the
Expert
Witness
Directory
(www.theexpertwitnessdirectory.co.uk).

Paying for the report
5.92
The cost of any expert report will have to be met by the parties, so it is
important to be clear about how much it will cost and who will pay. If you
are an adviser you must not instruct anyone until you have proper
instructions from your client, including acceptance that they are incurring
an obligation to pay.
5.93
If you cannot afford to share the cost of a joint expert, the respondent
should be reminded of the suggestion in De Keyser that the evidence is
likely to carry more weight if the instructions are agreed between the
parties. Some respondents will, for this reason, pay the whole cost of a
jointly instructed expert.

Drafting the letter of instructions
5.94
Start the letter with a short, clear summary of what the case is about and
why expert evidence is needed. The questions on which the expert’s
opinions are sought should be spelled out, and the letter should end with

guidance on what needs to be included in the report. It is helpful to enclose
a copy of the practice direction that accompanies Part 35 of the CPR.
5.95
The most important – and difficult – part of the task is drafting the
questions for the expert. Part of the problem is that you are not likely to
know much about the area in which they are instructing the expert. It is easy
to feel intimidated or confused.
5.96
The best approach is to focus on what you need the expert for. In other
words, why are you calling the expert in the first place? This is likely to be
fairly simple: do you have a disability? Or, how long will you be unable to
work? Then break this larger question down into more detailed questions
that the expert can answer.
5.97
For example, if you’re bringing a disability discrimination claim and the
employer disputes that you have a disability for the purposes of the Equality
Act 2010, you will typically have to show:9
that you suffer from a physical or mental impairment;
that the impairment has an effect on your ability to carry out normal
day-to-day activities;
that the effect is substantial;
that the effect has lasted or is likely to last at least 12 months.10
5.98
The key is to realise that you don’t need to understand the expert’s field of
knowledge. That’s her role. You just need to identify the areas where she
can assist the tribunal, and formulate questions to help her do so.
5.99
The questions for the expert should be confined to matters on which she
can be expected to have an opinion by virtue of her particular expertise. So,
for example, a medical expert can sensibly be asked what the condition is,
how long it is likely to last, what its effects are or can be expected to be on
the claimant’s ability to do specific things. She should not be asked whether
the claimant is disabled within the meaning of the Equality Act 1995,

however, because that is a question for the tribunal to decide by applying
the correct legal test to the facts as it finds them.11

Dear Mrs Toms
Ms Pauline Phelps DOB 27.9.59
INSTRUCTIONS FOR MEDICAL REPORT
BACKGROUND
Ms Phelps has made a complaint to the employment tribunal of constructive
dismissal and discrimination contrary to the Equality Act 2010. She relies
on depression and her facial disfigurement and she says that working
practices imposed on her by her employer have placed her at a substantial
disadvantage compared to workers who are not disabled.
Ms Phelps’ former employer does not accept that she has a disability.

QUESTIONS
I should be grateful if you would provide a medical report dealing with the
following questions about the depressive illness for which I understand you
are currently treating Ms Phelps:
1. What is Ms Phelps’ current condition? How serious is it?
This will show whether or not she has a mental impairment.

2. What are the causes of Ms Phelps’ depression?
This may not be strictly relevant, but if depression has clear and comprehensible
causes that is likely to help the tribunal to believe that it is real and substantial.

3. What are the effects of Ms Phelps’ depression on her?
4. What treatment is Ms Phelps receiving for her depression?
The effects of medical treatment are disregarded for the purposes of assessing the
seriousness of the effects of an impairment, so it may be important to know what
treatment is being received and what the condition would be without it, see question
5 below.

5. To what extent would the effects of Ms Phelps’ condition be different if
she was not receiving treatment for depression?
6. Has Ms Phelps suffered from depression in the past? Please give a brief
account of her medical history in this respect, including any treatment.
This is relevant to whether the effects are long-term.

7. How long do you expect Ms Phelps’ current depression to last?
As is this.

FORM AND CONTENT OF REPORT
I attach guidance on the form and content of expert evidence from the
applicable practice direction. Please note in particular that the report must
contain the following two statements:
‘I understand my duty to the Tribunal in writing this report and I have
complied with that duty and will continue to comply with it.’
and

‘I confirm that insofar as the facts stated in my report are within my own
knowledge I have made clear which they are and I believe them to be true,
and that the opinions I have expressed represent my true and complete
professional opinion.’
My client will of course be responsible for your reasonable fee for this
report.
Yours sincerely
Natalie Cummings

Notes
1 This can be disappointing. Being willing to stand up to your employer over an injustice to a
colleague is not perhaps at the high end of heroism, but it is a rarity nevertheless.
2 For how to go about this, see para 5.65.
3 If you’re not sure which holy book to swear on, you should probably be affirming.
4 For mitigation, see para 10.39.
5 [2001] IRLR 324 EAT.
6 However, where medical evidence is needed the claimant will often have a strong preference to use
an existing medical adviser – often a consultant – who already knows her medical history. The
respondent will rarely agree to appoint the claimant’s own consultant as a joint expert, so separate
experts will often be unavoidable.
7 An alternative would be to propose detailed directions in this letter – especially if it has been
possible to agree them in principle with the respondent first – but a case management discussion
(CMD) will more often be necessary in a disability discrimination case.
8 It is obviously preferable to tell the tribunal unavailable dates at this stage rather than waiting for a
CMD to be listed and then asking for it to be postponed because it’s inconvenient.
9 The rules for what exactly the claimant has to show are complicated: see generally ELAH chapter
15.
10 An effect that is likely to recur is treated as continuing for these purposes.

Introduction

6.1
Most employment tribunal complaints end in settlement, and for good
reason. Hearings are stressful and expensive, and often you can achieve by
negotiation a settlement that is more important than anything the
employment tribunal could order. A favourable reference is the most
common example of this: tribunals have no power to order an employer to
provide a reference, but often an agreed reference is the key consideration
for a dismissed employee keen to get back to work. From the employer’s
side, the costs of a hearing can often be higher than the value of the claim,
and the employer will only rarely recover any of its costs after an
employment tribunal hearing. Even if the employer thinks the claim is
completely without merit, it may be cheaper to settle than to fight.
6.2
The psychology of a negotiation is often more complex than this. It is
always worth remembering that the practical and financial interests of the
two opposing sides are not the only significant factors affecting the
outcome. Where the employer is an organisation, the individual who is
taking decisions about the tribunal case may be more concerned to protect
his own position than to achieve the best outcome for the respondent. A
manager who has no option but to authorise payment to the claimant if the
tribunal makes an award may feel that it is safer to let this happen than to
take the decision to settle the case. The question ‘Why did you pay Poppy
Snook all that money?’ can be laid firmly to rest by the answer ‘I had to,
because that was what the tribunal ordered.’ The answer ‘because I thought
we would probably lose the case and anyway it was cheaper than paying
our lawyers’ locates responsibility for the decision with the manager.
6.3
The manager taking decisions about the case may be the same person
who decided on dismissal, or upheld the dismissal on appeal. Here ‘I
thought we were likely to lose’ would be very little different from ‘I made a
bad decision’. The manager may prefer to expose the company to the risk of
a large payment, after which she can grouse companionably to colleagues
and superiors about the anti-employer bias in the tribunal system, than to
limit the financial damage to the company by implicitly admitting fault.
6.4

The question of loss of face can affect negotiations, too, so being aware
of this can be an advantage. Making your former employer eat dirt may be a
tempting thought – but making them feel that they are striking a hard
bargain is much more likely to get you the best possible deal. Your aim in
negotiations is to make it as easy and painless as possible for the other side
to do what you want them to do. That’s part of the reason it’s normally
advisable to open negotiations in an optimistic position: if you ask for
£15,000 and ultimately agree to settle for £5,000, your employers can
congratulate themselves that they beat you down to 1/3 of what you wanted.
That in itself may help the lawyer on the other side to sell the deal to her
client or the personnel officer to sell it to the CEO. On the other hand, if
you open negotiations at £5,000 and then refuse point blank to budge, they
can only settle – humiliatingly – by giving you everything you’ve asked for.
The result is the same, but it will feel very different. Similarly, if you
produce a first draft for an agreed reference, it is prudent to build in some
elements that you are willing to concede if pushed. A client once
memorably compared this to the ‘crumple zones’ in a car; it’s a good
analogy.
6.5
In general, how good a settlement deal is can be judged in terms of how
it relates to the likely outcome if the case is fought. That is related to how
much is claimed, what apart from an award of money can be achieved by
way of a tribunal order, and how likely the claim is to succeed. The ideal
settlement is better than the likely outcome of a hearing for both parties.
This may sound far-fetched, but when you think about all the costs
(financial, emotional and organisational) of a hearing, it’s surprising how
often it can be achieved.

Early conciliation
6.6
At the time of writing, the government’s intention is to introduce
compulsory early conciliation with effect from April 2014: after that date, if
the change goes through, your claim will be rejected unless you have first
notified ACAS of the dispute and waited for an ‘early conciliation
certificate’ signifying that attempts to bring about a negotiated settlement

have failed. You can find details of how this will operate (so far as that is
clear at present) at paras 2.1–2.20 above.
6.7
The only significant difference between negotiating during the early
conciliation period and negotiating later on in proceedings is that during the
early conciliation period you won’t have paid your issue fee. From your
point of view, that makes it slightly easier to settle: your financial losses
won’t have been pushed up by a fee of £160 or £250 (see para 2.26).
Unfortunately this will operate in reverse for your employer: they may hope
that you won’t be willing to pay the issue fee, and may decide not to
negotiate at all until after you have started the claim.

The lawyers’ role
6.8
Lawyers and advisers add a layer of complexity to the process, especially
when the hearing is close. Once negotiations have reached a point where
settlement is looking more probable than not – and especially if
negotiations are complex and are taking up a lot of time – it is difficult for
lawyers to remain fully focused on preparation for the hearing. That can
give negotiations extra momentum: the closer the hearing approaches with a
settlement in prospect, the more nightmarish it will be for both sets of
lawyers if the deal falls through.
6.9
This creates a risk of getting badly caught out. The deal can always fall
through at the last minute, and there is a limit to how much pressure it’s
right to put on a client to accept a settlement that you consider good. But if
you’re an adviser, in the end you have to remember that it’s your client’s
case, not yours; and the point of the whole exercise is to provide a result
that the client can live with. If fighting a losing battle in the tribunal gives
the client a better sense of closure than accepting a modest settlement, then,
other things being equal, the battle should be fought. (The main ‘other
things’ that may not be equal are your duty not to waste the tribunal’s time
with unarguable points; and the position of whoever is funding the claim: a
trade union or insurer may pull funding if a settlement offer is unreasonably
refused.)

6.10
Bear in mind, too, that there is a theoretical possibility that the other
party’s apparent willingness to negotiate is pure sham, intended only to
disrupt your preparation for hearing. This is a distant risk, but it is wise to
proceed as if it could be the case if only because settlement is never certain
until the deal is done. Even if everyone is being straightforward, you’re in a
stronger position in negotiations if you are ready to go to the tribunal than if
you have let your preparation stall because you’re sure you are going to
settle.
6.11
The other reason to be wary of the momentum towards settlement is that,
especially if most of the negotiation has focused on the financial side of the
deal (which it normally does), it can put you in a weak position when it
comes to non-financial aspects. This is best headed off by thinking carefully
at the outset about what matters most to you; and then by making sure to
open with a clear statement of what, other than money, you’re looking for.
Example
Suppose a reference is the key issue for the claimant, but the employer has
an invariable policy of not providing references for employees they have
dismissed. There is a long negotiation about money that finally produces a
figure, the day before the hearing is due to begin, that’s acceptable to both
sides. Only then does the claimant’s adviser ask for a reference. The danger
is that by now both sides are behind with hearing preparation, and either
side (depending which has stronger nerves) may be forced into a deal that is
not genuinely satisfactory. Alternatively, the deal falls through and precious
preparation time has been wasted negotiating about something that was
never really the key issue.

Withdrawing free assistance
6.12
The position of voluntary sector advisers can be complicated by a need to
focus services where they are most needed. This is a legitimate concern,

and it’s perfectly proper to warn a client early in proceedings that
representation will be withdrawn if she refuses an offer of settlement that
you consider good.1 Provided the client has time to make alternative
arrangements, it’s fair to act on that warning. But it’s not fair to withdraw
representation on this basis within a few days of the hearing: by this time it
will be too late for the client to make any alternative arrangements, or to
prepare adequately to represent herself. If settlement negotiations break
down shortly before the hearing, even if that’s because the claimant is being
unreasonable, an adviser who has previously promised to represent should
not back out.

External factors
6.13
Finally, the potential power of seemingly wholly irrelevant factors shouldn’t
be forgotten. If the hearing is listed for a day on which England is due to
play Argentina in the World Cup, the party whose representative isn’t a
football fan will have an advantage over a party who is – or whose lawyer is
– desperate to see the match.

‘Without prejudice’ communications
6.14
Statements made – whether orally or in writing – in the course of
negotiations cannot be referred to in front of the tribunal. This is what’s
known as the ‘without prejudice’ rule. Letters dealing with a proposed
settlement are often headed ‘without prejudice’, and lawyers may preface a
conversation on the subject with a request for agreement that what is said
should be ‘without prejudice’. There’s no magic in the words: whether or
not they are used, settlement negotiations are exempt from disclosure to the
tribunal. The purpose of the rule is to allow parties to litigation to lower
their guard for the purposes of negotiation without weakening their position
in the event that negotiations fail. Sometimes letters are headed ‘without
prejudice save as to costs’. This means that although the contents of the
letter and any response cannot be shown to the tribunal before or during the
substantive case, one or other party may refer to these discussions after the

case has been decided in the context of a costs application. The main use of
this by respondents is to back an offer of settlement with the threat that, if it
is not accepted, they will apply for costs on the basis that your refusal
amounts to unreasonable conduct of the proceedings: see further at paras
6.89–6.92 below.
6.15
This means that negotiations should be kept separate from other
correspondence. If you mix privileged and non-privileged material in the
same letter, you create the potential for difficulties later if you need to show
the tribunal the non-privileged bits. These can be overcome – normally with
a thick black marker – but it’s easiest to avoid the problem in the first place.

It’s not over till it’s over
6.16
If you’re trying to settle a case the day before the hearing, bear in mind that
you can’t safely assume that the case is settled before either (i) both sides
have signed a settlement agreement, or (ii) both sides have told ACAS that
they are happy with the same COT3 wording. If you haven’t got to this
point before everyone goes home for the evening, you have to assume that
the case may yet go ahead. In that event you will need to go to the tribunal:
probably you will be able to put the finishing touches to the agreement
there, but if negotiations come unstuck at that late stage you will need to be
ready to fight the case.
6.17
This means that it’s important to make sure that everyone knows how
much time you have to achieve a settlement. If your client is going to be out
of contact for any reason after a certain time, you need to know this. But the
settlement process will be just as surely derailed if when you think you are
nearly there, the solicitor on the other side suddenly can’t get hold of her
client. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t say something like ‘I think
we’re nearly there, but I’m conscious of the time – can you make sure your
client is going to be available to give you instructions until as late as
necessary this evening?’ If it turns out that the decision-maker is planning
to catch an afternoon flight in order to attend the hearing, then he will be
out of contact once he gets on the plane. The sooner you know that that’s

your effective deadline for settlement, the better. Similarly, if you are using
ACAS, find out how late your ACAS officer will be available.

What should be included in a settlement?
6.18
The parties can make any lawful agreement to settle their dispute. The fact
that a settlement can achieve a result that a contested hearing could not may
be one of the key factors that persuades the parties to negotiate. Usually –
but by no means always – the most important aspect of the settlement is
financial, but often a reference will be important too. In many cases these
two will be the only or main benefits in return for which the claimant agrees
to drop his claim. It is important, however, to have an open mind to more
creative solutions in a suitable case.
6.19
What follows is a list of some of the elements that first the employee and
then the employer may want included in a settlement. Some of these are
self-explanatory; those that require further comment are dealt with below
under separate headings.
What the employee may want:
money
a reference
an apology
an admission of liability
to be allowed to stay for a defined period in tied accommodation
to keep the company car, or laptop, or other equipment
deletion or amendment of information held about him
confidentiality
a commitment by the employer to change some aspect of its
employment practices for the future
a promise that some of the employer’s staff will be required to undergo
some form of equal opportunities training
a promise to adopt and publicise an equal opportunities policy, or
redraft its existing policy

different hours of work
a promise to send the claimant on a particular course
a promise to move the claimant to a different department or office
a promise to move a colleague (eg, in a bullying or harassment case,
the bully or harasser) to a different department or office
a promise to appoint the claimant for the next vacant post of a certain
description (or to short-list him)
reinstatement or re-engagement2
to be allowed to keep the dog3
What the employer may want:
settlement without admission of liability
confidentiality
a promise not to denigrate the employer
settlement of other potential claims
return of company property (possibly including the dog)
repayment of the settlement sum on breach of terms by the claimant

Money
6.20
The obvious question is how much? In other words, what – in financial
terms – is a good settlement?
6.21
This depends on what you mean by ‘good’. In the end a good settlement
is one you are happy with. But this definition is not very useful in practice.
Claimants often feel they need advice about what is a good settlement
before they can decide what will satisfy them. At the same time, advisers
often work hard to persuade their clients that it is prudent to accept a sum
that the client considers disappointing.
6.22
If you have a near certainty of winning a fixed sum, you’d be foolish to
accept significantly less than that sum, plus your issue fee. If you have no
realistic chance of winning, you should accept whatever you can get. But
prospects of success are rarely so clear-cut. It is usually difficult to assess

with much confidence what the chances of winning are. And even if you
win, you might win more or less depending on how the tribunal approaches
compensation. You may win one part of a case, but not another. Or the
respondent may have brought a counter-claim that needs to be considered.
These factors make the calculation more difficult, but the same basic
approach applies.
Example
Ms Jones has brought an unfair dismissal claim and race discrimination
case against her employer. Her adviser considers that her unfair dismissal
claim is very strong (approximately 80 per cent chance of success). If she
wins the unfair dismissal she will almost certainly recover £10,000 and,
depending on the tribunals findings has a 50 per cent chance of getting a
further £5,000. Her race discrimination claim, however, is weak with only a
10 per cent chance of success. If she wins the discrimination claim she will
receive an injury to feelings award of approximately £5,000.
If you multiply the probability of each outcome by the amount received in
the event of that outcome, you can arrive at a reasonable settlement figure
of:
(80% x £10,000)+(80% x 50% x £5,000)+(10% x £5,000)=£10,500
6.23
The level of uncertainty, both of the chances of success and the amount of
compensation will determine the range of acceptable settlements. In cases
with a high level of certainty the range of acceptable offers will be very
small. Where matters are very uncertain the range of acceptable settlements
will be wide.
6.24
It is important to remember that this is a way of thinking about
settlement, not a precise method of calculation. In practice the decision to
settle and for what sum will be based on many factors that have little to do
with the merits of the case. If you have urgent debt problems, you may want

to settle a good claim for less than the tribunal might have awarded you,
because settlement will get you the money when you need it. Or a
respondent facing a claim that is likely to attract unfavourable publicity
may be willing to pay more to get rid of it, even if the chances of losing it
are small.4

A reference
6.25
References are sometimes treated by advisers as a side issue, to be tacked
on to an agreement if possible at the last minute but not to be made a dealbreaker once a sum of money has been agreed. This can be a mistake. The
most serious concern of an employee who has been dismissed will very
often be to get another job. A recent dismissal by an employer that isn’t
prepared to provide even a factual confirmation of job title and dates of
employment may be a significant handicap in the labour market; an agreed
reference may be the most important aspect of the deal. It can be helpful to
include an agreement that reference requests will be dealt with by a named
individual at the previous employer, particularly if there’s a suitable
manager the claimant trusts.
6.26
Don’t underestimate the value of open references. Many employers,
particularly of low-paid workers, will expect job applicants to bring
references with them to the interview, and won’t themselves go to the
trouble of taking up references from named referees. So an agreement to
provide a number of open references may be worth having. And a terse and
uninformative reference may be more useful than it might appear. Many
employers won’t be in the habit of producing detailed references even for
employees who haven’t brought tribunal claims against them. Particularly
in low-paid jobs, a few lines may be all that is expected. An over-elaborate
reference for an unskilled manual worker could even ring alarm bells with a
potential employer.
6.27
Employers’ attitudes to references vary widely. Some will simply refuse
to provide any reference at all for employees they have dismissed for
reasons of misconduct or poor performance; some will be willing to provide

a factual reference in these circumstances. Some employers won’t provide
more than a blandly factual reference for any former employee, however
well-regarded.
6.28
But if the content of a reference is negotiable at all, it’s worth taking the
initiative in providing the first draft. As tends to be the case in any
negotiation, it’s advisable to aim reasonably high and include more than
you think the other side is likely to accept: build in some points for the
respondent to win on.
6.29
Drafting a reference for a dismissed employee that sounds satisfactory
without being untruthful is an art. The model to follow – if you get this far –
is the over-priced boxed salad from a sandwich shop: three prawns, a
crabstick and a squirt of pink salad cream carefully arranged on top of a
large quantity of iceberg lettuce may fool the careless buyer into thinking he
has bought a ‘seafood salad’ worth £5.95. A bland account of job title, dates
of employment, duties made to sound as extensive and responsible as
possible, topped off with an endorsement of whatever can be honestly
endorsed, can appear to the careless reader to be a good reference.
Employers can sometimes be surprisingly flexible about this: even if the
employee was dismissed for serious misconduct it may be possible to
secure a reference that talks up her few good points and draws a charitable
veil over her misconduct or incompetence.
6.30
If the question of a reference looks set to become a deal-breaker, take
careful stock. Remember that the tribunal can’t order a reference. Claimants
sometimes think a positive tribunal finding will somehow ‘clear their name’
and may help them get another job without a reference. But nothing could
be further from the truth. If ‘I was dismissed from my previous job’ looks
like bad news to a potential employer, ‘I was dismissed from my previous
job but I took my employer to an employment tribunal and won’ is worse.
6.31
It follows that if the money offered is as much or more than you can
realistically hope to get at a hearing, it’s futile to let the settlement founder
on your employer’s refusal provide a reference. It’s sensible to let this
happen only if the sum of money offered is independently unacceptable: in

other words, if an agreed reference would be a sufficient benefit to persuade
you to settle your case at what is otherwise an undervalue. If that’s the case,
make sure your employer understands that that’s your position when you
negotiate.
6.32
The document outline below suggests the questions that a reference
might cover, in a logical order. Obviously it is better to leave a subject out
altogether if the only truthful statement that can be made about it is
damaging.

PRECEDENT 6.32.1: Reference – genuinely good
Jane Close
Jane Close was employed by the company’s Payroll Section for two periods
separated by maternity leave and career break, from July 1997 to February
2002, and from July 2004 until January 2013. She was first employed as a
Payroll Assistant (Scale 1/2), and subsequently progressed to the level of
Payroll Manager.
By 2012 Jane had overall responsibility for payroll administration for over
150 staff, and for supervising the work of two Payroll Assistants and a
Payroll Supervisor, all of whom she had trained on their arrival in the
Payroll Section.

Mrs Close was a highly competent and reliable employee who coped well
under pressure. Her attendance, time-keeping and general conduct were
exemplary. She took organisational, procedural and technical changes in her
stride and proved a competent and tactful supervisor of more junior staff.
She was well liked by colleagues, and we were sorry to lose her.
P6.32.2

PRECEDENT 6.32.2: Reference – superficially good
Richard Lightfoot
Richard Lightfoot was first employed by this Borough from 1985 until 1989
as a yardman at our Crowley Road depot. From 1989 to 1993 he was
employed as Assistant Caretaker at the John Russell School, and from 1993
to 2013 he was Resident Caretaker at St George’s School. In his last post,
he had sole responsibility for the cleaning of the school (a total of over
15,000 square feet), and he was also willing to undertake minor
maintenance and repairs. We found him to be punctual and reliable, and his
attendance record was good.5

An apology
6.33
The question of an apology can give rise to tension between advisers and
their clients. Claimants sometimes feel strongly that they should receive an
apology because they’ve been badly treated. Advisers, knowing that this is
something the tribunal can’t order – and maybe being dubious about the
practical benefit of an apology anyway – can become impatient if the
settlement offer is otherwise good, and this issue seems likely to become a
deal-breaker.
6.34
If you’re an adviser, bear in mind that your client’s peace of mind may
sensibly be among your litigation aims. An apology may not have a money
value, but emotions are real forces in the world, and an emotional value is
no less real for being incapable of being expressed in pounds sterling. But if
you’re a claimant, remember too that the tribunal can’t order an apology: so
if you refuse a sum of money in settlement because your employer refuses

to apologise, you are refusing one sum of money without an apology in
favour of a different sum of money and no apology. That only makes sense
if you think the tribunal is likely to award you more money than you have
been offered.

Admission of liability
6.35
Employers rarely want to admit liability. Unless there’s a practical reason
why you need an admission of liability, you should probably concede this
without too much fuss. But bear in mind that there are circumstances where
an admission of liability is important. There are two common situations
where this may arise. If the respondent is on the verge of insolvency and
may not be able to meet its liabilities for redundancy pay, an admission of
redundancy (or a finding of liability from the tribunal) will make it easier to
claim your redundancy pay from the National Insurance Fund. Similarly, if
you have insurance that will cover your mortgage repayments in the event
that you are made redundant (but not if you are dismissed for reasons
relating to capability or conduct), it will be important to insist on an
admission that redundancy was the reason for the dismissal. If there is a
good reason for insisting on an admission of liability, it will usually be best
to explain it to the employer.

Promises about employment practices in the future,
equal opportunities training for managers etc
6.36
Similar comments apply as to references, apologies etc: these things may be
worth asking for, but they will not be ordered by the tribunal.6

Reinstatement or re-engagement
6.37
In the rare cases where it’s possible to agree reinstatement or reengagement, this should be done by way of a ‘settlement agreement’ or a
COT3, or ordered by consent by the tribunal. An informal agreement to
withdraw on terms, although adequate in many cases, may fail to preserve
continuity on reinstatement or re-engagement. If continuity isn’t preserved,

the resumed employment will be insecure because it will be two years
before you have statutory protection from unfair dismissal.

Confidentiality
6.38
Employers tend to want to keep the settlement confidential, either because
they don’t want to give any encouragement to other employees who might
consider making a similar claim in the future, or simply to avoid loss of
face. Often this isn’t objectionable in principle, but don’t promise too much:
you’re bound to want to tell your spouse or immediate family about the
settlement, and your employer is just being silly if they want you to sign an
agreement that prohibits that.

Repayment of the settlement sum as a debt if the
claimant acts in breach
6.39
This is a clause that rolls off the word-processors of many respondents’
solicitors. It’s included in order to frighten you into compliance with the
confidentiality (or other) clause, and it will almost always be unenforceable
as a ‘penalty clause’.7 On one view this is a reason why you can sign up to a
clause of this nature with a light heart: it’s not worth the paper it’s written
on. But resist it if you can, all the same: its purpose is to cause you anxiety,
and it may have that effect even if you’re fairly sure it’s unenforceable.

Settlement of any other claim the claimant may have
against the respondent
6.40
These are common, and some respondents will refuse point blank to settle a
case without a general clause of this nature. They are difficult to draft
correctly and may often be ineffective.8 If there is in fact no other potential
claim, then there is nothing to be lost, and in these circumstances such a
clause is unobjectionable; the question whether it’s effective is unlikely to
arise. But do give the question whether you have any other potential claims,
because if you do have another claim against the employer there is a risk
that you will have signed it away.

6.41
If this kind of clause is included, it’s standard practice to qualify it with
something along these lines: ‘For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
agreement affects any rights the claimant may have in respect of personal
injury or accrued pension rights.’
6.42
The latter may be difficult to negotiate if the original claim has a personal
injury element – if, for example, you have alleged that harassment at work
has made you ill. In that case, the solution may be to include in the
settlement any personal injury of which you are aware at the time, but not
any latent injury. It’s important that if, for example, you fall ill years later
from the delayed effects of some chemical you were exposed to at work,
you should not be prevented from suing your employer for that.

Practicalities of payment
6.43
If you were employed by a large and reputable employer – and in particular,
perhaps, a public sector employer – you can be pretty confident that if they
say they will pay you £x by a certain date, they will. But supposing you
don’t trust your former employer further than you could throw the chief
executive’s desk?
6.44
The obvious solution to this is to agree that you will withdraw your claim
as soon as you receive payment – but not before. Even if you are
negotiating at the door of the tribunal, that may be possible: the respondent
may be able to make an electronic payment from a laptop in their waiting
room. If you have a laptop with you – or telephone banking set up – you
can withdraw your claim only when you have confirmation that the
payment has gone through. If the sum is fairly modest, you could even ask
for payment in cash. But bear in mind that a tribunal award is not
significantly easier to enforce than a settlement agreement. That means it
doesn’t make much sense to refuse an otherwise favourable settlement
because you don’t trust your employer to pay the agreed sum.

‘Final’ and time-limited offers
6.45
Always treat the respondent’s assertion that an offer is ‘final’ or ‘nonnegotiable’ with scepticism. Respondents’ advisers often describe their
opening offer as ‘final’ and proceed to make several more ‘final’ offers.
6.46
Sometimes there are good reasons for an offer to be strictly time-limited.
Barristers’ fees, for example, often become payable at the point that the
brief is delivered. Barristers need preparation time, so by a day or two
before a hearing (or longer if the case is listed for more than 3 or 4 days) the
respondent’s solicitor will be anxious to deliver the brief and let the
barrister start preparing the case. Once this has happened, the respondent is
committed to significant hearing costs and may well be unwilling to
negotiate further: the money they might have been prepared to spend on a
settlement has now been spent on legal costs.
6.47
But if the respondent tries to impose a tight time limit many weeks before
the hearing, you can probably take it with a pinch of salt: it may simply be
an attempt to bounce you into settling the case quickly, or even on
inadequate thought or advice. It’s a good idea to meet the deadline for a
response if possible, but if it is not possible – or not possible to take an
adequately considered decision in the time – it will very rarely turn out that
a day or so’s delay several weeks before the hearing date causes the offer to
be withdrawn.

Negotiating by letter
6.48
Negotiations frequently take place in a flurry of telephone calls in a short
space of time, with only the final agreement recorded in writing. But it’s
often helpful if you fire an opening shot in negotiations by way of a letter
setting out the strength (and sometimes admitting weaknesses) of the claim
and attaching a schedule of loss.
6.49

The letter should make sense. There’s no point drafting a schedule of loss
showing a claim for £50,000 and then writing a letter the gist of which is ‘I
have a strong case worth £50,000 which I am willing to settle for £10,000’.
If you’re willing to settle the claim for a fifth of its apparent value, there has
to be a reason why. If the letter fails to account for that, the respondent may
conclude that you know you can’t prove your case, or you have simply
decided that you can’t face a hearing. There’s a real sense in which you
need an excuse to offer settlement at a substantial discount, if that’s what
you have decided to do. If the weaknesses of the case are self-evident,
there’s no benefit in being coy. As so often, one eye needs to be kept on the
risk of a costs application: if your letters are reasonable and proportionate,
the risk of a successful costs application on the strength of the failure of
negotiations will be much reduced.
6.50
There are two negotiation errors that are common among beginners. One
is to make it obvious that the respondent is not expected to agree to the
proposal, by ending the letter with something along the lines, ‘I look
forward to hearing from you with your next revised offer’ or ‘The
claimant’s proposal is negotiable and I look forward to hearing from you.’
While it’s not recommended that you should say an offer is ‘final’ if it’s not,
it is also self-defeating to make an offer and at the same time spell out that a
lower offer is likely to find favour. For the same reason, it’s futile to suggest
a range of figures for settlement: indicating that the claimant would accept
an offer ‘in the range £10,000–£15,000’ won’t elicit the answer from the
respondent, ‘We’ll make that £15,000, then, shall we?’

WITHOUT PREJUDICE
Dear Sir
Mr Matthew Pointer v Tailors of Gloucester Street
I enclose a schedule of loss in this case, which as you see shows a total
claim of just over £10,000.
My client’s resignation under threat of dismissal for gross misconduct
clearly amounts, in law, to an actual dismissal. As he was denied a right of
appeal against dismissal on the ground that he had ‘resigned’, the dismissal
was procedurally unfair. There can be no serious doubt of this.
My client fully mitigated his loss within 8 weeks of his dismissal, so there
can be no credible argument that he did not do enough to mitigate.
However, I have advised my client that he is vulnerable on contributory
fault, and in the circumstances I have instructions to offer settlement for
£5,000.9
Yours faithfully
Natalie Cummings

Settlement meetings and mediation
6.51
Sometimes negotiations can be done better face-to-face than by way of a
series of letters or telephone calls. There are various different ways this can
happen.

‘Round table’ meetings
6.52
At any time during proceedings, either side could propose a meeting of both
parties and their advisers to discuss whether it is possible to settle the case.
For employers who are using solicitors, a meeting will be relatively
expensive (compared to letters and phone calls; not of course compared to a

hearing), so this is only likely to happen in cases where there’s quite a lot at
stake.
6.53
If your former employer suggests a round table meeting, it probably
means they are quite serious about trying to settle. It will mostly make
sense to agree to go to a meeting: just going to it won’t commit you to
settling the case unless you’re happy with what is offered, and it might
make it easier for you to get agreement on the things you care most about,
or understand more about the employer’s position. At the same time, it’s
possible to feel outnumbered and outgunned at this kind of meeting,
especially if your employer has lawyers and you don’t. If you do feel this
way, it’s perfectly legitimate to say that you would prefer to negotiate by
letter, so that you have plenty of time to think about anything they propose.
Or if you want, you can agree to a meeting, but only on condition that your
former employer’s lawyers don’t attend.

At the tribunal
6.54
Negotiations often take place ‘at the door of the tribunal’ – in other words,
immediately before the hearing begins, at the tribunal building. Sometimes
this is just because you have been negotiating up to the last minute the night
before, and although you got close to a deal before everyone went home,
you didn’t quite manage to settle the case and get it taken out of the hearing
list. In those circumstances, you may have agreed to meet the other side at 9
am at the tribunal in order to put the finishing touches to your deal, so that
by 10 am you can tell the tribunal that the case is settled. In other cases,
negotiations may only begin in earnest when the parties see each other at
the tribunal – perhaps because this is the first time all the people who would
need to approve a decision to settle the case have been in the same room, or
maybe because the barrister instructed at the last moment by the respondent
has just told them that they’re going to lose, and they’d better make you a
decent offer.
6.55
Either way, you can conduct negotiations however you like. If there are
lawyers on both sides, they may meet in the corridor and make offers to

each other and then go back to their clients to take instructions, and then
meet again to discuss revised offers. Or sometimes the parties might choose
to talk to each other, without their advisers present. If one of the witnesses
called by your former employer is someone quite senior that you have
always got on well with, it could make sense just to have a meeting with
that person. Or you might have a meeting involving everyone – in effect a
‘round table’ meeting at the tribunal. Ask the clerk if you need a private
room where you can hold a meeting: they will normally find you one if they
can.
6.56
If you are negotiating at the door of the tribunal, and you think you’re
making progress but will struggle to conclude a deal by 10 am, you can ask
the tribunal (through the clerk) for extra time. Tribunals will normally be
fairly patient about this: they are keen that cases should settle if possible.
But they will also be keen not to let unproductive negotiations dribble on
until there’s no longer time to hear the case, so if you’ve persuaded the
tribunal to postpone the start of the case while you negotiate, expect to be
asked for regular progress reports, and to come under pressure to start the
hearing if you can’t do a deal reasonably briskly. You may well be called in
to the hearing room from time to time to give an account of how
negotiations are going: the tribunal won’t expect (and isn’t entitled) to
know who has offered what, or what the sticking-points are, but they will
want you to say whether you’re reasonably close or have hit a major snag
that you may not be able to overcome.

Mediation
6.57
Mediation is a special sort of negotiation where there is a facilitator, known
as a mediator. The mediator is independent of both sides, and need not be a
lawyer. His job is to try to bring about a settlement by talking to both sides
in turn and looking for common ground. But – importantly – she has no
power to impose any particular outcome on either party. You don’t have to
enter into mediation at all if you don’t want to, but even if you do, there’s
no obligation to agree to anything at the end.
6.58

If you haven’t experienced mediation, it can be tempting to think it
sounds a bit pointless, and ask ‘Why don’t we just talk to each other?’ But,
if the mediator is skilful, it can be a surprisingly powerful way of settling
disputes. Even if the mediator is not especially skilful, there’s something
about having someone to talk to who is neither on your side, nor on the
other side, that can open up the negotiation in useful directions.
6.59
The problem with mediation, if you’re representing yourself, is the cost.
Mediators are trained professionals, and they often charge serious fees.
Occasionally, if they have enough at stake and are particularly keen to
settle, the employer will offer to bear the whole cost of mediation. You may
feel nervous about this, on the basis that if your employer is paying, the
mediator may be on their ‘side’. There are two points to bear in mind here.
First, it’s unlikely that many trained mediators would let who is paying
them affect how they conduct the process anyway; and second, even if they
did, the whole process depends on consent. If at any stage you feel you’re
being unfairly leaned on, or that the mediator is favouring the other side,
you can simply bring the mediation to an end.
6.60
For more on how mediation works, see the ‘practical advice’ section of
the website of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution.10

Judicial mediation
6.61
Judicial mediation is a special form of mediation where a judge acts as
mediator. Judicial mediators are not supposed, in theory, to bring their legal
expertise to bear on the cases that they mediate; but the reality is that
having an experienced employment lawyer as mediator may act as a check
on either party’s unrealistic views on the strength of their own cases.
6.62
One of the reasons that the tribunals offer judicial mediation is to
conserve their own resources, by reducing the number of cases coming to a
hearing. There’s no right to judicial mediation on request: the tribunal will
offer it in cases it thinks suitable. These tend to be longer cases, and
especially long cases where the claimant is still employed by the

respondent. It’s rare for judicial mediation to be offered in a case that could
be heard in less than three days.
6.63
Sometimes an employment judge will suggest judicial mediation to the
parties at a case management discussion, but the suggestion doesn’t have to
come from the tribunal: if you think mediation might help you to settle your
case, there is no reason why you should not ask for it.
6.64
Judicial mediation used to be provided for free, but a fee of £600 has now
been introduced. The fee is paid by the respondent, but if you think
mediation might work and your employer is baulking at paying for it,
there’s no good reason why you shouldn’t offer to split the cost. It’s
unlikely to be a good idea to offer to bear the whole cost: not having paid
anything towards the process may make your employer less likely to take it
seriously.

Different methods of settling a claim
6.65
There are various ways that a claim once started can be brought to an end
before the hearing. Broadly, you can withdraw your claim (either
unconditionally or in return for some promise from the respondent), or you
can settle it by way of an ACAS conciliated agreement or a settlement
agreement drawn up in accordance with Employment Rights Act (ERA)
1996 s203. In addition, it may be dealt with by the tribunal in a manner
agreed on by the parties. Each of these possibilities is considered below in
turn.

Withdrawal
6.66
If for any reason you decide not to pursue the claim, you can simply write
to the tribunal to withdraw it. The effect of withdrawal is to bring
proceedings to an end: see rules 51 and 52 of the procedure rules.
6.67
A decision to withdraw a claim does need caution. It’s possible that the
respondent will make an application for its costs on the ground that your

conduct of the case has been unreasonable. Withdrawal itself can’t be said
to be unreasonable conduct such as to give the tribunal power to make an
award of costs against you, but – especially if the claim is withdrawn at a
late stage – withdrawal may lead the tribunal to consider that you have
behaved unreasonably in failing to withdraw sooner, or in bringing the
claim in the first place. If you’re in serious doubt about whether to proceed,
you should make that decision as promptly as possible. If you can’t avoid a
last minute withdrawal, be ready with a good explanation of why that is so.
6.68
Sometimes it will be best to seek a settlement of the case on the basis that
you withdraw in return for the respondent’s undertaking not to make any
application for costs. If the respondent has previously threatened a costs
application, this is certainly worth doing. If there’s been no talk of costs to
date, you’ll need to weigh the benefit against the risk of prompting the
respondent to consider an application it might not otherwise have thought
of. This decision will depend in part on your assessment of the quality of
the advice the respondent is receiving: niche city employment firm Brisk &
Wiley LLP won’t overlook the possibility of applying for costs on
withdrawal; Bluster & Bodge Employment Consultancy Ltd might.
6.69
Cases are sometimes settled by an exchange of correspondence, or a
simple written agreement, in which the claimant promises to withdraw and
the respondent promises to pay a sum of money, provide an agreed
reference, etc. This is probably the most straightforward way of settling a
case, and it’s quite often used when settlement is reached on the day of the
hearing. Otherwise it’s surprisingly rare. Probably the reason for this is that
it’s widely known that an agreement to withdraw (or not to bring) an
employment tribunal claim is not binding on the employee unless it is
negotiated through ACAS or recorded in an agreement that conforms to the
requirements of ERA 1996 s203 (a ‘settlement agreement’).
6.70
This is true, but it may have created a myth that goes further than the
reality, and persuaded claimants and respondents that only a settlement
agreement or an ACAS conciliated settlement is effective. Suppose you
promise to withdraw and the respondent promises to pay you £5,000. The
respondent pays up, but you then change your mind and continue with the

claim. In this situation, ERA 1996 s203 has the effect that notwithstanding
your promise to withdraw, you can’t be prevented from continuing your
claim – although you will certainly have to give credit for the £5,000
received against any compensation you’re ultimately awarded, and
depending on the circumstances you could be at risk of a costs order if the
tribunal thinks your conduct of the case has been unreasonable. This means
an informal agreement under which the respondent pays first and you then
withdraw is a bad idea from the respondent’s point of view, because it gives
them no certainty that that really is the end of the case. Claimants have
nothing to fear, but respondents will normally – and understandably – be
unwilling to settle a case in this manner.
6.71
But if the agreement is that you withdraw your claim first, and the
respondent then pays within a set period of withdrawal, there’s no such risk
for the respondent. For you, there is the same degree of certainty as there
would be under an ACAS settlement or a settlement agreement: the
agreement is a contract, so if the respondent fails to perform its side of the
bargain the contract can be enforced, like any other contract, in the county
court. That’s exactly the situation where the case is settled in this manner at
the door of the tribunal.

ACAS conciliated settlement
6.72

The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is a
government agency that has the job of trying to broker a settlement in
employment tribunal cases. ACAS receives a copy of every claim to the
tribunal. A conciliation officer will be assigned to the case and will write to
the parties at an early stage to offer his services. The form on which ACAS
records an agreement is called COT3 (generally pronounced ‘cot 3’).
6.73
The ACAS officer is a neutral go-between who will convey offers and
counter-offers between the parties, but shouldn’t offer advice on the merits
or value of the claim. ACAS officers do in fact occasionally volunteer an
opinion on these matters, but they are not legally qualified and it’s not part
of their job to do so. Most ACAS officers are friendly and pleasant to deal
with, but do remember that they are strictly impartial and will convey any
information you give them to the respondent. So never say anything to
ACAS that you wouldn’t want the other side to hear.
6.74
The ACAS officer’s practical role can seem like little more than a postbox, but there are potential benefits. First, ACAS offers a simple way of
settling a case that’s widely understood: you will have no difficulty in
persuading the respondent that a settlement achieved through ACAS is
valid and binding. Second, in a case where feelings run high, using a neutral
go-between may be the only way of cooling the temperature sufficiently to
negotiate at all. Third, once ACAS notifies the tribunal that a settlement has
been reached, the tribunal will immediately take the case out of the list.
Once the ACAS officer has confirmed that the case is settled – even if a
settlement is reached after tribunal staff have gone home – you can rest
assured that the tribunal will be informed first thing the next morning, and
the hearing won’t take place. If you’re negotiating at the last minute without
the assistance of ACAS, you won’t be able to get confirmation after hours
that the case has been taken out of the list, so you may still need to attend.
6.75
If you approach ACAS after you have agreed a deal, the ACAS officer
may refuse to become involved at the last minute, so if a COT3 settlement
is desirable, approach the ACAS officer early in negotiations and keep in
touch throughout. At the same time, the fact that negotiations are

proceeding through ACAS doesn’t prevent you from speaking direct to the
other side if you feel that might help.
6.76
As a rule, not much turns on whether a particular stage of the
negotiations is conducted direct or through ACAS. But sometimes the
psychology of negotiations is delicate, and the decision can be affected by a
number of factors. Sometimes you’ll want to speak to the respondent or
their adviser direct to break a deadlock, or to persuade them that a clause
they’re insisting on is unnecessary. Sometimes you’ll simply wish to bring
home to the respondent how strong your claim is: if you genuinely feel
confident, you may be able to convey that confidence, and undermine the
respondent’s, more effectively in a direct conversation than through an
intermediary. On the other hand you may be conscious of weaknesses in
your case, and you may prefer to keep the respondent’s adviser at arm’slength to minimise the risk of letting that slip. Or the conciliation officer’s
telephone may just be engaged at the point when you want to put a counteroffer.
6.77
Once terms of settlement are agreed, the conciliation officer will record
them on the COT3 form, which will be sent out to the parties for signature.
It is important to note that the settlement is binding as soon as both parties
have agreed – usually over the telephone – to the words that will appear on
the COT3. If you change your mind between agreeing on the telephone and
receiving the COT3, it is too late: the case is settled.

settlement of his complaint before the Employment Tribunal numbered
123456/13 and any other claim arising out of his contract of employment or

its termination, provided that nothing in this agreement affects any claim
the claimant may have in respect of accrued pension rights or personal
injury. The respondent agrees to make the payment under this agreement
within 21 days of receipt of copies of this agreement signed on behalf of the
claimant.
2. On any request by any third party for a reference for the claimant, the
respondent will provide promptly and duly signed and dated on its headed
notepaper the reference attached as Schedule to this agreement, and only
that reference, provided that in the event of a request in the form of a
telephone inquiry or questionnaire, the respondent will respond in a manner
fully consistent with the contents of the Schedule hereto. At or before the
time for payment agreed at clause (1) above, the respondent will provide to
the claimant six copies of an open version of the agreed reference on
company note-paper, duly signed and dated and headed ‘To whom it may
concern’.
3. Neither party will disclose to any third party (including the maker of any
request for a reference for the claimant), save as required by law or to their
respective legal advisers and in the case of the claimant his immediate
family, the existence or content of this agreement.
SCHEDULE
[See reference for Richard Lightfoot at para 6.32 above]

Settlement agreement
6.78
If the parties settle before the day of the hearing without using ACAS, the
usual method is to draw up a settlement agreement that complies with the
requirements of ERA 1996 s203. Section 203 requires an agreement in
writing relating to the particular proceedings, which must identify an
independent adviser who has advised the claimant on the effect of the
agreement, and which must state that the conditions regulating settlement
agreements under the ERA 1996 are satisfied. The adviser must be a
qualified lawyer, or a person certified in writing by either a trade union or
an advice centre as competent to give advice and authorised to do so. The

adviser, whether a qualified lawyer or not, must be covered by insurance
against claims in respect of negligent advice.
6.79
Often the main reason for using ACAS rather than a settlement
agreement will be that the respondent’s adviser takes some persuading that
the claimant’s adviser, if unqualified, is a ‘relevant independent adviser’ for
the purposes of ERA 1996 s203. This is a legitimate concern for the
respondent: if the claimant’s adviser is not a relevant independent adviser,
then the agreement will still be enforceable against the respondent, but
won’t prevent the claimant from continuing with the case. If the claimant is
unrepresented, it’s common for the respondent to agree to pay his legal
costs of getting the necessary independent legal advice to make the
agreement binding.
6.80
A settlement agreement, like a COT3 agreement, is a contract which the
claimant can enforce in the county court if the respondent does not comply
with its terms.
6.81
The substance of a settlement agreement can be as simple or as complex
as the parties require: it is perfectly possible to draft a short, simple
settlement agreement that merely settles the case for a sum of money, or a
sum of money and a reference. The example below demonstrates the
formalities required for a settlement agreement, but its subject matter is
unusual in that it is dealing with a point of principle.

PRECEDENT 6.81: Settlement agreement – dealing with
a point of principle
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
This agreement is made between Alice Fearon (‘the claimant’) and Naff Tat
plc (‘the respondent’). The claimant and the respondent agree as follows:
1. The claimant’s complaint to the Employment Tribunal numbered
123456/13 against Naff Tat plc is withdrawn.
2. The respondent affirms its commitment to the dignity of all its staff at
work and undertakes to take the following steps to ensure and protect the
dignity of its staff:
3. The respondent will within 14 days draw up a draft dignity at work
policy dealing with personal privacy, sexual and racial harassment and any
comparable mistreatment on grounds of sexual orientation, religion or
disability, and submit the draft to the claimant for his approval. If the parties
cannot agree within a further 28 days on a final draft of the policy, it will be
finalised, taking the views of both parties into account, by Antonia Thwaite
of the Humane Resources Consultancy Ltd. Once finalised the policy will
be adopted by the respondent forthwith.
4. The respondent undertakes to bring the dignity at work policy to the
attention of all its staff within 14 days of its adoption, and to retain it in
force for a period of three years without further revisions.
5. The respondent will immediately institute a programme of equal
opportunities training, to be provided by the Humane Resources
Consultancy Ltd, for all managers of the grade P2 and above. Naff Tat plc
will ensure that all such managers have attended a two day course by 31
December 2014.

6. The respondent will amend its disciplinary policy with immediate effect
so that a manager who conducts a personal search of any staff member
without specific grounds to suspect wrongdoing will be guilty of gross
misconduct. It will bring this change to the attention of all its staff within 21
days of the date of this agreement.
7. On a mutually convenient date in June 2014, the Chairman and the
Human Resources Director of the respondent will meet with the claimant
and her legal adviser to review progress under this agreement.
8. The purpose of clauses 2 and 3 above are to mitigate the injury to
feelings suffered by the claimant as a result of unlawful discrimination
against her by the respondent. If these clauses are not fully complied with
by 31 December 2014, the respondent will forthwith pay to the claimant the
sum of £5,000 in compensation for her injury to feelings.
9. The relevant independent adviser for the purposes of this agreement is
Natalie Cummings of the North London Law Centre.
10. The conditions regulating (a) settlement agreements under the
Employment Rights Act 1996 and (b) settlement contracts under the
Equality Act 2010 are satisfied.

Consent orders
6.82
If settlement is reached before the day of the hearing, any one of the three
methods mentioned above – a COT3, a settlement agreement or agreement
to withdraw – can be used. But if settlement is not reached until the parties
are assembled at the tribunal on the day of the hearing, it may not be

possible to conclude a settlement agreement or a COT3 in time to prevent
the hearing from going ahead.
6.83
The only remaining way to settle the case is to ask the tribunal to make
some order that the parties agree on. In a simple wages claim, for example,
it may be possible to agree that the tribunal should find in favour of the
claim and order the respondent to pay a specified sum of money to the
claimant. But this will only work for orders that the tribunal has a statutory
power to order: mostly money. The tribunal can’t order confidentiality, or
the return of company property, or a reference, or many other things that the
parties may want to agree on.
6.84
So if a more complicated deal is done, the easiest way to put it into effect
is by way of withdrawal on agreed terms as discussed at paras 6.68–6.71
above. Respondents who might be nervous about this as a way of settling
the claim in advance should be reassured at this point by the fact that, if the
case is not to go ahead, you’re going to have to tell the tribunal then and
there that you wish to withdraw, and the tribunal will dismiss the claim.
Your remedy if the respondent doesn’t honour its side of the agreement will
be in the county court.
6.85
Sometimes one of the parties or the tribunal will suggest a ‘Tomlin’
order. This is a form of order, common in the ordinary courts, staying a case
for all purposes ‘except for the purposes of carrying the terms of agreement
into effect’. The difficulty with a Tomlin order in the employment tribunal
is that the tribunal has no power to enforce an agreement between the
parties settling their dispute, so the bit about ‘except for the purposes of
carrying the terms into effect’ is meaningless. That doesn’t mean that it’s a
disaster if the tribunal does make what it calls a ‘Tomlin’ order: the parties
will still have an agreement enforceable in the county court, much as if you
had withdrawn your claim on agreed terms.

Settlement after partial victory
6.86

If you win on liability at the hearing, or win part of your claim, the tribunal
will then very often invite the parties to try to agree between themselves
what the level of any award should be. Often it is beneficial for both parties
to settle at this stage. If you have been receiving social security benefits for
part of the period that the award will cover, settlement avoids recoupment
of those benefits.
6.87
However, if the finding on liability only represents a partial win for you,
you should first think carefully about whether there’s any prospect that you
might want to appeal the tribunal’s decision. Settlement without thought for
this may make any future appeal impossible; but if you insist that the terms
of any settlement must keep open your right to appeal, that will probably
make settlement impossible.
Example
Sufiya Halai is aggrieved by her employer’s decision to stop paying her
enhanced rates for weekend work. The dispute culminates in her resignation
and complaint to the employment tribunal of unauthorised deductions from
pay and unfair constructive dismissal.
The hearing runs for a day and a half, and after lunch on the second day the
tribunal announces its decision that Ms Halai has suffered unauthorised
deductions and has been constructively dismissed, but that she contributed
to her dismissal by 50 per cent by not being prepared to negotiate about the
enhanced pay. Ms Halai was out of work and receiving social security
benefits for just over three months before finding another job, and there is
no suggestion that she has failed to do enough to mitigate her loss. The
tribunal asks the parties if they would like 20 minutes to discuss whether
they can agree the amount of the award.
Ms Halai is disappointed to be told that she is partly to blame for the loss of
her job, but she knows that if the tribunal makes an award in respect of her
lost earnings while she was unemployed she will lose the jobseeker’s
allowance she claimed during that period. She agrees to accept £2,400 in
full and final settlement of her claim, and the tribunal duly records that

‘terms of settlement having been agreed between the parties, the claimant’s
claim for a remedy is dismissed on withdrawal’.
Ms Halai goes to see her adviser at the law centre and asks about appealing
against the decision that she was partly to blame for her dismissal. She is
told that she has settled her claim for a remedy and there is now no
possibility of an appeal: the case is closed.
6.88
If Ms Halai had seen this problem coming, she would have had various
options, but she would not necessarily have been able to solve it. She could
simply have told the tribunal and the respondent that she was not prepared
to settle because she wanted to take advice about appealing the finding of
contributory fault. If she had done that, then the tribunal would have made
an award in her favour and she would have lost money through recoupment.
She could have told the respondent that she was willing to settle, but only
so long as it was an express term of the agreement that she reserved her
right to appeal that finding of contributory fault. That would have been a
rational enough position for her to take, but it might well have made it
impossible to reach agreement. If the question of remedy was listed for a
separate hearing (unlikely on these facts, but possible where extensive
evidence and argument will be needed on remedy), she might have asked
the tribunal to stay the remedy hearing until after her appeal against the
finding of contributory fault.

Negotiation and costs
6.89
Respondents will often head settlement offers ‘without prejudice save as to
costs’ and will threaten that, if you don’t accept the offer, they will rely on
it, in support of an application for costs, as evidence of your unreasonable
conduct. This echoes the practice in the ordinary civil courts, where costs
will normally be ordered against a party who has won the case but failed to
recover more than has been offered. The Employment Appeal Tribunal
(EAT) has made it clear that this rule doesn’t apply in the employment

tribunals: the power to award costs only arises if a party has behaved
unreasonably, and misjudging by a moderate margin the amount that the
tribunal will award is not unreasonable conduct.
6.90
You may be at a real risk of a costs order if you have no reasonable
prospect of recovering more than has been offered: in other words, where
the offer is equivalent to the most that the tribunal can be expected to award
even if the claim is an unqualified success. This will be most likely in cases
where the maximum value of the claim is modest, and will be less than the
respondent’s costs of fighting the case; or where your case is very strong
and easily quantifiable.
6.91
If you have received an offer at this level, you should think carefully
before refusing it. There is authority that a claimant is entitled to continue
with the case for the sake of a finding of liability, but if that is your concern
it is advisable to make it clear to the respondent that an admission of
liability would make the difference. Similarly, the respondent’s insistence
on a confidentiality clause may be a legitimate sticking point: again, if that
is so, make it clear in writing to the respondent.
6.92
There is no reason why you should not turn the ‘without prejudice save
as to costs’ tactic on the respondent in a suitable case. If the respondent’s
defence is misconceived and the amount that you will recover is very clear
(in an unfair dismissal case where your losses clearly exceed the maximum
award for such cases, for example, or in a claim for statutory redundancy
pay), you can write to the respondent offering to settle for that amount and
warning that you may seek costs (or a preparation time order) if the offer is
not accepted.

The case is a complaint of automatically unfair dismissal for refusal to
work on Sundays. It wasn’t finished on the day of the hearing and has had
to be listed for a further day some weeks later: the respondent’s witnesses

have finished giving their evidence but the claimant has yet to be heard. The
claimant’s adviser takes the view that the claim cannot now fail, but the
claimant is anxious about giving evidence and wants to avoid completing
the hearing if possible.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE SAVE AS TO COSTS
Dear Carrot & Marrow
Mr Pool v Savemore plc
In light of the evidence given by your client’s witnesses at the hearing on 7
September, I invite you to consider urgently with your client whether your
defence is misconceived.
Two of your client’s three witnesses gave clear evidence that at the time of
Mr Pool’s dismissal they did not believe that he had any right to refuse
Sunday work. One of them appeared to maintain this belief even at the
hearing. Even more tellingly, Mr Harpar, who made the decision to dismiss
my client, gave unequivocal evidence that the only reason for the dismissal
was Mr Pool’s refusal to work Saturday night shifts. As the ‘Saturday night’
shift fell mainly on Sunday, your client’s own evidence points conclusively
to a dismissal for refusing Sunday work.
In the circumstances I take the view that persisting with the respondent’s
defence that Mr Pool was fairly dismissed for ‘inflexibility’ is unreasonable
and/or misconceived: the only respect in which he was inflexible was his
insistence on his right to refuse Sunday work.
Mr Pool’s losses have been clearly quantified and are not open to any
credible dispute. As you have seen from his statement and the bundle of
applications and rejection letters that have been disclosed, he took

immediate and vigorous action to mitigate his loss; and he secured a new
job at slightly better pay than he was earning while employed by your client
after only 15 weeks. I therefore have instructions to offer settlement of the
case for the full sum claimed on his schedule of loss, failing which I will
rely on this letter in an application to the tribunal for Mr Pool’s whole costs,
or alternatively his costs of preparing for and attending the resumed
hearing.
Yours faithfully

PRECEDENT 6.92.2: Response to a ‘without prejudice
save as to costs’ offer from the respondent
Mr Herbert has been dismissed because he refused to travel to the new
location to which his employer moved its offices. He does not dispute the
fairness of the dismissal, because his employer closed the office where he
worked when they lost the lease, and they had no other job to give him. The
dispute is about whether he is entitled to redundancy pay, so the sum at
stake is both modest and exactly quantifiable. The respondent has offered
the whole sum claimed, and has threatened a costs application if the offer is
rejected.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE SAVE AS TO COSTS
Mr Bean
David Herbert v Supaclean Ltd

Thank you for your letter of 4 September.
I am afraid that your offer of settlement ‘without admission of liability’ is
unacceptable to my client. Mr Herbert is in negotiations with his bank over
the effect of an insurance policy covering loan repayments in the event of
his dismissal for redundancy. The bank has told him that if the tribunal
finds that he was dismissed for redundancy, or if your client confirms in
writing that this was the reason for his dismissal, his repayments will be
covered for the agreed period. If the case is settled without an admission of
liability, he will not have the benefit of his insurance. Depending on how
long he is out of work, the insurance may be of considerably more value to
him than the redundancy payment which is the subject of the claim.
In the circumstances I am instructed that unless your client is willing to
admit liability, this claim cannot be settled even for payment of the full sum
claimed.
The position my client takes on this cannot be characterised as
unreasonable. He is entitled to a finding of liability, and there is a
compelling practical reason why he should insist on that entitlement. In the
circumstances I have advised him that there is no significant risk of a costs
order against him.
Yours sincerely
Natalie Cummings

Notes
1 Subject to applicable rules of professional conduct: barristers and solicitors should have regard to
their respective codes for the circumstances in which they may withdraw.
2 If this is a real possibility in a misconduct dismissal, the employer may wish to substitute a final
warning for the decision to dismiss. There is no reason why this should not be accepted in a suitable
case.
3 This example is drawn from a real case involving a security guard; the dog was important to him.

5 Note what the reference omits: it says nothing of the fact that although regular and punctual, Mr
Lightfoot’s attendance in his last two years all too often under the influence of alcohol; nor of the fact
that he was dismissed for spraying the deputy headteacher with a fire-extinguisher.

9 This illustrates the value of the ‘without prejudice’ rule: you can admit here that you have
difficulties on contributory fault to make sense of your offer, without weakening your position if the
case fights. The respondent can’t quote this to the tribunal.

7.57 Questions for witnesses

Introduction
7.1
There are basically two things that have to be done during final preparation
for a hearing. First, make sure all the written material the tribunal will need
is ready: witness statements, list of issues, chronology, bundle. The bundle
and witness statements are crucial: it is impossible to conduct a hearing
sensibly without them, and the tribunal is likely to be annoyed if they are
not ready.
7.2
The second is to prepare to conduct the hearing. There are essentially
three things you will have to do in the hearing itself:
call your own witnesses;
question the other side’s witnesses; and
make submissions – that is, tell the tribunal at the end why you ought
to win your case.

Witness statements
7.3
By the time the hearing is a few days away, the witness statements should
have been written and exchanged; see chapter 5. This is a good time to
check that you have a complete set of the latest versions of your witness
statements, and the other side’s. If the witness statements were exchanged
before the bundle was ready, you will need to insert page numbers into your
copies of the witness statements.
7.4

If there are going to be more than about half a dozen witnesses, it is
helpful if one party prepares six ring binders each containing the full set, all
in the same order – preferably the order in which the witnesses are likely to
be called.

The bundle
7.5
Once both sides have disclosed all their relevant documents, you will need
to agree the content of a hearing bundle. The point of having a single agreed
bundle is to put all the documentary evidence needed for the case in one
convenient place. This makes the hearing much easier for everyone
involved.
7.6
Preparing bundles is a tedious and time-consuming task, but it is
important. Conducting hearings is demanding and stressful at the best of
times. An ill-organised bundle adds considerably to the stress and difficulty,
and is liable to annoy the tribunal as well.

The contents of the bundle
7.7
The bundle should be contain all the documents that one side or the other
wishes the tribunal to read, but should not be any longer than necessary.
‘For completeness’ is an inadequate reason to include any document: if
there is no better reason, it should be left out. In particular, documents
should not be included in the bundle just because they have been disclosed
by one party or the other.
7.8
There will rarely be any need to include much of the pre-hearing
correspondence between the parties or their advisers. Long documents –
such as company handbooks, redundancy and redeployment policies, etc –
should, if possible, be reduced to a short relevant extract instead of being
included whole. Repetitive documents – such as time-sheets, rotas, payslips
– will sometimes need to be included at length if they need to be considered
in detail, but often a representative sample will do.
7.9

The importance of including all relevant material, while leaving out the
irrelevant, means it is unwise to delegate compiling the bundle to someone
who does not properly understand the case. This is more often done by the
respondents’ representatives: the bundle is compiled by a trainee or
paralegal who lacks the confidence to make judgements about what is and
what is not relevant and includes everything in sight rather than making
decisions. The result is a bundle running to many hundreds of pages, only a
dozen or so of which the tribunal is actually asked to read at the hearing.

Dear Mr Bean
Pauline Phelps v Gentleman, Sharpe & Co 123456/2014
I enclose a draft index for a joint bundle of documents. I suggest that we
can leave out all but a short extract of the staff handbook, as indicated, and I
do not think that it will be necessary to refer to more than one payslip as
they are the same in the relevant respects. Please let me know if you
disagree, or if there are any other documents that you would wish to see
included.
[The Law Centre is a small charity and has no secretarial backup, so it
would be very helpful if you would be willing to arrange for the bundle to
be compiled and copied, and to provide one copy to me.]
or
[Once you confirm that you are happy with the index, I will compile the
bundle and make sufficient copies for both parties and the tribunal.]

7.10
Agreeing the bundle is something that the parties or their advisers should
normally be able to handle co-operatively. Too often, however, parties
waste a good deal of time bickering about what should, or shouldn’t be in
the bundle.
7.11
Part of the reason for this is that people overestimate the significance of a
document being in the bundle. All it means is that it is a document, which at
least one party intends to show the tribunal. Agreeing that a document
should be in the bundle doesn’t mean conceding anything about its
relevance, accuracy or genuineness. If, for example, the respondent

produces a disciplinary policy they say applied to you, which you say you
never saw, it should go into the bundle. Their witnesses will need to point to
it and say ‘This was the policy.’ But you will also need to point to it to say
‘I never saw this.’
7.12
Occasionally there may be a substantive dispute about whether a
document that one side says is privileged should be included. If necessary,
this may need to be sorted out by a tribunal, either at a preliminary hearing
or at the beginning of the substantive hearing.
7.13
If, in a case where the respondent is producing the bundle, they refuse to
include some material that you believe should be in the bundle, your best
tactic is normally to attend tribunal with sufficient copies of the documents
you want included for everyone, pre-paginated and hole-punched so they
can be easily added to the existing bundle. You will need to mention this at
the beginning of the hearing to the tribunal, who will decide whether to
consider the documents. Provided the documents are relevant and were
disclosed properly to the respondent, there should be no difficulty in this.
This is also why it is pointless trying to keep out documents that the
respondent will wish to refer to if you are producing the bundle – they can
do exactly the same thing.
7.14
Sometimes respondents simply refuse to co-operate in agreeing the
bundle. In these circumstances, you should do your best to produce a
comprehensive bundle, including the documents that the respondent will
wish to refer to, yourself. This allows you to seize the moral high-ground,
ensure the tribunal’s justified irritation is directed at the respondent and
make sure the hearing can go ahead sensibly.

Creating the bundle
7.15
There are differing views about whose job it is to prepare the bundle, but
this will rarely, if ever, be worth a serious battle. It is in the interests of both
sides that it should be competently done in good time before the hearing. If
the respondents are represented by solicitors who seem to know what they

are about, it may be worthwhile trying to charm them into doing it. If the
respondents are incompetently represented, the consequence of persuading
them to do it may be an incomplete bundle, in random order and with
crucial pages either missing or illegible, and your copy not provided until
the day of the hearing. The benefit of a clear well-organised bundle which
you have had a few days to decorate with highlighters, annotations and
sticky notes before the hearing is well worth the price of some quality time
with the photocopier.
7.16
The conventional order for the bundle is the claim and response first
(plus questionnaires, requests for additional information and responses, etc),
followed by other dated documents in chronological order (starting with the
earliest), followed by any undated documents. It is probably helpful to
understand a distinction between the two main categories of papers here.
The ET1 and ET3, questionnaires, responses etc are, in effect, the paper
record of the proceedings, what used to be called ‘the pleadings’. The other
documents are the paper record of the events that are the subject of the
proceedings.
7.17
There are good reasons for this conventional order:
It allows someone to pick up the bundle and understand the case by
reading it from beginning to end. They start with the pleadings, which
summarise what each side says happened, and then proceed to the
documentary record of events. Trying to understand a case by reading
through a bundle of e-mails, letters, pay-slips, appraisal records etc.
without knowing what the central complaint is would be difficult if not
impossible.
Cross-examination tends to proceed chronologically. It is more
convenient for the witness, advocates and tribunal if reference to
documents moves smoothly through the bundle rather than jumping
about.
Documents are much easier to find in a chronological bundle.
7.18

It is very rare indeed that anything other than chronological order is a good
idea. Dividing documents by type is almost always a mistake. E-mail
correspondence often suffers from this: it is apparently tempting to place it
all at the back of the bundle under an index heading called ‘miscellaneous
e-mails’ or similar, rather than putting each e-mail in its proper
chronological place. It is obvious how this could make compiling the
bundle easier, but it is a temptation that should be resisted: it makes
conducting the hearing much harder.
7.19
Witness statements should not be included in the bundle, because the
witnesses will need to be able to be asked to turn to various different pages
in the bundle while their statement is open in front of them.
7.20
Bundles should always be paginated throughout in numerical sequence:
each page, rather than each document, should be given a number. If it is
necessary to add documents after the bundle has been compiled, they
should be inserted in their logical place and given a number and a letter –
so, for example, a four page document inserted between pages 23 and 24
should be numbered 23a, 23b, 23c and 23d. The index should be altered to
show the insertion.
7.21
There is a surprisingly large number of ways to get a bundle wrong.
Common mistakes include:
including irrelevant documents;
leaving out relevant documents;
random or erratic page numbering;
including only half of double-sided documents;
page numbers in different places on the pages;
illegible pages;
eccentric page order;
hole punching landscape documents alternately top and bottom;
broken ring binders;
inaccurate index;
including the same document more than once;
inaccurate hole-punching.

Bundles for specific purposes
7.22
Sometimes you will need separate bundles for specific purposes. For
example, there may be a preliminary hearing on a question about whether
you had sufficient continuous service to complain of unfair dismissal, or
whether the claim was presented in time. In that case, the tribunal will much
prefer to have a bundle restricted to documents (sometimes very few)
relevant to that issue only. It will often be more convenient to make a
separate bundle of documents relevant to remedies, including mitigation of
loss – especially if the mitigation bundle is extensive – and provide it to the
tribunal only after there has been a decision in the claimant’s favour on
liability. Unless the tribunal has indicated before the hearing that it will
consider remedies at a separate hearing, however, the remedy bundle should
always be ready for the main hearing day in case it is needed.
7.23
If there is to be a costs application, it will sometimes be helpful to make a
separate bundle of documents relevant to that – normally correspondence
between the parties, and possibly attendance notes recording telephone
conversations.

Video or audio evidence
7.24
Occasionally a party wants to play CCTV or audio recordings for the
tribunal. Such things are, of course, hard to put into the bundle.
7.25
The best solution to this is to reduce them to a document that can be put
in the bundle. Prepare (and agree with the respondent) a transcript of the
recording with the other side or a summary of the CCTV.
7.26
If the other side refuses to agree a sensible summary, or the evidence is
such that you really believe it has to be viewed to be appreciated, you will
have to arrange for the tribunal to view or listen to it. This should only be
done when absolutely necessary, since tribunals tend to be reluctant to view
this sort of evidence. Primarily because, if it is clear what the evidence

shows, they think the parties should be able to agree a summary or
transcript, and, if it isn’t clear, they aren’t likely to find it helpful.
7.27
If it is necessary, you will have to make arrangements to show the
evidence to the tribunal. Don’t expect the tribunal to have a television,
projector or any other sort of audio/visual equipment. If you are a litigant in
person (that is, representing yourself), you may have to resort to bringing a
laptop (borrowed if necessary) that the tribunal can huddle around. If you
are a representative, many tribunals will expect you to do rather better.

List of issues
7.28
A list of issues is a list of the questions, both factual and legal, that the
tribunal will have to answer to decide the case.
7.29
Although they are generally ordered where both parties are represented,
unlike the bundle of documents and the witness statements, the absence of a
list of issues will not usually surprise or upset the tribunal. And few
representatives leave a hearing feeling they would have won if only they
had thought to write the issues down.
7.30
Despite this, a list of issues is vital. Its absence regularly loses cases or
parts of cases. A good list of issues is the map to how the tribunal is going
to decide your case and what you need to convince them of. If you aren’t
clear about that, it will be impossible to prepare your case. How will you
know what evidence is relevant? What documents to request from the other
side? What information to include in your witness statement? What
questions to ask in cross-examination or what submissions to make?
7.31
The point is that creating such a list focuses the mind on what you are
trying to achieve and how. It is surprisingly easy to be unclear about this. It
is easy to say that a dismissal is unfair and many claimants will be able to
say something about why it is unfair. This, however, is a long way from
stating precisely what the tribunal is being asked to resolve. Without an
absolutely clear idea of what the issues are, advocacy is difficult.

7.32
This also means that an informal list of issues, written on the back of an
envelope is better than nothing. But a formal list is useful, even in a very
simple case. Without an agreed list it is easy for the tribunal and the parties
to lose track of the issues. A formal list, discussed at the beginning of the
hearing, also prevents later argument over precisely what the case is about.
7.33
But presenting a formal list of issues is not without its dangers. If you
forget to include on your list of issues something that you do in fact need
the tribunal to decide, they probably won’t decide it, and you won’t then be
able to complain about their failure to decide it.
7.34
If a formal list of issues is to be prepared, it is sensible to do so before the
hearing so that it can be agreed by the other side.

(b) the requirement from August 2013 that the claimant work in an openplan office?
(c) the requirement that she provide reception cover on a rota from

6. Would it have been a reasonable adjustment for the respondent to:
(a) assign the claimant to a specific fee-earner or fee-earners?
(b) provide an alternative to the open-plan office?
(c) remove the claimant from the receptionist pool?

Miscellaneous documents
7.35
In particular cases, there will be other documents that may be necessary or
helpful. Like the list of issues, these are often as useful to prepare as they
are to have.
7.36
It would be impossible to draw up an exhaustive list of these kinds of
documents to draft in a case: every case is different, and one of the aims of
this book is to encourage users not to assume that case preparation will
always follow the same course, and to be ready to think flexibly about what
might be needed in the particular circumstances.
7.37

With that reservation, there are some kinds of documents that are often
but not always needed. Some will be ordered by the tribunal in some cases.
In many cases it will be helpful to agree the contents with the respondent,
but if that is impossible, the next best thing will be to go to the hearing
armed with a draft. If you have come prepared with a draft chronology, for
example, and the respondent has not, then they are likely to come under
pressure from the tribunal to agree your draft. The following is a list of
some of the main possibilities.

Chronology
7.38
The tribunal will almost certainly be helped by a chronology – that is, a list
of the main events in the case in date order, showing their dates – if the
parties have time to prepare it. If the story is so long and complicated that a
full chronology runs to several pages, it may be helpful to prepare a onepage outline chronology as well.
7.39
Preparing a chronology is an extremely good way of getting to grips with
a difficult and complicated case. Many lawyers produce one as a matter of
course for just this reason. This means any kind offers from the other side to
prepare a neutral chronology for agreement should be treated much as your
mother taught you to regard offers of sweets from strangers: the side that
has done this piece of work is likely to be at an advantage in general
familiarity with the case. If you can commit a short outline chronology to
memory without spending too much time on it, so much the better.

Cast list
7.40
If there are a lot of different individuals involved in the story, a list of them
showing briefly how they fit into the picture will assist.

List of essential reading
7.41
If the case is particularly document-heavy, then it is a good idea to agree a
list of the most important documents for the tribunal to read at the

beginning of the hearing, and to invite them to set aside a day or half a day
for this purpose.

7.42
If the tribunal will have to understand technical terms, or if the story
involves a large number of organisations or departments familiarly referred
to by their initials, the tribunal will be helped by a glossary.

Diagrams or sketches
7.43
If the employer’s organisational structure is at all important, a diagram
showing this structure (often called an ‘organogram’) will be useful. If the
layout of a room or building matters, an agreed plan or sketch may assist.

‘Scott schedules’
7.44
Tribunals will sometimes talk about a ‘schedule of issues’, by which they
probably just mean a list of issues. But in more complicated cases, they may
want to see a document that summarises both (or all) parties’ key
contentions in the form of a table. This is sometimes called a ‘Scott
schedule’. For example, in a long discrimination case involving a lot of
separate allegations, it may be helpful to agree a Scott schedule with
columns for a brief description of the allegation, whether the date of the
incident, whether the respondent says that the claim is out of time in
relation to that incident, if so on what basis the claimant says the tribunal
has jurisdiction, which individual respondents are involved and so on.

Preparing to conduct the hearing
7.45
Different advocates prepare to conduct a hearing in different ways. The
suggestions here are just one way of many, but beginners and non-lawyers
may find it helpful to have a recipe to follow until they have found out what
works best for them.

Observing a hearing
7.46
If you are completely new to the process, go to the tribunal and sit in on
someone else’s case. This will help in various ways. First, although lawyers
often speak of tribunal hearings as ‘informal’, if you are not used to legal
proceedings, a tribunal hearing is likely to be by some distance the most
formal meeting you have ever taken part in. This is quite stressful:
observing another case before you do your own will at least take the edge of
complete unfamiliarity off proceedings.
7.47
Observing a case will also give you a better idea what you are trying to
achieve when you prepare your own than any explanation could. Try to see
a case where at least one side is professionally represented, so that you can
observe cross-examination and submissions done by someone who does
these things for a living.
7.48
Tribunal hearings are normally public: anyone can go and sit at the back
at (almost) any hearing for as much or as little of the hearing as they wish.
Tribunal clerks or judges do occasionally quiz those present about who they
are and what their role is. But if you want to observe a case, you should not
be put off by this, or made to feel that you have to identify, explain or
justify yourself if you don’t want to. It should be perfectly adequate to say
‘I’m a member of the public here to watch the tribunal at work.’

Getting familiar with the documents
7.49
If you are the claimant, or if you advised the claimant from an early stage,
by the time the hearing is close you will probably know the documents
pretty well already. If you are brought in at a fairly late stage – as barristers
often are – just to do the advocacy, you will start with no knowledge of any
of the documents. In a way, that makes the task simpler: you just have to
read everything, probably several times. But even if you are the claimant
and already know (or think you know) the documents quite well, it is a
good idea to try to proceed at this point as if the case was new to you.
7.50

Set yourself up in a quiet room with all the papers on a decent-sized desk
or table. Equip yourself with a couple of highlighters, a pen, a pad of sticky
notes – or several, in different colours – and either a notebook or a
computer.
7.51
Work your way methodically through the papers, probably starting with
the pleadings (the ET1 and the ET3 and any requests for additional
information and replies to those requests), then going on to the witness
statements, and finally the bundle. Highlight anything you think important.
You may want to highlight everything you think at all important in one
colour, and then underline the bits you think really important in another.
Stick a sticky note on any document you think particularly significant; you
may want to write brief labels on the sticky notes, or colourcode them in
some way. Cross-reference the statements and the bundle: so, for instance,
if you think paragraph 23 of Mr Sharpe’s witness statement is inconsistent
with something on page 47 of the bundle, annotate both so that you
remember.
7.52
At the same time as you are doing this, start to create three documents: a
chronology, a set of written submissions (based on your list of issues), and a
set of questions for witnesses. So when you notice the inconsistency
between paragraph 23 of Mr Sharpe’s witness statement and page 47 of the
bundle, make that point in your draft submissions; and write down some
questions to ask Mr Sharpe about it. If you are an adviser and you come
across material that you don’t understand, make a note to ask your client
about it. Each time you turn a page, you will probably find another date to
put in your chronology. Don’t worry early on in the process about the order
you put material into your written submissions and cross-examination
notes: you can sort that out later. An Excel spreadsheet or a table in Word
will make writing the chronology easier, because you will be able to write
the dates down in any order and then sort them automatically into date order
at the end.
7.53
By the time you have got to the end of your bundle of documents this
way, you should have a complete chronology of the case, quite a lot of
questions for witnesses, and the beginnings of some written submissions.

The next thing is probably to organise your questions for the witnesses.
Think about which question is for which witness. Decide what order you
want to ask your questions in. Put in headings for each topic you want to
ask a witness about. Add cross-references to the pages in the bundle you
want to ask the witnesses about. You will probably find yourself turning to
the bundle to check details and page numbers, and noticing further relevant
details in it as you do this. Keep your list of issues to hand, and make sure
your questions for the other side’s witnesses cover all of them.
7.54
Once you have finished this – or when you want a change – turn to your
written submissions, filling in gaps, adding headings or structure, editing
out repetition and so on. In the course of this process you will probably
think of more questions you want to ask, so add those into your list of
questions for witnesses as you go along.
7.55
There is no quick way of preparing a case. This process will take several
hours even for a one-day case. If your case is listed for several days, and the
bundle runs to three or four lever-arch files or more, you can expect to
spend many hours working through the papers and gradually refining your
cross-examination notes and your draft submissions. But by the time you
have finished, you should have a detailed chronology of the case, a first
draft of your submissions, and a list of questions for witnesses.
7.56
You should also have become thoroughly familiar in the process with all
the statements on both sides, and with all the relevant documents. In some
ways preparing for a hearing is like revising for an exam: it is necessary to
know the material well enough to realise at once when a witness has said
something that is inconsistent with his own statement, or with the statement
of another witness on the same side, or with one of the documents in the
bundle.

Introduction
8.1
This chapter tells you about the structure and practicalities of the hearing;
the following chapter gives some guidance about advocacy.

Arriving at tribunal
8.2

It is important to be on time. Tribunals have busy schedules, and arriving
late will start things off on the wrong foot. Make sure that you know exactly
how to get to the tribunal and have considered anything (parking, train
times, etc) that might affect your journey.
8.3
Aim to arrive about an hour early. As well as allowing for delays, this
means you can get settled and take a few deep breaths before the tribunal
starts. It also allows for a talk with the other side, which is useful for sorting
out any outstanding practical details, exchanging or agreeing chronologies
or lists of issues, etc. Time may also be needed for settlement negotiations.
8.4
It is worth having a checklist of what you will need to take to the
tribunal. Make sure you have:
your own marked copy of the bundle of documents;
if you are bringing the bundles, four clean copies: three for the tribunal
and one for the witness table (if the judge is sitting alone, you only
need two copies);
at least six copies of each witness statement: one for the representative,
three for the tribunal, one for the witness table and at least one for the
use of the public;
a copy of any relevant legislation (ideally the current edition of
Butterworths Employment Law Handbook (Lexis Nexis), which the
tribunal will have);
five copies of any authorities (ie copies of previously decided cases)
relied on: one for you, three for the tribunal, one for the other side;
notebooks, post-its, pens and highlighters;
a calculator; and
a diary (for agreeing future hearing dates).

The hearing room
8.5
Hearing rooms vary in size, but are laid out in a conventional way. The
tribunal members sit facing the rest of the room, usually on a slightly raised
platform, behind a long desk. There will be desks facing them at the front of

the room for the parties and their representatives, with room for at least two
people to sit on each side. The claimant and her representative sit on the
right hand side of the room facing the tribunal, and the respondents and
their representative sit on the left. There are usually one or two rows of
chairs behind the parties for members of the public and the press, etc.
Between the parties’ desks and the tribunal there is a table and chair for the
witness who is giving evidence at any given time; opposite that on the other
side of the room, there may be a table for a member of tribunal staff. If the
parties are represented, it is usual for the representatives to sit on the inside
of their respective desks, with their clients nearer the walls. This is because
there may be occasions when the representatives need to speak to each
other in the course of the hearing.

Formalities
Forms of address
8.6
The judge is addressed as ‘Madam’ or ‘Sir’ as appropriate. This also applies
to the lay members if you address them directly. When addressing the
tribunal as a whole, you just use the form of address appropriate to the
judge (because you address the panel through the judge – much like a very
formally chaired meeting). If you want to refer to one of the lay members in
the third person – in order to remind them when you are making your
submissions of a question they asked of one of the witnesses, for example –
you will need their name. So it is a good idea to look at the hearing list on
arrival at the tribunal and take a note of the lay members’ names.1
8.7
Everyone remains seated, except witnesses while they are being sworn.
While a witness is being sworn, everyone else in the room should remain
still and silent. Some tribunals will be very annoyed if there is any fidgeting
with papers or whispering at this point.
8.8
Barristers sometimes refer to their opponents as ‘my learned friend’ in
the hearing. Traditionally, only barristers are allowed to have learned

friends: anyone else using the expression may cause a slight wince. ‘My
colleague’ or just ‘Miss Fanshawe’ is preferable in any event.

What to wear
8.9
There is no dress code for the tribunal. (Although it is vital you wear
something.)
8.10
Nevertheless, hearings are formal events and it is sensible for both
claimants and representatives to dress accordingly. No tribunal is likely to
decide against a claimant because he’s wearing a t-shirt or because his
adviser isn’t wearing a tie. But hearings are partly about how the parties
come across. Human nature being what it is, dress will be a part of this. It is
likely to be a small part, but there is no need to give away points on a small
issue. This applies equally to representatives as to parties.
8.11
So smart and reasonably subdued dress is recommended. If you do not
normally wear a suit on smart occasions, what you would wear to a job
interview is probably about right. Representatives should wear a dark suit.
If you do wear a suit, it is usual to keep the jacket on through the hearing.

The shape of the hearing
8.12
Employment tribunals have a wide power to regulate their own procedure,
but there is a conventional order in which hearings are usually taken. The
employment judge will normally introduce herself and her lay members,
and then either state what she considers the issues to be, or ask the parties to
clarify what they think the issues are.
8.13
After that, unless either party has any preliminary application to make
(for an adjournment, for example, or for further disclosure, or for the other
party’s claim or response to be struck out), the hearing will normally
proceed as follows:
tribunal reads witness statements

then either:
claimant calls her first witnesses
respondent cross-examines
claimant calls her second witness
respondent cross-examines
... and so on until all the claimant’s witnesses have given evidence
respondent calls its first witnesses
claimant cross-examines
respondent calls its second witness
claimant cross-examines
... and so on until all the respondent’s witnesses have given evidence
respondent makes closing submissions
claimant makes closing submissions
or:
respondent calls its first witness
claimant cross-examines
respondent calls its second witness
claimant cross-examines
...
claimant calls her first witness
respondent cross-examines
claimant calls her second witness
respondent cross-examines
...
claimant makes closing submissions
respondent makes closing submissions
8.14
The choice between these two possibilities usually depends on which side
has something to prove first. In a discrimination case, the claimant cannot
succeed without showing discrimination, so the claimant calls her witnesses
first. In an unfair dismissal case (if dismissal is admitted), the employer has
to start by showing that it had an acceptable reason for the dismissal – if it
fails, the dismissal was unfair without further argument. So in that case, the
employer starts. In a constructive dismissal case, the claimant has to start by

showing that she was dismissed, so the claimant starts. Tribunals do not
always follow these rules, so it is important to be prepared.
8.15
Often there are cases where it is hard to say exactly how this rule should
apply – for example, where the claimant is complaining of both unfair
dismissal and discrimination. It is not worth getting bogged down in this
question. It is worthwhile to know the conventions, so that whoever starts,
you know what is likely to happen next and aren’t taken by surprise. But,
particularly in a long case, it is important not to place too much reliance on
a prediction about the order in which the tribunal will take the case.
Example
In a case about sex discrimination and unfair dismissal, the claimant takes
the view that the main complaint is sex discrimination and she will
therefore give her evidence first. The case is listed for five days. She
estimates that her own evidence (with cross-examination) will take at least a
day and a half. The respondent is calling four witnesses, one being the
decision-maker – clearly its main witness. The claimant expects her
evidence will therefore take up the first day and a half of the hearing. By
day one of the hearing she has started but not finished preparing to crossexamine the respondent’s main witness, and she has no cross examination
notes at all for the respondent’s other three witnesses.
The tribunal decides that as the case is about dismissal, it wants to hear
from the respondent first. The respondent decides to call its minor witnesses
first so that they can be released at the end of day one.
This sequence of events is a serious blow to the claimant, who was not
expecting to cross-examine these witnesses until day three at least and
hasn’t prepared. If she applies for an adjournment on this basis, she is most
unlikely to get it. Even if she does, she may be ordered to pay the
respondent’s costs thrown away by the adjournment. On the other hand, if
the hearing is not adjourned, she has to cross-examine ‘cold’.
8.16

This shape applies to all hearings in the tribunal, not just merits hearings.
There will be a general discussion to establish the issues, followed by
evidence and then submissions. Exactly the same will happen in a costs
hearing or at a reconsideration. The issues, and therefore the relevant
evidence and submissions, change, but the basic structure of the hearing
stays the same.

Opening statements
8.17
Occasionally one party or the other wishes to make an opening statement to
the tribunal before the evidence begins. This is the exception rather than the
rule and tribunals tend to be resistant to the idea. The purpose of an opening
statement, if any, will be to ensure that the tribunal knows what the issues
are it will have to decide, focus its attention on what it should be looking
for in the evidence, and give it a framework for understanding what it hears.
8.18
One reason that tribunals are resistant to opening statements is that, in
most cases, the process of establishing the list of issues will do this
adequately.
8.19
Long opening statements will normally be strongly discouraged.

Reading time for the tribunal
8.20
Tribunals do not routinely read bundles of documents and witness
statements before the hearing. In most cases they will have read the ET1
and the ET3 on the morning of the first day, but not much more.
8.21
In most cases, once the issues have been established, the tribunal will
pause to read all of the witness statements, before the witnesses start to give
evidence. Generally they will read the most important documents at the
same time.
8.22

It’s useful to have decided what documents, if any, you would like the
tribunal to read at this stage. In a complicated case with lots of documents it
can be helpful to agree a reading list with the other side.
8.23
If the case is long enough to justify it – probably six or seven days at
least – the pre-reading may take a whole day. If that is likely, it’s sensible to
try to agree this with the other party and the tribunal at a directions hearing,
or in correspondence before the hearing starts. Otherwise everyone will turn
up on the first day of the hearing only to be sent away until the next day
while the tribunal does its homework.

Claimants with special needs
8.24
The tribunal should be willing to adjust its practices to take account of the
special needs of parties. It has a duty to make reasonable adjustments for
those with disabilities. If any adjustments are needed, a request should be
made in writing, or at a case management discussion. The following is a list
of the kinds of adjustments that might be requested, but claimants should be
ready to ask for whatever meets their own specific needs:
sign language interpreters;
rest breaks;
to be given extra time to take notes;
to have a friend or support worker sit by them when they give
evidence;
opportunity to get up and move around;
additional hearing days (where other arrangements mean the hearing
will be slower than usual);
modified lighting;
to be allowed to use a Braille machine or laptop with speech output;
to be accompanied by a guide dog or other assistance animal;
a less formal physical environment – for example, to have the hearing
with the tribunal members and parties sitting around a large table
instead of in a normal hearing room;

to have repetitive or hostile questioning strictly controlled, or
questions relayed through the judge;
to have the use of a microphone and amplification when they give their
evidence.
8.25
If the tribunal does not grant a request, it is possible to appeal to the EAT.
Such an appeal should be approached cautiously, since it is likely to delay
proceedings and, regardless of the outcome, may influence the tribunal
negatively.

Taking notes at the hearing
8.26
It is useful to take good notes of the employment tribunal proceedings for
two reasons. The first is to assist with the conduct of the hearing itself: it
may be necessary to put to a witness something that she has said earlier, or
to refer to what a witness said under cross-examination in closing
submissions. The impact of this may be damaged or destroyed if you don’t
have a reasonably accurate note of what was said. The second is that the
evidence that was given at first instance may be important when it comes to
an appeal.
8.27
Taking good notes while conducting a case in the employment tribunal is
difficult. If the respondent is represented by a barrister, there will often be
someone from the respondent’s solicitors at the hearing to take notes. The
claimant may not be so lucky: voluntary sector advice agencies, in
particular, will almost never be able to spare two lawyers to attend a
hearing. If there is a representative, she should aim to take notes of the most
important things that are said, but priority obviously has to be given to
conducting the proceedings, not recording them. Taking good notes of your
own cross-examination is particularly difficult. The claimant herself may be
able to take notes, but is likely to be preoccupied, so if possible it is better
to have a friend, relative or colleague present to do so.
8.28

It is worthwhile giving some thought to this before the hearing. If you are
going to rely on someone who isn’t used to taking notes, make sure the
note-taker has a suitable notebook and pens, and knows what it is most
important for her to record. The task is tiring, especially for someone who is
inexperienced, so it will often be sensible to ask the note-taker to take the
best notes she possibly can of your cross-examination of the respondent’s
witnesses plus the answers to any additional questions from the tribunal, but
otherwise only to write down anything she considers particularly important.

Evidence
Definitions: evidence in chief, cross-examination, reexamination and leading questions
8.29
Four technical terms are needed first. Evidence in chief is the evidence
given by a witness in her own statement or under questioning by the
advocate on her side; examination in chief is asking questions of your own
witness. Cross-examination is the questioning of a witness by the other
party’s advocate. After a witness has been cross-examined, the party who
called her is entitled to put further questions, called re-examination.
8.30
Leading questions are questions that indicate the expected answer: ‘Did
Mr Smith then hit you on the head with a blue ring binder?’ is a leading
question, and the addition of the words ‘or not?’ on the end does not alter
that. ‘What happened next?’ is not.
8.31
A good rule of thumb is that a leading question can be answered by
replying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – or by selecting from one of the options given by the
questioner. For example, ‘Was the folder red or blue?’ is leading, while
‘What colour was the folder?’ is not.
8.32
Leading questions are strongly discouraged in examination-in-chief and
re-examination. This is because the impact of a witness meekly agreeing
with statements made by the lawyer or her own side is much less than
impact of an account given in her own words. In cross-examination, leading

questions are essential, and will not be discouraged: for example ‘You
didn’t look at the claimant’s personnel file before deciding to dismiss him,
did you?’
8.33
None of these terms is defined or used in the employment tribunal rules
of procedure. All are concepts borrowed from the ordinary courts. They are
widely used in the employment tribunals nevertheless, and they are such
fundamental concepts for trained lawyers that tribunals will often seem
oblivious to the fact that they may be new to parties acting in person or to
inexperienced lay advisers.

Calling your own witnesses
8.34
You will generally be expected to introduce your witnesses and get them
started. If you are a litigant in person, when you give evidence, the tribunal
will ask you similar questions.
8.35
Start by saying something like:
‘My first [/next] witness is Mr Smith. Mr Smith would you come to the
witness table?’
8.36
Mr Smith will then be sworn by the tribunal and sit down at the witness
table. There is no set way of beginning, but the following is fairly typical:
‘If you look in front of you, you should find a statement with your name
on it, is this your witness statement?’
‘Please look at the last page of the statement, is that your signature?’
‘Is this statement true to the best of your knowledge and belief?’
If you have any supplementary questions for the witness, this is time to ask
them. Otherwise:
‘Thank you, Mr Smith. If you could stay there, Mr Jones [the
respondent’s lawyer] will have some questions for you.’
8.37

When your own witness is being cross-examined, don’t interrupt unless it is
essential. The judge should intervene if she considers the line of
questioning irrelevant or the manner inappropriate. If she has not done so of
her own accord, that probably means that she considers the questions
proper. If you think your witness is being bullied, but the judge is doing
nothing, then it may be right to intervene. Catching the judge’s eye may be
enough – and is definitely worth trying first.
8.38
If it’s really necessary to intervene, apologise for the interruption and ask
the judge to restrain the line of questioning. Don’t on any account shout
‘Objection!’ – that may happen in American TV dramas (and courtrooms);
but its effect in an employment tribunal will be somewhere – depending on
the judge – between fingernails on a blackboard, and a red rag to a bull.

Cross-examination
8.39
In a case with multiple claimants or respondents, all parties will have an
opportunity to cross-examine all the other parties’ witnesses. In practice,
one party will normally end up doing most of the cross-examination.
8.40
Cross-examination is covered in chapter 9: see para 9.35 onwards.

Re-examination
8.41
Once a witness has been cross-examined, the other side has the opportunity
to re-examine. Re-examination must relate to the cross-examination, and as
for examination-in-chief, leading questions are firmly discouraged. On
when and how to re-examine, see para 9.57 below.

Tribunal questions
8.42
The tribunal is also likely to ask the witnesses questions. Practice on this
varies; some tribunals will break into the parties’ questioning, others will
wait to the end.
8.43

It is worth paying close attention to the tribunal members’ questions.
They can provide useful insights into how they are thinking and what they
consider important.

Submissions
8.44
After the witnesses have given their evidence, each side has an opportunity
to make submissions to the tribunal: in other words, to make a speech to the
tribunal seeking to persuade it to find one way or the other. Submissions are
sometimes made orally; sometimes in writing; and sometimes both. You
don’t have to make submissions: you may feel that you have made all the
points that you want to in the course of your evidence and crossexamination.
8.45
There is advice about how to approach submissions at para 9.59 below.

What can go wrong at the hearing
8.46
Hearings are unpredictable and all kinds of things can go wrong on the day.
What follows is a list of some of the most common problems that can crop
up, with suggestions as to how they might be handled.

The respondent comes to the hearing with a large pile of
documents that you have not seen before
8.47
This is fairly common. You will have to make a fairly swift decision about
how important the new documents are. It may be sufficient to ask the
tribunal for a short break of 20 minutes to half an hour so that you can read
the new documents and consider them. If they are particularly important, or
you will have difficulty in analysing them in a short time, then it may be
necessary to ask the tribunal to adjourn the hearing to another day. If this is
necessary, consider making an application for a costs or preparation time
order.
8.48

Alternatively, you may simply wish to ask the tribunal to exclude the new
material from its consideration on the grounds that it should have been
disclosed earlier. Either way, stress should be laid on the respondent’s
failure to comply properly with whatever order was previously made about
disclosure of documents.

The respondent makes new allegations at the hearing
that the claimant was not previously aware of but could
refute given time
8.49
This is a variation on the previous example. Again, if the new material is
important enough, it may be necessary to request a postponement.

Someone fails to turn up
8.50
When the tribunal is due to start, representatives may find themselves
without clients; clients may be missing their representative; or both may be
looking for a witness. The only thing to be done in these circumstances is to
try to find out what has happened and tell the clerk, who will inform the
tribunal.
8.51
If there is substantial delay, the tribunal is likely to call the parties in to
ask for an explanation. At this point, the tribunal will have three choices:
wait for the missing individual to arrive; postpone the hearing or hear the
case without them. The choice will depend on the circumstances and how
much the tribunal knows.
8.52
If the missing person is on your side, your priority will normally be to
avoid the case continuing without him. A claim where the claimant does not
appear is unlikely to win. And a claimant finding himself without
representation at the last minute is unlikely to do his claim justice.
8.53
The best argument will always be a good reason for the failure to attend.
If you have no information about this, all you can do is emphasise the
prejudice to your client of allowing the hearing to go ahead. If the claimant

has previously conducted the proceedings properly, point that out. Point out
too that the only prejudice to the respondent is the inconvenience and
expense of coming back another day; this is much less than the prejudice to
the claimant in having the hearing go ahead without his evidence, and can,
if appropriate, be compensated by costs.
8.54
If you are the claimant and your representative has failed to turn up, you
will almost certainly want to resist any suggestion that you should represent
yourself. It is true that the tribunals are very used to hearing from
unrepresented parties, but point out if necessary that it is one thing to
represent yourself when you have had a chance to prepare. It is quite
another to do so having relied on somebody else to represent you.
8.55
If you are the one who has had problems reaching the tribunal it is
important to let your client or representative, as the case may be, know as
soon as possible. If you have difficulty reaching them, or are representing
yourself, call the tribunal directly. This should be done as soon as it seems
likely you will be late. It is better to ring early, saying that you might be
late, but then arrive on time, than to ring after the tribunal is already
wondering where you are.

The tribunal is not prepared to go ahead
8.56
This is more common than it should be. Tribunal hearings are over-booked.
On any given day more cases are due to take place than there are tribunals
to hear them. This is because many cases settle and so drop out of the list.
The aim is to judge the number of hearings scheduled so that, on the day,
just enough have settled to allow the others to be heard. Sometimes the
tribunal guesses wrong and is caught short. If when you get to the tribunal it
turns out that your case has not been allocated to a particular tribunal, it is
described as ‘floating’: that is, waiting in case a tribunal becomes free to
hear it in the course of the day. Sometimes if you are unallocated you will
get to start your case later in the day; if you are unlucky, you will wait
around for half the day and then be sent home. This is frustrating and timewasting for the parties, but there is nothing to be done about it.

Occasionally the tribunal service will call the parties the day before the
hearing to say that the hearing will not go ahead.

One of your witness appears, under cross-examination,
to be untruthful
8.57
First, try very hard to remain poker-faced. Looking appalled, shaking your
head, tut-tutting etc. will draw additional attention to damaging material.
Later, if necessary, you can do your best to play down the importance of the
witness or the particular piece of evidence in submissions. Resist the
temptation to blame yourself if this happens: if your client has founded her
claim on lies and is found out, she will lose – and she will deserve to lose.
Your job is to put the case to the tribunal in its best possible light, according
to what your client has told you. Much of what will happen at the tribunal is
determined by the people concerned and the history of the case. Both were
determined long before you got involved.
8.58
Bear in mind, too, that a lot of the evidence given will not in fact be very
relevant to anything the tribunal has to decide. The fact that one of your
witnesses has given what seems to be untrustworthy evidence in one respect
does not mean that none of their evidence can be believed. Witnesses very
often ‘spin’ their evidence a bit. This is not a good thing, but it is not the
end of the world, either, if their evidence is convincing where it matters
more.

The hearing proceeds in an unexpected order
8.59
It may be that you have assumed that your side will give evidence first, and
the tribunal decides it wants to hear from the respondent’s witnesses first; or
it may be that the respondent’s representative calls his witnesses in a
surprising order; or just that some of the evidence goes faster than you had
expected.
8.60
None of this will matter much, as long as you have started the hearing
ready to cross-examine all of the other side’s witnesses. But if you are

under pressure in a long case, you may have postponed some of your
preparation until after the first couple of days. If so, you may suddenly find
yourself expected to cross-examine a witness you are not well-prepared for.
8.61
You may just have to cross-examine ‘on the hoof’ as best you can. If it is
a major witness and you are seriously unprepared, then if you are
representing yourself, it may be worth explaining the problem to the judge
and asking for the hearing to be taken in a different order, or even adjourned
to the next day. Much will depend on the time available and how the
hearing is proceeding: if it’s three o’clock in the afternoon of day four of
10, and it’s already looking as if the evidence will be completed by the end
of day five even with an early adjournment on day four, you will probably
get away with it. If the hearing is going slowly and this request is likely to
make the difference between whether or not the case finishes in the time
allotted, it will be much more difficult – and even if you get your
adjournment, there may be a risk of costs.

The judge treats you or your client with hostility
8.62
If this happens, accurate and complete note-taking becomes particularly
important. If the judge (or a member) of the tribunal says something that
indicates hostility, write it down at once. If someone else is taking notes for
you, make sure they note it.
8.63
As well as taking notes, you should consider whether to make an
application for the judge to remove himself from the case because of
apparent bias. This is a tactic that has a high cost, and should not be used
lightly. It will certainly antagonise the tribunal, so unless they grant the
application, it will – anyway in the short term – make a bad situation worse.
It is therefore a tactic that has more to do with laying the foundations for a
subsequent appeal than with winning the case this time round. If granted, it
will almost certainly cause an adjournment.

The judge refuses to permit the claimant to crossexamine in an important area

8.64
The tribunal has a general power to control proceedings, and will
sometimes restrain a particular line of cross-examination on the grounds
that it is not relevant. It may be necessary to explain where the questions are
heading or why they are relevant. Unfortunately this will sometimes lose
what would have been a useful element of surprise. If the tribunal is
determined to restrain a series of questions that the claimant regards as
crucial, make careful notes of this exchange in case it needs to form the
basis of a subsequent appeal.

The judge imposes strict time limits on crossexamination or submissions
8.65
This is becoming more and more common with increasing pressure on
tribunals to deal with cases quickly. Tribunals sometimes ask for estimates
of how long each stage will take, and then hold parties to their estimates.
This is particularly unfair in the case of an unrepresented claimant, because
it takes experience to estimate how long cross-examination will take. In any
event, much depends on the manner in which the witness answers
questions: a witness who gives terse one- or two-word answers will finish
her evidence much faster than a witness who tells a long rambling story in
answer to each question. If you feel that you are being seriously
disadvantaged by time limits, you should put up a fight at the time: outline
briefly what remains to be covered and why it is important. It may be
helpful to refer the tribunal to rule 2 (Overriding objective) and point out
that the need to deal with cases justly comes first, and trumps (if necessary)
the aim of dealing with them ‘expeditiously’.

You forget to ask one of the respondent’s witnesses
about a crucial topic
8.66
This is easily done. If the witness is still present, it should not be too
difficult to remedy. Explain the omission to the tribunal, and ask for the
witness to be recalled. Although the tribunal will not be best pleased, it
should normally agree, especially if you are representing yourself. If the

witness was released on a previous day and is no longer attending the
hearing, the tribunal is likely to be more reluctant, but if the omitted topic is
important enough it may be necessary to make the request anyway. Thought
should be given to whether this will extend proceedings enough to
necessitate an extra hearing day: if it does, there will be a real risk of a costs
order.

You realise you don’t have enough copies of a witness
statement, schedule of loss etc
8.67
Occasionally, you can charm the tribunal staff into photocopying
something, but they are not really supposed to, so do not be offended if they
say no. They will be able to direct you to the nearest copy shop.
8.68
It is also worth asking the other side, particularly if they are represented.
Many lawyers will bring a few spare copies of key documents ‘just in case’.

Notes

Introduction
9.1
Advocacy is the art of persuading the tribunal to do what you want. Good
advocacy convinces the tribunal you are right about the facts and the law –
leading them to find in your favour. Bad advocacy doesn’t.
9.2
This is easy to say, but it’s difficult to explain how to be a good advocate
in a way that is helpful to someone doing it for the first time. Attempts to do
so have a tendency to descend into truisms: a good advocate is
comprehensive, yet concise; a good advocate controls the witness during
cross-examination; a good advocate doesn’t take bad points. All of this is
true. But it doesn’t really help someone who has to appear before a tribunal
for the first time.
9.3
Advocacy is also simply difficult. The authors have between them spent
many years trying to master it – neither of us would claim to have done so.
9.4
Partly, the subject is difficult because there are many different styles of
good advocacy. Different people approach advocacy in different ways. One
of the easiest differences to spot is between ‘nice’ and ‘nasty’ advocacy:
some barristers will cross-examine in a way that makes you feel you’ve
been savaged by a Rottweiler; others will do it so gently you may forget
they’re on the other side. Both approaches can work well; both can misfire.
‘Nice’ advocacy creates less risk of alienating the tribunal – and is
generally less stressful for everyone – so it’s what we both aspire to and
recommend. But to some extent, once you are past the basics, you will need

to find your own way. Attempting to force yourself to adopt a style that
you’re uncomfortable with is likely to fail.
9.5
Don’t take any of this as too discouraging. The basics of advocacy aren’t
insurmountably difficult or mysterious. Advocacy is something that tends to
by mythologised – not least by lawyers. A little preparation and thought
will take you a long way.
9.6
Bear in mind that advocacy and the standard of advocacy is rarely the
main deciding factor in a case. Most cases resolve themselves on the
evidence and the law – and will come out much the same way regardless. If
one side has a significantly strong case, there is little that the advocate on
the other side can do, regardless of their ability. Occasionally, of course,
good advocacy will rescue a seemingly hopeless case, by exposing a lying
witness or convincing a sceptical judge. But it’s the exception rather than
the rule.
9.7
In this chapter, we try to set out a general approach and give some basic
advice. It owes a great deal to our own approach to tribunal advocacy – but
is also aimed at advising beginners.

Some book recommendations
9.8
Advocacy is a sufficiently large subject that it’s impossible to do justice to
it in a chapter of a general book. If you intended to appear in tribunals
regularly, it’s well worth seeking out more material.
9.9
The best introduction to general court advocacy is Advocacy in court: a
beginner’s guide by Keith Evans.1 Although it is primarily aimed at
criminal barristers, it is full of good, common sense advice that applies to
any court or tribunal setting (and the specific material on criminal trials is
easy to ignore or adjust).
9.10
For a more advanced view, read The art of the advocate by Richard du
Cann.2 Also useful is The devil’s advocate by Iain Morley QC.3

A game of two halves
9.11
Tribunal advocacy can be conveniently divided into two halves: witness
handling and submissions. Witness handling means getting evidence from
the witnesses – primarily through cross-examination. Submissions means
persuading the tribunal once evidence has finished, through closing oral
submissions and written submissions.

A third half
9.12
But it’s also worth remembering that almost everything you do in the
context of a tribunal case can contribute to the persuasion, or not, of the
tribunal.
9.13
For example, one of the reasons we suggest taking a pragmatic and,
where appropriate, conciliatory approach to case preparation is that doing
so will make you look reasonable – or at least avoid the reverse. If the
tribunal has to spend the first 15 minutes of the hearing listening to you
making trivial complaints about the respondent, they’re more likely to start
the case with a bad impression of you than the other side.
9.14
Similarly, some litigants do real damage to their case by living up to the
other side’s expectations of them. If you’ve been dismissed for persistent
lateness, it’s a particularly bad idea to turn up at the tribunal an hour after
the hearing was due to begin. A manager accused of losing his temper in a
disciplinary hearing won’t help his case if he becomes belligerent during
cross-examination.
9.15
Maintaining a calm, measured and reasonable approach throughout the
tribunal proceedings (and particularly during the hearing) is almost always
a good idea.

Three guiding principles

Identify and focus on the issues
9.16
The tribunal’s job is to apply the relevant law to the facts of the case. This
means that in almost all cases the tribunal’s approach to the case will be
rather strictly defined by the law. They need to answer the questions that the
law tells them to answer.
9.17
This means that advocacy has to be directed at the issues that the tribunal
has to address. It’s easy to lose sight of this in the emotion and heat of a
tribunal hearing. That’s especially true if you’re dealing with your own
case.
9.18
The most common example of this is approaching an unfair dismissal
claim by attempting to prove that you didn’t commit the misconduct you
were accused of. This is simply not the right legal test. The tribunal needs
to decide whether your employer genuinely believed you committed the
misconduct, whether they had reasonable grounds for that belief and
whether dismissal for that alleged misconduct was within the reasonable
range of responses for the employer (and whether a fair procedure was
followed to dismiss). Trying to convince them that you didn’t do it is
therefore worse than futile. Even if you succeed, it won’t mean you win. At
the same time, you will waste time that should be spent on the real issues
and annoy the tribunal.
9.19
This is practical advice about how to maximise your chances of winning
tribunal claims, not an endorsement of employment law. You may think the
test for unfair dismissal should be different – you may even be right. But
the tribunal will apply the law as it is, not as it ought to be.
9.20
All of this means it’s important to identify the relevant issues in any case
as early as possible and then focus clearly on them throughout the hearing.
A good general rule is that if, at any point during the hearing, the judge
were to stop you to ask ‘Why is what you’re talking about relevant ...’ you
should be able to reply ‘It’s relevant to [issue], because ...’. If you can’t,
why are you talking about it?

9.21
Identifying the issues also means identifying the best issues to fight the
case on. In general, it is better to pick a small number of good points to
argue a case on, rather than argue everything and the kitchen sink. For
example, in most unfair dismissal cases there a few key reasons why
dismissal might have been unfair. Then there are a few things that might be
criticised, but aren’t really very significant. Finally, there are lots of things
that a clever lawyer or an emotionally engaged litigant could argue were
unfair – but really probably weren’t. Focusing on the best points is likely to
be much more effective than running every possible point.
9.22
This means that an important part of advocacy is identifying the best
points and then sticking to them. This isn’t easy and it takes confidence. But
bad points can easily undermine an otherwise strong case. They crowd out
good points, by using up time and attention that would be better spent
elsewhere. They also make good points look worse. A tribunal presented
with bad arguments tends to lose faith in the good ones as well.

Concentrate on being understood by the tribunal
9.23
The first and most important task of an advocate is to be understood. If the
tribunal doesn’t understand what you’re saying, it will be impossible to
convince them of anything. So present your case as straightforwardly and
simply as possible.
9.24
This will mean making your point clear to the other side, too. Sometimes
it’s tempting to try to keep some aspect of your case dark, so that the other
side can’t counter it. Always resist that temptation: if any argument or bit of
evidence is to help you win your case, it’s got to be made clear to the
tribunal. And you can’t do that without making it clear to the other side too
– for the simple reason that they will be there. Negotiation can be quite like
poker: each side can only see their own cards. But by the time of the
hearing, you’re playing a game much more like chess: everyone can see the
whole board.

Be honest

9.25
Professional representatives will, of course, be bound by their regulatory
and ethical codes not to lie to or mislead the tribunal. But this is also the
best advice for anyone appearing before the tribunal.
9.26
A tribunal that doesn’t trust you won’t be persuaded by you. It is easy to
lose this trust by being caught in minor inaccuracies and exaggerations. It
can be very tempting to overstep this line, for example, by telling the
tribunal something that you think (or hope) is true. But once a tribunal starts
to think you are unreliable, it is very hard to recover their trust. The same
goes for giving your evidence.

Giving your own evidence
9.27
Giving your own evidence is not strictly advocacy – but if you’re
representing yourself, it’s part of what you have to do at the hearing to win
your case; so it’s as logical to deal with it here as anywhere.
9.28
The promise you make to the tribunal is to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. This is a solemn commitment that every witness
is required to make – whether they swear on a holy book, or give a nonreligious affirmation.
9.29
It’s a promise you should keep. Telling lies is an effective way to win the
case for the other side.
9.30
Trying to sustain a lie or a series of lies is to enter into a demanding
contest with the lawyer conducting the cross-examination, which the
witness is likely to lose. Most witnesses giving evidence and responding to
cross-examination will be doing something they have never done before,
under high pressure and in unfamiliar surroundings. Most lawyers crossexamining witnesses are doing something they have been carefully trained
to do, and have honed their skills over a large number of previous hearings.
The contest is an unequal one. The witness’s eagerness to give the ‘right’

answer (that is, the answer that is the most beneficial rather than the most
truthful) is a weakness that can be exploited.4
9.31
Trying to add ‘spin’ to the story is nearly as effective as outright lying.
It’s common for witnesses to try to put a gloss on their evidence, making
themselves look a bit better, or the other side look a bit worse. Again, this is
hard to sustain under cross-examination. If a damaging admission has to be
made, far better to make it candidly than to have it wrung out of you after a
lot of hedging. If the other side has done something a bit bad, trying to dress
it up as worse than it is, and then having to retreat under pressure, will just
tend to obscure the fact that it was bad to begin with.
9.32
Another common, but counter-productive, tactic is to avoid answering
the question – either by simple refusal or by answering another question
that you like better. This is just likely to give the tribunal the impression
that you don’t have a good answer. Unfortunately, it is easy to slip into.
9.33
For an advocate, the most disappointing kind of witness to cross-examine
is one who simply gives a short, clear, calm and truthful answer to every
question. As a witness being cross-examined, aim to be as disappointing as
possible.
9.34
This isn’t easy, partly because – in ordinary life – it is such an odd way to
behave. In general conversation people ask questions, but they do not
expect concise and carefully relevant factual answers. A question is just a
cue for the other person to start talking and, at most, a suggestion of a
possible topic. Anyone who – on a social occasion – treated questions as a
genuine requests for factual information and acted accordingly would be
thought strange; but when you’re giving evidence, that’s exactly how you
need to behave.

Cross-examination
9.35
Cross-examination – that is to say, asking questions of the other side’s
witnesses – is probably the most important part of tribunal advocacy.

What you are trying to achieve
9.36
There are essentially two things you are trying to do in cross-examination.
The first is to get the witness to give evidence that the tribunal will accept,
but which will assist your case more than theirs. So, for instance, if you’re
acting for Saifur Rahman, when you cross-examine Mark Bowland, you
will want to get him to confirm that he congratulated Saifur on his
performance at his probationary review, that he had had feedback that the
patients liked Saifur’s gentle and respectful manner with them, that he was
generally happy with Saifur’s work, and that he thought highly enough to
promote Saifur in November 2010. Mark Bowland probably won’t deny
any of this, especially the parts that are clear on the face of the documents,
but he is unlikely to have seen fit to emphasise these points of his own
accord either.
9.37
This is quite a good example of the kind of situation in which the order of
questions can be important. If you just start by asking Mark to confirm that
he thought well of Saifur, he may be inclined to hedge. But if you set this
up by asking him specific factual questions about patient feedback, the
probationary review and the promotion, it will be much harder for him to do
anything but agree with your follow-up ‘So you must have had quite a high
opinion of Saifur at this point?’ Even if he disagrees, your work is done,
because disagreeing will make him look inconsistent and unreliable.
9.38
The second purpose of cross-examination is to undermine the parts of the
witness’s evidence that harm your case, by demonstrating that it is careless,
mistaken or untruthful. Suppose, for instance, that Elaine Watson (one of
the disciplinary panel that dismissed Saifur) has implied that Mrs Goody
could not have been expected to be alert enough to give a reliable statement
about the allegation that Saifur had sworn at Sister Winston in her presence
and then frightened her by moving her roughly in a temper. If it was
common knowledge – and something of a running joke – that Mrs Goody
was a dangerous poker player who would win whole packets of Smarties off
unsuspecting visitors, you can use this to good effect in cross-examination
of Ms Watson. Either she knew nothing of Mrs Goody’s reputation, in

which case she had no business making assumptions about her alertness
with no evidence; or else she did know Mrs Goody’s reputation, in which
case her evidence is positively misleading.
9.39
The aim of all cross-examination is to persuade the tribunal to find in
your favour. Claimants are often disappointed that respondent witnesses
rarely admit to having been untruthful, and continue to insist on their
version of events even after the holes in their story have been pointed out.
This is to be expected. By the time a witness gives his evidence, she has
either decided to lie or, more likely, convinced herself that her version of
events is true. If cross-examination has shown that the respondent’s
evidence is inconsistent with the documents in ways their witnesses cannot
coherently explain, that’s enough. It’s worth pushing witnesses far enough
to demonstrate to the tribunal that their story is thoroughly implausible; but
there’s no need to go further than that and try to bully them into admitting
that they have been talking nonsense.
Example
Suppose the dismissal letter has been shown to have been drafted by HR
and approved by the dismissing officer the day before the disciplinary
hearing, and then handed to the claimant half an hour after the end of the
hearing, but the dismissing officer still insists that he approached the
hearing with an open mind. You might sensibly say:
Q: So you’re asking the tribunal to believe that even though you had
approved Saifur Rahman’s draft dismissal letter the day before, you started
the meeting not knowing whether you were going to dismiss or not?
No doubt the witness will say something like, ‘Yes, because that’s how it
was. Just because I had a draft ready in case I decided to dismiss doesn’t
mean I had to use it.’ The answer is unconvincing, but you can leave it
there; nothing further will be achieved by saying, ‘But that’s completely
implausible, isn’t it?’

Preparing questions for witnesses

9.40
There are two views on whether or not it’s a good idea to prepare a detailed
list of questions for witnesses. Those against say a list of prepared questions
reduces your ability to adapt to changing circumstances in the course of the
hearing. At worst, you might dry up completely when the witness turns in a
direction you’re not expecting; or you may just be so focused on working
through your list that you fail to adjust your manner or style to the way the
witness is responding. Reading from a list of questions can make you sound
wooden.
9.41
Those in favour point out that producing a list of questions allows you to
prepare in a degree of detail that is hard to achieve in any other way. In
particular, the order in which you ask questions can make a surprisingly big
difference to the answers that you get – there is an example of this at para
9.50 below. It is difficult to make use of this unless you have prepared in
quite a lot of detail.
9.42
We are both list-makers. If you’re an experienced advocate and you
belong to the other camp, you have found what suits you and you should
stick to it. But if you’re a beginner, or representing yourself, or you only
appear in the tribunal very occasionally, we do recommend lists of
questions. It’s better to risk sounding a bit wooden than to miss out a crucial
topic, or annoy the tribunal by coming back to the same territory over and
over. A list can also have the advantage that – if you are representing – you
may have time to run your questions past your client before you crossexamine. That can have two advantages: your client may be able to tell you
what the witness is likely to say in response to some of your questions, and
what to ask next if they do. It can also reassure your client that you are
going to cover everything that needs to be covered: if they’ve seen your
questions in advance, they’re less likely to distract you while you crossexamine by trying to suggest question to you.
9.43
Remember that just because you have a list of questions, it doesn’t mean
you have to follow it religiously. Always be prepared to depart from it to
press a productive line of questioning or to respond to the witness’s
answers.

9.44
In case you stray widely from your list of questions, it’s also helpful to
have a summary checklist of the key areas to cover with each witness and to
remember to look at it before ending the cross-examination. In the heat of
the moment – and especially if one part of the cross-examination went
either particularly well or particularly badly – it’s all too easy to forget to
cover a whole topic. For an adviser, it is sensible to take a moment to check
with your client that there is nothing he thinks you should have asked that
you did not. A claimant acting in person should similarly be allowed to
confer briefly with a friend or relative accompanying them.

Putting your case
9.45
Many tribunals and practitioners will say that a further purpose of crossexamination is to put your case to the other side’s witnesses. This is really a
throw-back to the days before witness statements, when witnesses for one
side would only have the chance to comment on the other side’s evidence if
that evidence was put to them in cross-examination. Suppose Mr Sneath,
the claimant, was going to say in his evidence that Mrs Blewitt, the
personnel manager, gave him a thumbs down sign the day before the
disciplinary hearing and said ‘I hope you’ve got good lawyers because
you’re going to need them.’ Mrs Blewitt gives her evidence first. The
tribunal will want to hear what she says to his allegation – does she admit it
or deny it, and if she denies it does she do so convincingly? So if there have
been no witness statements, Mrs Blewitt must be asked: ‘You gave Mr
Sneath a thumbs down sign the day before the hearing didn’t you?’; and
‘And then you said “I hope you’ve got good lawyers, etc”?’ Otherwise she
will never get a chance to comment on Mr Sneath’s evidence.
9.46
Lawyers are conservative by nature, and it is still conventional – even
though witness statements are now almost universal in employment tribunal
proceedings in England and Wales – to put the case to the opposing
witnesses. Tribunals will still occasionally refuse to take account of
evidence for one side that has not been put to the other side’s witnesses in
cross-examination. Although there is no longer a practical need for this

exercise, therefore, it’s still advisable to ensure that every disputed
allegation by the claimant is put to the relevant witness or witnesses on the
other side. This can feel very artificial: the result is likely to be a series of
questions of the form:
Q: ‘You did ABC didn’t you?’
A: ‘No.’
Q: ‘And then you said DEF?’
A: ‘No.’
Q: ‘The claimant did not do GHI as you say, did he?’
A: ‘Yes he did.’
Q: ‘The truth was you said JKL wasn’t it?’
A: ‘Nope.’
9.47
This is a wearying performance for everyone, but until the Employment
Appeal Tribunal rules that the practice is redundant, it is necessary.

What questions should you ask?
9.48
Often there will be deliberate ambiguities in a statement that need to be
teased out. Sometimes there will be inconsistencies between one part of the
statement and another, or between this witness’s evidence and that of one of
the respondent’s other witnesses. Sometimes there will be documentary
evidence that contradicts what the witness says. Sometimes the statement
will have been drafted by a lawyer who has been too keen to put the ‘right’
words into the witness’s mouth, and the witness when asked will simply
contradict his own statement.
9.49
Some rules of thumb may be helpful. Leading questions are usually
preferable: the aim is to take the witness where you want him to go by
asking a series of questions to which there is only one possible answer. Start
with easy, non-threatening questions. If you hope to elicit helpful
admissions from the witness – confirmation that the claimant was a good,
reliable worker with a clean disciplinary record, and so on – do that first,

before you have made him defensive and unforthcoming by trying to
destroy his credibility in other areas.
9.50
The order in which questions on a particular issue are asked can be
crucial. The key is often to predict what the witness will think is the ‘right’
answer, and then ask the questions in an order that exploits that.
Example 1
Suppose you are cross-examining Sister Winston, the nurse who got Saifur
Rahman sacked because he had blown the whistle on her misuse of
sedatives. She has said in her witness statement that she held no grudge
against Saifur. This is implausible, but if you tackle it head on you won’t get
far:
Q: You must have been angry with Saifur when you heard that he had
reported your remark about Somnex?
A: No. I was surprised, because I thought it was obvious that what I said
was a joke, but if it worried him of course he had to raise it.
Q: But if he’d been believed, you’d have been in terrible trouble?
A: I suppose so, but I never really thought about that because it was so
obvious that I didn’t mean it.
The point will have much more impact if you start the other end:
Q: Have you ever administered sedatives that have not been prescribed?
A: No, of course not.
Q: It would be serious misconduct for a nurse to do this?
A: Yes.
Q: If a nurse did administer sedatives without a prescription and was found
out, you’d expect him or her to face disciplinary action from the hospital
and from the Nursing and Midwifery Council?
A: Yes.
Q: They’d almost certainly be sacked?
A: I should think so.
Q: And it would be even worse if a Ward Sister instructed a more junior
nurse to administer a sedative that had not been prescribed?
A: Yes.

Q: So if Saifur Rahman’s allegation had been believed, you would have
been in serious trouble?
A: I suppose so, yes.
Q: You must have been worried when you were asked about it?
A: Not really.
From this point, she might well say yes; but even if she denies it, after what
has gone before her denial is likely to sound hollow.
Q: You felt angry with Saifur for getting you into trouble?
Her answer here doesn’t matter very much. If she sticks to her guns and
denies that she felt any anger towards Saifur, she is unlikely to convince. If
she admits that she did feel angry with him, she has usefully contradicted
her own witness statement. Either way, you have done quite a bit to
demonstrate that she was likely to have had a serious grudge against Saifur.
Example 2
Suppose the witness to be cross-examined is the manager who decided to
dismiss the claimant. The reason given for the dismissal was that the
claimant was believed to have been responsible (accidentally) for starting a
damaging fire. The claimant believes that the fire was a convenient excuse,
and the real reason for his dismissal was that he had been complaining
about changes in the way he was paid. His representative has noticed that
the date on the fire service report implicating the claimant is after the date
of the dismissal letter. This is damaging for the respondent, because it tends
to support the claimant’s belief that the fire was not the real reason for his
dismissal – but it is not necessarily fatal and the manager may be able to
explain it away.
Wrong
Q: Please turn to the fire report on page 24. What is the date on it?
The witness has no scope to hedge – the date is there in black and white.
Q: Now turn to the dismissal letter on page 21. What is the date on that?
Again, there is only one possible answer, and already the witness will see
the point that is about to be made and be starting to think about how he can
deal with it.
Q: Why didn’t you wait until you had seen the fire service report before
deciding to dismiss the claimant?

This is the witness’s opportunity for damage limitation. He has not
damaged his credibility by lying because he has been given no opportunity
to do so.
Right
Q: This was an important decision wasn’t it?
The only possible answer to this is ‘yes’.
Q: Did you make sure you had all relevant information before you took it?
Here too there is an obvious ‘right’ answer and 99 in 100 witnesses will
give it.
Q: There was a fire service investigation into the cause of the fire wasn’t
there?
There is no point denying this: the witness will almost certainly know that
the report is in the bundle.
Q: The point of that was to establish the cause of the fire?
There is not much point denying that either.
Q: Did you take the fire service report into account before you decided to
dismiss?
Now the witness is in a tight place. He has just confirmed that he took into
account all relevant information. He is now being asked about a piece of
highly and obviously relevant information that he did not take into account.
With luck, he may forget in the heat of the moment that the report post-dates
the dismissal letter, and give the ‘right’ answer – ‘Yes, of course I did’. If he
does, the trap can be sprung:
Q: Turn to the dismissal letter – what is the date on it?
Q: Turn to the fire report – what is the date on that?
Q: So your answer just now that you read the fire report before you decided
to dismiss was not true, was it?
Even if the witness was too canny to lie, he is still much worse placed
having claimed to have taken all relevant information into account and then
being forced to admit that this was not the case than he would be if simply
challenged directly about the sequence of events as in the first example.
Example 3
The witness is a manager who claims to have been unaware that the
claimant, whom she appointed, was disabled at the time she dismissed him

for poor performance. In the papers there are two probationary appraisals,
conducted by the manager, that say that the claimant was trying his best
and was responsive to feedback. The job is not a difficult one, and on paper
the claimant is over-qualified for it. The manager says that she knew the
claimant was dyslexic, but did not think it was serious enough to amount to
a disability for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010.
Wrong
Q: You knew Derek was dyslexic didn’t you?
This much is uncontroversial.
Q: You knew he was intelligent enough to get a first class degree in history?
The witness is given the opportunity to wriggle with something like ‘I
interview a lot of new staff – I did not remember his exact qualifications.’
Q: So if he was underachieving in this junior role it must have been because
of his dyslexia?
This is an open invitation to the witness to think of some other plausible
reason – ‘No – I thought he was over-qualified for the role and not very
well motivated.’ She can be challenged on her own assessment in his
probationary reviews that he was doing his best, but now she knows where
the questioning is going she may say that this was an over-generous
assessment in an attempt to motivate him.
Right
Q: You appointed Derek?
There is no reason why she should deny this.
Q: You read his CV?
Reading his CV before appointing him was obviously the right thing to do,
so 9 out of 10 personnel managers will say ‘yes’ even if they have no
specific memory of having done so.
Q: So you knew he had a first class degree?
This is hard to deny – the CV is there in the bundle, and she has just
admitted to having read it.
Q: You did not require a graduate at all in this role?
She is unlikely to deny this – she knows that the person specification is in
the bundle.
Q: You conducted the two probationary reviews?
Again, she cannot sensibly deny this.

Q: Did you conduct them fairly and accurately to the best of your ability?
Again, there is only one answer to this.
Q: So you stand by your assessment that Derek was doing his best?
Now she is in a place where it is difficult for her to deny this too.
Q: And that he was responsive to feedback?
Similarly.
Q: But he was under-performing so badly that you had to dismiss him?
She has to say yes to this because it is at the heart of her case.
Q: You knew he was dyslexic?
In this context, the question is going somewhere.
Q: Given that you knew Derek was able and doing his best, that was the
obvious explanation for his difficulties wasn’t it?
All the likely alternative explanations have been ruled out, so it is difficult
for the witness to deny this now.

When a witness doesn’t answer a question
9.51
Witnesses generally won’t outright refuse to answer a question under crossexamination. If they do, the judge will normally order them to answer
(unless the judge agrees that the question is improper, or relates to
privileged material, in which case you will be told to move on).
9.52
But it’s common for witnesses to avoid answering a question, normally
by answering some other question, or making a speech, or asking you a
question.
9.53
You don’t necessarily have to regard this as a bad thing: often, a witness
conspicuously refusing to answer a question is the turning point of a case.
9.54
If the witness has answered some other question, allow for the possibility
that they have misunderstood you. Explain, briefly that that wasn’t the
question you were asking and rephrase it. Sometimes, a seemingly evasive
witness really has misunderstood the question. Even if they haven’t,
rephrasing the question emphasises that they have not answered it, and
gives them another opportunity. This presents the witness with a dilemma.

Either they answer the question they don’t want to, or dodge it again. If they
do dodge, underline that and ask again: ‘I’m afraid you still haven’t
answered my question. Did you …?’ If they still don’t answer – and
depending on how the tribunal is reacting – you may want to give them one
last chance – something like: ‘Mr Smith, I’ve asked you this question twice.
You have not answered it. I’m going to try once more and then move on.
Did you …?’ If they still don’t answer, move on to your next question.
9.55
A witness who is repeatedly evasive can be undermined by this simple
strategy of pointing out that they won’t answer your questions, despite
being given repeated opportunities to do so. But be careful and honest. If
the witness is not evasive, pretending that they are will only make you look
bad.
9.56
If the witness asks you a question, then unless it’s a request for a
clarification of the question or help with finding a document in the bundle,
don’t answer it. If necessary, the stock reply is ‘I’m sorry, Mr Smith. I’m
afraid I’m not here to answer your questions.’ Although it may be
necessary, this is an unmistakable put-down – so deliver it gently and
without bluster.

Re-examination
9.57
The best general advice on re-examination is ‘Don’t’. It will rarely help and
may do harm. If you think that part of your witness’s evidence has been
damaged under cross-examination, asking further questions on the same
subject will tend to emphasise the point. And your witness may be feeling
bruised from cross-examination, so her ability to understand the point you
are getting at and deal with it helpfully is likely to be reduced anyway.
9.58
Only re-examine if you are reasonably confident that the witness has
previously given an apparently misleading or inconsistent answer simply
because she failed to understand the question properly; and that you can
give her an opportunity to repair the damage without leading.

Example
Your client was summarily dismissed on 21 June 2014 for smoking at work
two days earlier. In cross-examination, he faced the following line of
questioning:
Q: You were aware of the respondent’s policy that smoking would be
treated as gross misconduct?
A: No, I had never heard of it.
Q: An e-mail addressed to ‘staff@prissco.co.uk’ would reach you?
A: Yes.
Q: And presumably if you received an e-mail from Dave Smart you would
read it?
A: Of course.
Q: Especially if it was marked ‘important announcement’.
A: Yes.
Q: Turn to page 217 of the bundle. [This is an e-mail from Dave Smart
addressed to staff@prissco.co.uk headed ‘important announcement’
announcing the policy.] What is the date on it?
A: 9/3/14.
Q: So the policy was announced three months before you were dismissed,
but you ignored it?
A: I’ve never seen this e-mail before.
Q: You have already agreed that an e-mail addressed to
‘staff@prissco.co.uk’ would reach you, but now you say that this particular
e-mail didn’t reach you?
A: I don’t understand why this didn’t reach me, but I never saw it.
Your client has been made to look quite bad at this point. He is denying
knowledge of something that, on the face of it, he was told in clear terms
only a few months before the dismissal. What you have noticed in the course
of this exchange, however, is that Dave Smart’s e-mails tend to be dated,
American fashion, ‘mm/dd/yy’ instead of ‘dd/mm/yy’. This means that the
date on this e-mail is in fact 3 September 2014, after the dismissal, rather
than 9 March 2014. It did not reach your client for the simple reason that at
the time it was sent, he was no longer employed by Prissco.

This is the kind of damage you probably can repair (provided the witness is
moderately quick-witted) in re-examination:
Q: Please turn to page 217. You were asked whether you had received this
at the time, and said that you had not. Would you turn to page 346? What is
this?
A: Dave Smart’s e-mail asking me to the disciplinary hearing on 21 June.
Q: What is the date on it?
A: 6/19/14. That’s odd … oh, I suppose it must be 19 June 2014. I think
Dave’s e-mails were always dated like that.
Q: Would you turn back to page 217. When do you think this e-mail was
sent?
A: I’d say 3 September 2014.
Note that this is achieved without leading. If you just ask ‘Dave’s e-mails
always showed the date American style, starting with the month, didn’t
they? So the date on the e-mail at page 217 is 3 September not 9 March?’
you have led your witness shamelessly.

Submissions
9.59
By the end of the evidence the tribunal should have a clear idea of what the
case is about and what your claim is. If they don’t, something has gone
badly wrong.
9.60
Submissions are your opportunity to draw attention the best evidence in
your favour, explain any weak points in your case and deal with any legal
points that need to be addressed.
9.61
There are significant advantages to doing some of your advocacy on
paper and it is common for parties to put in written submissions in addition
to oral ones. This is rarely compulsory. For many people a key advantage of
written submission is simply the process of writing down what you want to
tell the tribunal. Writing submissions can help to clarify your thoughts

about the case and put them into order. It also maximises your chances of
remembering to make all the points you want to make.
9.62
Additionally, doing written and oral submissions gives you two shots at
convincing the tribunal of your case. They will take your written
submissions away, and may be convinced by them sometime after the
hearing has finished.
9.63
Finally, there are some cases where written submissions are simply more
helpful than oral ones. If your case involves complex facts or requires
statistical analysis, it will be easier for the tribunal to absorb written
information.

Advice on submissions
9.64
Your starting point should be your list of issues. For each issue, tell the
tribunal what you want them to decide and explain why they should.
9.65
It is sometimes also helpful to deal generally with the credibility of each
side’s witnesses. Many cases come down to who the tribunal believes.
Often this means drawing the tribunal’s attention to patterns, either in an
individual witnesses evidence or the witnesses’ evidence on a particular
point.
9.66
For example, a witness who has repeatedly been caught out by
inconsistencies between their evidence and the documents, can be
undermined by assembling these incidents together:
Madam, you will recall that, on a number of occasions Mr Smith gave
evidence that was directly contradicted by the documents.
First, he said that Ms Jones had not been involved in the decision to hold
an investigation. But he had to accept that he had e-mailed Mr Sampson
on 11th February saying that he was acting on Ms Jones’ advice.
Second, he said that he had not seen the e-mail my client sent on 2nd
April. Yet he accepted that he had mentioned that e-mail in the letter to
my client on 12th May.

Third, ...
9.67
Similarly, if a number of witnesses have had difficulty on a particular issue,
this can be used effectively:
Sir, Mr Smith, Ms Jones and Mr Sampson were all asked who took the
final decision to dismiss my client. They all agreed that it was one of the
three of them – but could not agree on who it was!
9.68
The tribunal is not the place for oratory. The best approach is to be calm and
matter of fact. Anything that hints of a television legal drama should be
avoided. The best style is something like a helpful civil servant, there to
assist the tribunal by presenting one side of the case.
9.69
Don’t exaggerate or say that evidence proves something that it doesn’t.
Often the evidence will not prove something conclusively, but will strongly
suggest it. If you claim that it is conclusive, when it isn’t, you weaken your
case.
9.70
If the respondent’s case has strong elements, or some evidence came out
their way, it is best to deal with these points rather than ignoring them in the
hope that they will go away.
9.71
It is quite likely that the tribunal will interrupt with questions. This is
almost always a good thing. It gives you a chance to communicate with
them, and find out what’s bothering them. Listen carefully to the question
and try to deal with it honestly.
9.72
Don’t feel that you have to say absolutely everything that could possibly
be said. It is best to focus on the most important points. The extent to which
you need to deal in detail with the evidence will depend on the length of the
hearing. In a long case, it is sensible to remind the tribunal, concisely, of the
important evidence, some of which may have been given days, or weeks,
ago. In a short case, you can assume that the tribunal has a clear
recollection and you need only touch on the important points.

9.73
A good starting point is that oral submissions should be no longer than 20
minutes per day of the hearing.
9.74
When you have made your points, stop. It’s conventional to say
something like ‘Thank you, Madam. Unless you have any questions, those
are my submissions.’ It doesn’t matter if you don’t – but it may be
comforting to have this standard phrase to hand, rather than just tailing off.

Replying to submissions
9.75
If you speak first, you should be allowed to respond to the other side’s
submissions if they’ve said something about the law that you haven’t
already dealt with. You won’t normally be allowed to respond on the rival
factual assertions.
9.76
If you do say anything in reply, you should aim to be very brief. This is
not an opportunity to repeat your previous arguments. If you feel you have
nothing new to say, simply reply ‘Thank you. I don’t think I have anything
to add to my previous submissions.’

Written submissions
9.77
All of the advice on oral submissions applies equally to written
submissions. Be guided by the list of issues and try to be as clear and
concise as possible.

PRECEDENT 9.77: Written submissions – Rahman
This precedent is incomplete. A real set of written submissions would be
much longer.
IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL
Case No 123456/14
LONDON CENTRAL

BETWEEN
SAIFUR RAHMAN
Claimant
and
SAINT JULIAN’S HOSPITAL NHS TRUST
Respondent
Written Submissions for the Claimant
1. Mr Rahman was employed as a porter by St Julian’s Hospital NHS Trust.
He was dismissed on 27 April 2014. The hospital says that he was
dismissed for misconduct – specifically for swearing at a Ward Sister,
Lorraine Winston, and moving a patient roughly. Mr Rahman denies this
accusation. He says that Sister Winston fabricated her allegations, because
he had previously reported an incident of her misconduct. He has brought
claims for unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal.
Issues
2. The tribunal will have to decide the following issues:
Unfair dismissal
a) Was Mr Rahman dismissed for making a protected disclosure?
b) Did the hospital carry out a reasonable investigation of Mr Rahman’s
alleged misconduct?
c) Was Mr Rahman given an effective right of appeal?
Wrongful dismissal
d) Did Mr Rahman commit the acts of gross misconduct he was accused
of?
Was Mr Rahman dismissed for making a protected disclosure?
3. This issue resolves itself to two questions. Did Sister Winston fabricate
her allegations because Mr Rahman had reported the Somnex incident? If
so, was this the reason that Mr Rahman was dismissed?
4. There is good reason to believe that Sister Winston lied when she
accused Mr Rahman of misconduct.

5. First, Sister Winston’s allegations were inconsistent with all the available
evidence of Mr Rahman’s normal demeanour and conduct.
6. ...
7. Mr Rahman’s own evidence about the allegations against him was
credible ...
8. Sister Winston accepted that she knew about Mr Rahman’s complaint.
She told the tribunal that it had not bothered her and she did not feel any
hostility towards Mr Rahman because of it. This is not credible. Mr
Rahman accused Sister Winston of serious professional misconduct. If his
complaint had been upheld disciplinary action against Sister Winston would
have been inevitable. Both Sister Winston and the hospital managers
accepted, during cross-examination, that she would almost certainly been
dismissed and that proceedings by the Nursing and Midwifery Council were
likely. In these circumstances, Sister Winston’s suggestion that she felt no
anger towards Mr Rahman cannot be believed. Her attempt to suggest
otherwise was disingenuous and should cast doubt on the rest of her
evidence.
9. ...
10. The only plausible explanation for Sister Winston fabricating her
allegations against Mr Rahman is in revenge for his protected disclosure.
Did the hospital carry out a reasonable investigation of Mr Rahman’s
alleged misconduct?
11. Fairness required the Hospital to make proper inquiries into the
allegations against Mr Rahman.
12. The hospital did not carry out a reasonable investigation. Their
approach was flawed in two ways:
13. They failed to understand the significance of the Somnex incident,
considering it irrelevant to Mr Rahman’s disciplinary proceedings.
14. They failed to interview relevant witnesses, who would have supported
Mr Rahman, in particular Lisa Goody and Penny Short.

Somnex incident
15. The hospital regarded the Somnex incident as irrelevant. It was not.
16. The fact that Mr Rahman had made a serious allegation of professional
misconduct against Sister Winston was highly relevant to considering any
accusation she made against him. By disregarding it, the disciplinary panel
approached her accusation as if she had no reason to lie. This was not the
case.
17. This error led to the hospital’s failure to examine Sister Winston’s
evidence critically. She was not called as a witness at the disciplinary
hearing, which relied entirely on her written allegation. The fact that
nobody at the hospital subjected her to questioning would be itself
sufficient to make the process unfair. This failure, however, also underlines
a more serious failure – an assumption that any allegation made by a senior
nurse could be unquestioningly believed. Mr Eastleigh said under crossexamination: ‘There was no reason to think that she might be lying.’
18. The impact of this omission can also be seen by considering Sister
Winston’s evidence to this tribunal. Her weakness as a witness of fact and
lack of credibility is discussed in detail above, see 8 to 9.
Relevant witnesses
19. Both Lisa Goody and Penny Short were relevant witnesses, who should
have been questioned.
20. Lisa Goody was the patient who Mr Rahman was alleged to have
mistreated. Yet she was not asked about the incident.
21. The hospital argues that it would have been inappropriate to ask a
vulnerable patient questions. Their position was explained by Mr Eastleigh.
He said that he, and the rest of the disciplinary panel, believed it was wrong
to question a geriatric patient because it would disturb the patient and their
evidence would be unreliable. When asked why he thought Mrs Goody’s
evidence would be unreliable, he talked in general terms about patients with
dementia. When pressed, he accepted that he had no knowledge of Ms
Goody’s physical or mental condition.

22. Ms Goody is not vulnerable in any relevant sense. Neither the fact that
she has broken her hip, nor her age (87) means she is incapable or unable to
answer simple questions about whether she had been mistreated.
23. Mr Rahman’s evidence that Ms Goody is an intelligent and engaged
women was not disputed. Indeed, it was supported by the hospital staff who
knew her. All said that she was mentally active and showed no signs of
cognitive decline or dementia. Far from it: both nurse White and nurse
Sampson said she liked to play poker with the other patients – and generally
won.
24. The hospital’s decision not to question her, therefore, was not based on
any assessment of Ms Goody’s situation or characteristics. It was merely an
assumption that, because she was a geriatric patient, she must be vulnerable
and probably suffering from dementia. This was not an assumption that a
reasonable investigation would have made.
25. Ms Goody was not able to attend the tribunal, because of her mobility
problems. Her letter dated 1 December, however, gives a clear indication of
what she would have said had she been questioned in the course of the
hospital’s investigation. She writes that Mr Rahman treated her with great
care and politeness; she categorically denies that he acted as the hospital
alleges at any time. She also says that if she had been treated in such a way,
she would not have hesitated to complain to the hospital.
26. This is convincing evidence in support of Mr Rahman that would have
had significant impact if it had been before the disciplinary panel. When
questioned about Ms Goody’s letter, Mr Eastleigh confessed that it did give
him pause and raised ‘significant concerns’.
27. Similarly, Penny Short, who witnessed the alleged incident was not
questioned.
Was Mr Rahman given an effective right of appeal?
28. Mr Rahman was not given an effective right appeal. He was told, by Mr
Eastleigh, the Chair of the Disciplinary Hearing, that there was little point
in appealing unless he was prepared to apologise to Sister Winston. This

statement prevented Mr Rahman from appealing. He was unwilling to
apologise for something that he did not do.
29. The ACAS Code provides a right of appeal, see paragraphs 25–28. This
is a broad right and there are many different points that an employee may
properly advance through an internal appeal.
30. The hospital’s Disciplinary Code also contains a right of appeal (bundle,
p 75, para 15). Paragraph 16 sets out a wide range of matters that may be
raised on appeal, including a failure on the part of the Disciplinary
Committee to consider evidence or make appropriate investigations.
31. If an employee was told, in advance, that he could appeal, but that it
would inevitably be rejected, he would have no effective right of appeal.
This would be unfair. There is no real difference between that situation and
Mr Rahman’s. He was told that his appeal would inevitably be rejected,
unless it included an apology.
32. Any restriction of an employee’s appeal right would be unfair, but the
requirement to apologise was particularly so in this case. The points that Mr
Rahman would have wished to raise in any appeal would have been:
• that the disciplinary hearing had failed to take account of the protected
disclosure and therefore Sister Winston’s motive to lie, and
• they had failed to investigate the allegation, in particular by not talking
to Lisa Goody and Penny Short.
33. Mr Rahman could not have raised these issues, while also apologising
to Sister Winston. An apology would have required accepting Sister
Winston’s account. The effect of Mr Eastleigh’s statement, therefore, was to
prevent Mr Rahman appealing on the points that he wished to raise.
34. In their ET3, the hospital denied that Mr Rahman had been told that
there was no point in appealing unless he was prepared to apologise to
Sister Winston. In cross-examination, however, Mr Eastleigh said:
I told him something like, before you decide about appealing, think hard
about that apology. I said that I couldn’t see how an appeal could succeed
if he wasn’t willing to apologise.

35. Mr Eastleigh continued to deny that he had used the phrase ‘there is not
much point in appealing unless you are prepared to apologise’. However, he
agreed that that was, in substance, what he had said.
Did Mr Rahman commit the acts of gross misconduct he was accused
of?
36. ...
Conclusion
37. For the reasons set out above, the tribunal is asked to find that Mr
Rahman was unfairly and wrongfully dismissed.

Introduction
10.1
‘Remedy’ is the term used to describe what the claimant gets if successful.
Mostly it’s a sum of money, although in some cases other remedies like
reinstatement, or a recommendation that the employer should do something,
are available.
10.2
Although remedy is normally the last thing to be considered by the
tribunal, it should be among the first things to be considered by the
claimant.
10.3
This chapter is not intended to be a detailed account of the law relating to
remedies in the employment tribunal: rather it aims to give guidance about
how to approach the question of remedy and some tips on how to maximise
compensation.
10.4
For simplicity, and because most claims relate to dismissal one way or
another, the discussion here is mainly confined to dismissal.

What do you want?
10.5
People bring tribunal cases for many different reasons and to achieve very
different things. There is unlikely to be a single reason for bringing
proceedings. Instead there will be a complex mix of pragmatism – ‘I need
the money I haven’t been paid’ or ‘I need to sort this out so I can get
another job’ – altruism – ‘Nobody else is going to go through what I’ve
been through’ or ‘I’m going to take a stand’ – and emotional – ‘Bastards –
I’m not going to let them get away with it!’

10.6
It’s important to be clear about what you want, and whether it can be
achieved through the tribunal process. To be useful this must be done at an
early stage. Ideally, preparation for the tribunal process should work
backwards, starting with what you want to achieve and then deciding what
you need to do to achieve it.
10.7
If you’re an adviser, be particularly careful to make sure you have
understood your client’s aims. Advisers have a tendency to focus on
financial outcomes, because those are the most readily achievable. But that
can miss the point. Sometimes the case is all about money, but it may be
that what the client mainly wants is to retain a professional accreditation (or
just get a reference) they need to get another job, or to ensure that the terms
of their mortgage insurance are met – or even to be allowed to keep as a pet
the security dog they have worked with for years.
10.8
Take care to manage your client’s expectations. The cases that hit the
headlines tend to be high value claims. Most tribunal awards are for much
more modest sums. If the only cases your client has read about have
involved awards in the hundreds of thousands they may overestimate
significantly any likely award.
10.9
Claimants also sometimes want to ‘clear their name’ or punish their
employer, or humiliate their former line-manager in front of more senior
managers. The last may sound like straight revenge, but it can serve a
legitimate purpose. Managers wield a significant power over their
subordinates, and it is salutary for them to learn that misuse of this power
can lead to having to give a detailed public account of their actions under
cross-examination.
10.10
But aims of this kind do need to be treated with caution, because the
tribunal itself is likely to have a more limited view of its role.
10.11
Many claimants – and respondents too – have exaggerated expectations
of the tribunal system. A full tribunal consists of three men and women who
should have, between them, a reasonably wide experience of workplace

disputes, and one at least of whom will know some employment law. If
your case is to be heard by an employment judge alone, your case may be
heard by a lawyer whose only personal experience of being an employee is
as a part-time judge. That’s not much like most people’s experience of
employment.
10.12
But even if you have a full tribunal with an excellent combined
knowledge and experience, their knowledge of the circumstances of this
particular dispute will be limited to what they can glean from the papers and
what the witnesses tell them. They have no special ability to detect
untruthfulness in a witness or to compel a witness to tell the truth. Most
tribunals are reasonably fair-minded and do their honest best to get to the
right answer according to the law – but they’re only human. They get things
wrong quite a lot; and sometimes the law dictates an unfair result. Being in
the right is no guarantee of winning your case.

Recommendations and declarations
10.13
In discrimination cases, the tribunal may make a recommendation.
10.14
A recommendation is an instruction to a respondent to take action to
remove or reduce the effect of the discrimination relating to the case. For
example, in a sex discrimination claim relating to flexible working a
tribunal might recommend that the respondent introduce a flexible working
policy within six months.
10.15
There’s no power to enforce recommendations, so the tribunal cannot
force a respondent to act if they are determined not to, but failure to
implement a recommendation may lead to an increased financial award.
10.16
The purpose of a recommendation is stated in the relevant sections as
‘obviating or reducing the adverse effect on the complainant of any act of
discrimination to which the complaint relates’ on the claimant or any other
person.1 The power was widened in the Equality Act 2010 so that the
tribunal could take account of the effect on any other person, but that

extension will be repealed if and when the draft Deregulation Bill comes
into force (there is no timetable for that as yet). But even if the wider power
is repealed, don’t assume that you can’t get a recommendation unless you
are still in employment. Injury to feelings is one of the recognised kinds of
adverse effect on a claimant, and a recommendation as to the former
employer’s future conduct in relation to other employees is clearly capable
of reducing the injury to the claimant’s feelings.
10.17
The potential of recommendations should not be overlooked. Often all
the claimant wants out of a discrimination claim is financial compensation,
but, particularly where the emotional impact of the discrimination has been
profound, recommendations can be powerful. Although the tribunal cannot
enforce the recommendation, many employers (especially public sector
employers) faced with a recommendation will feel bound to make a real
attempt to comply with it.
10.18
In addition to recommendations the tribunal may make declarations of
various kinds, for example that the claimant has suffered discrimination as
to the terms of his contract of employment or that a particular statutory right
has been infringed.

Reinstatement and re-engagement
10.19
In unfair dismissal cases the tribunal has the power to order reinstatement
or re-engagement. Reinstatement is an order that the claimant be treated as
if he had not been dismissed. In effect the dismissal is cancelled. Reengagement is an order that the claimant is given employment comparable
to that from which he was dismissed ‘or other suitable employment’ on
such terms as the tribunal decides. Re-engagement is the more flexible
remedy: the tribunal can decide whether and if so to what extent to
compensate the claimant for lost earnings, whether after re-engagement he
should receive the same pay as he did before dismissal, where he should
work, and so on.
10.20

The term ‘re-employment’ doesn’t appear in the Employment Rights Act
1996 but is commonly understood by employment lawyers to refer to
reinstatement and re-engagement together.
10.21
Reinstatement and re-engagement were originally intended to be the
primary remedies for unfair dismissal, but in practice such orders are rarely
made and even more rarely complied with.
10.22
In the 2012/13 tribunal year only five such orders were made, from a
total 4,596 unfair dismissal claims upheld. In other words, in less than 0.2
per cent of successful unfair dismissal claims.
10.23
There are several reasons for this. By Employment Rights Act 1996 s116
an employer can resist re-employment on the grounds that it’s not
practicable to comply, and tribunals are reluctant to make futile orders. The
likelihood of an order for re-employment being complied with is strongly
affected by the employer’s attitude to it: if the employer is determined that
re-employment won’t work, then it almost certainly won’t. Moreover, the
time between dismissal and the tribunal hearing is now much longer than
when these powers were created. Months or even years after a dismissal
there will rarely be a realistic chance of the employee returning to work.
10.24
These difficulties tend to lead to re-employment being neglected by
claimants and their advisers. Probably one part of the reason that it is so
rare is that it is rarely sought with any real determination or expectation of
success. This is a shame, because a re-employment order has some
significant advantages and can – even where it’s unlikely to lead to an
actual return to work – be a powerful tactical weapon.
10.25
The main advantage of re-employment is that it can neutralise some of
the consequences of the cap on compensation for unfair dismissal. A
reinstatement order restores the employment as if the dismissal had never
been, and full arrears of pay and other benefits – with no upper limit – have
to be paid by the employer. The importance of this is greater now that unfair
dismissal compensation is capped at 52 weeks’ pay. If you’ve been
dismissed in circumstances that make it hard for you to get another job – for

alleged dishonesty, for example – and/or you have lost valuable pension
rights, your losses may well exceed a year’s pay.
10.26
This sum still has to be paid if the reinstatement does not in fact take
place. So if your lost earnings up to the date of the hearing are likely to
exceed 52 weeks’ pay, it’s well worth trying for a re-employment order for
the sake of enhanced compensation.
10.27
Pension rights may be a further compelling reason to try for reemployment. If you’ve been dismissed on capability grounds when you
should have been given early retirement on medical grounds, you may
suffer a pension loss for which, by reason of the upper limit on the
compensatory award, you can’t be properly compensated. Reinstatement
may allow you to be medically retired and avoid that loss, even if you’re
not fit to return to work. There is no reason why reinstatement should not be
awarded for this purpose.
10.28
Employers are often very anxious about re-employment, so the threat to
seek an order for reinstatement or re-engagement can provide them with a
powerful incentive to settle.
10.29
Note the following points that may need to be made in applying for reemployment:
There is no rule that the tribunal must not order re-employment if it is
not practicable for the employer to comply with such an order.
Practicability is just one of the factors that the tribunal must take into
account. If the employer is to blame for the impracticability, you can
sensibly argue that they shouldn’t through their own fault be permitted
to bar you from a remedy that is to your advantage, even if that
advantage is in practice confined to enhanced compensation.
If you want to be reinstated merely in order to be medically retired,
practicability is unlikely to be an issue: the employer is not in fact
going to be called upon to find a role for you, nor will there be any
need to re-establish a relationship of trust and confidence.

Contributory fault is a factor that must be taken into account in
deciding whether to order re-employment; but it’s not an outright bar.
Re-engagement is a sufficiently flexible remedy to permit the tribunal
to take account of contributory fault. If it takes the view that you were
at fault and that fault contributed to your dismissal, but the decision to
dismiss you was in fact unfair, there’s no good reason why you
shouldn’t be re-engaged with a disciplinary warning, or (if, for
example, demotion would have been fair) even in a lower-paid
position.
10.30
As with recommendations there is no power to enforce re-employment
orders, but failure to comply is likely to lead to an increased award.

Awards of money
10.31
In many cases the only applicable remedy is an order that the employer
pays the employee some money. Often the approach is compensatory: the
aim is to put you in the position you would be in (subject in some cases to
an upper limit) if you hadn’t suffered the wrong you’re complaining about.
In other cases, there’s a fixed award for breach of a specific statutory right
that doesn’t depend on proving any loss: for example, the award for failure
to provide written reasons for dismissal is two weeks’ pay.
10.32
Some of the kinds of claim employment tribunals deal with lend
themselves to straightforward arithmetic; some require a combination of
arithmetic and fortune-telling; some are compensated by the award of moreor-less conventional sums; and some are compensated by sums fixed by the
legislation. We don’t give detailed guidance in this book on how to
calculate compensation, but a few examples illustrate the different
approaches.
Example 1

Susan has been dismissed without notice in breach of contract from a job in
which she took home £180 per week. Her contract entitled her to four
weeks’ notice, and she did not get another job in that time, so her loss by
reason of the breach of contract is four weeks’ net pay.
Her damages for breach of contract are therefore:
£180 x 4 = £720
This is simple arithmetic.
Example 2
Boris earned £200 for a 40-hour week for six weeks in late 2013. The
minimum wage was £6.31 per hour during that period, so he was underpaid
by £1.31 per hour. He complains of unauthorised deductions from wages
and is awarded
£1.31 x 40 x 6 = £314.40
This too is simple arithmetic.
Example 3
Rob, who earned £500 per week, was summarily dismissed for gross
misconduct when he threw an egg sandwich at his supervisor in the course
of a heated argument about overtime. When he asked for written reasons for
dismissal his supervisor said ‘Fuck off out of here you idiot, what do you
think you’ve been dismissed for?’
The tribunal awards Rob 2 x £450 = £900 for breach of his statutory
right to written reasons for dismissal.
The award for breach of this right is two weeks’ gross pay, subject to an
upper limit on a ‘week’s pay’ of £450. The award bears no relation to any
loss suffered by reason of the breach: it is a fixed sum which the tribunal
must award and may not vary.

Example 4
Hyacinth applied for a promotion worth an extra £2,375 per year after tax,
but failed to get it on grounds of her race. She worked for a further six
months after the appointment of a different candidate, and then left for
another job with a different employer. In her new job she earns more than
she would have if she had been promoted.
The tribunal considers that Hyacinth’s financial loss attributable to the
discrimination is limited to six months’ lost increment and awards her
£2,375/2 = £1,187.50 for lost earnings plus £7,000 for injury to feelings
The figure for lost earnings is a matter of simple arithmetic. The question
how much the injury to Hyacinth’s feelings is ‘worth’ in financial terms is
much more difficult: tribunals tend to pick a round figure that ‘feels right’
in the circumstances, although their feelings on the subject will be guided
by previous decisions of the EAT and the Court of Appeal.
Example 5
Hyacinth appeals to the EAT, complaining that the tribunal failed to give
any consideration to her argument that if she had received the promotion
she would have been in a stronger position to negotiate with her current
employer, and would be earning more now. She says a more realistic
estimate of her loss is another £2,000 per year for three years.
Very often tribunals are required to compare the claimant’s situation as it is
with his situation as it might have been had the discrimination (etc) not
occurred. There can be a considerable element of guesswork involved.

Evidence of loss
10.33
Where there is a claim for compensation, evidence of loss should be
carefully prepared. The bulk of the claim will normally be for lost earnings.
Here there are typically three main things to argue about: (i) what the
claimant would have earned in the relevant period if she had not been

dismissed; (ii) what she has earned and/or will earn in the relevant period;
and (iii) what is the relevant period.
10.34
In discrimination cases there will normally be some debate as well about
the appropriate award for injury to feelings.
10.35
You will need a statement about your losses, explaining carefully how
you arrive at the sums claimed in your schedule. You will also need a
bundle of relevant documents: evidence of your actual earnings in your old
job, if there is any dispute about that; evidence of your attempts to mitigate;
receipts for the costs of mitigation, if any; evidence relevant to any pay
rises or promotions you say you would have got if you had remained with
your employer; and so on.

What you would have earned
10.36
This can often be agreed, especially if your entitlements are set out in your
contract of employment or statement of main terms. Sometimes there is
argument about variable benefits: eg whether you would have received a
pay rise if you had not been dismissed, or whether you would have
benefited from a discretionary bonus, and if so, of how much. If there is
disagreement on this, the statement (or, if remedy is going to be dealt with
separately, a remedy statement) should set out the grounds on which you
say you would have received the higher figure. So for example, you might
point out that you had received a pay rise of between three per cent and six
per cent every April since you first worked for the employer; or say that
although the bonus was expressed in your contract to be purely
discretionary, in fact you and your colleagues had always received a bonus
that was calculated as a proportion of their annual salary determined
arithmetically by the performance of the department as a whole over the
previous year. It may be necessary to request performance figures from the
respondent in order to do this kind of calculation; it may also be relevant to
request details of any pay rises awarded to other employees.

What you have earned or will earn: mitigation

10.37
Where there is a claim for lost earnings, there is almost always also a duty
to ‘mitigate’ your loss – that is to say, if you have been dismissed unfairly
or as a result of unlawful discrimination, that doesn’t mean you can now
retire and seek to recover in full what you would have earned up to age 65:
you must do your best to get another job.
10.38
The tribunal will only order the respondent to compensate losses
reasonably incurred. If the tribunal believes that you have failed to take
reasonable steps to mitigate your loss, it will not compensate you for
whatever element of your loss you could reasonably have avoided. This is
often the most contentious aspect of the argument about remedy, and is
worth careful attention.

Heading off criticism of efforts to mitigate
10.39
If your complaint is about the loss of your job, you should start to look for
another job as soon as you reasonably can. If you are too ill, or too upset or
depressed, to look for work straight away, you must see your doctor.
Otherwise, take at least one step towards finding alternative work every
day, and document your job-search carefully. This should include:
making a note of every telephone call;
keeping a copy of every letter and completed application form;
keeping all rejection letters;
making a note of each ‘situations vacant’ column checked;
keeping a copy or clipping of each advertisement responded to;
printing out details of any relevant website visited;
printing out all relevant e-mails sent or received;
keeping notes of any career advice sought or received;
keeping records of any expenses incurred in the job search – travel
tickets, receipts for meals taken away from home, receipts for
photocopying or printing etc.
10.40

The best position to be in at the time of the hearing is to be making a
modest claim for lost earnings because you have got a better-paid job than
before. If that is not achievable, the second best outcome is to have a lowerpaid job. This tends to be regarded by tribunals as convincing evidence that
you are serious about mitigating your loss, so it will maximise your chances
of securing compensation for a substantial period into the future.
10.41
The worst outcome is still to be looking for work at the time of the
hearing. If you are still unavoidably unemployed by the time of the hearing,
you should be armed with a fat file of evidence of mitigation. Here, for
once, sheer length and weight is a virtue: the aim is to deter the respondent
from even attempting to argue that you haven’t done enough to mitigate.
Most respondents faced with a credible 300-page mitigation bundle full of
realistic applications for appropriate jobs will decide to concentrate on other
approaches to damage limitation.
10.42
There is more on the subject of mitigation (including a sample remedy
statement) on the blog that supports this book: see www.etclaims.co.uk.

What is the relevant period?
10.43
This too is often contentious, particularly if you are still out of work at the
time of the hearing. The respondent will seek to persuade the tribunal that
you haven’t tried hard enough, and it shouldn’t be held responsible for lost
earnings for more than a few months after the dismissal. Your aim will be to
persuade the tribunal that there are good reasons why your losses to date are
unavoidable, and, if they are continuing, why they are likely to continue for
a long time into the future. A good mitigation bundle is very helpful here: if
you can show that you have applied unsuccessfully for every suitable job
that has been advertised within reasonable travelling distance from your
home ever since you were dismissed, it will be easier to convince the
tribunal that it is likely to take you a significant further period to find work.
10.44
There is quite a common belief that employment tribunals don’t award
compensation for future loss beyond three or six months. Other things being

equal, that’s not a bad rule of thumb. If there’s no good reason to suppose
that you are going to have particular difficulty getting another job, or that
even if you get another job it will be at a much lower salary than your old
job, but you haven’t in fact got another job by the time of the hearing, the
tribunal hasn’t got much to go on. That’s precisely where a rule of thumb
comes in handy: it helps you out when you don’t know what to do.
10.45
But the other things being equal bit is important. Sometimes other things
are not at all equal. If you really do think that there is some reason why you
are at a serious disadvantage in the labour market, and your career is not
likely to be back on its old track for years if ever, then tell the tribunal all
about it and ask for compensation for the whole of your loss. You’ll be
much better placed to make good a claim of this nature if you have found
another job by the time of the hearing. This is because that fact in itself is a
powerful piece of evidence about your marketability and your likely future
earnings. Where a claimant has not yet got another job at the time of the
hearing, tribunals often assume – perhaps unrealistically – that when they
do get another job, they will match their old earnings, so their loss will
cease at that point. So they make a guess as to how long that will be – and
the guess often is three or six months – and award lost earnings for that
period only.
10.46
If on the other hand you have got another job on significantly lower pay
at the time of the hearing, the tribunal has much more information to go on.
The fact that you have accepted a lower-paid job is a pretty convincing
demonstration that you can’t do better at the moment: certainly the tribunal
will take a lot of persuading that you have deliberately taken a badly paid
job in order to inflate your claim. You can also make more confident and
better-founded predictions about the future. You may be in a position to say,
for example, that you intend to stay in this job for at least two years,
because you don’t want a fragmented CV; or that although this job isn’t
very well paid at the moment, it is sensible for you to stay in it because
there is reason to think you have a strong prospect of promotion in between
three and five years; or that you have been lucky to get a job with hours that
make it possible for you to take a part-time college course to retrain for a
change of career that will allow you to earn better in future – but not for

another five years. If you have plans or expectations of this sort, don’t limit
yourself to claiming a few months’ future loss. It’s important to be realistic,
of course, so don’t – either – make wild claims that you can’t support with
evidence.
10.47
If you’re saying that ill-treatment by your former employer damaged
your health, and because of that you are still too ill to apply for work at all,
or your illness means that you cannot realistically expect to secure work at
his previous level, the tribunal is unlikely to accept this without supporting
medical reports. Bear in mind that in an unfair dismissal case, although you
can’t claim for personal injury caused by the dismissal, illness caused by
the dismissal or surrounding circumstances may provide the explanation for
your failure to mitigate as quickly or as completely as might have been
hoped. In such a case, if the respondent argues that there has been
inadequate mitigation, medical evidence may be necessary.
10.48
Mothers of young children will suffer some of the greatest losses by
reason of dismissal. If you have lost a responsible and demanding job soon
after having your first child, you may have real difficulty getting or keeping
another job at the same level. It’s one thing winning the respect of an
employer in a pressured environment as a single twenty-something who is
able to work all hours, go drinking with colleagues in the evening, and be
back at your desk at 7.30 am the next day. It’s quite another matter doing
the same through morning sickness, ante-natal appointments, maternity
leave, unreliable child-minders, school hours, homework, childhood
illnesses and general parental weariness. If you’ve lost your job at this
critical time of your life, you may find that you have been pushed onto a
‘mummy track’ that can affect the rest of your career.
10.49
You may face arguments from your employer that you’ve made bad
choices in trying to mitigate your loss – especially if you have made an
unsuccessful and expensive attempt at self-employment. But you don’t have
to have made the best possible choices: your employer shouldn’t succeed in
reducing your compensation for a failure to mitigate unless they show that
you have acted unreasonably. Making choices that can be seen – with

hindsight – not to have been the best possible choices is not the same thing
as acting unreasonably.

Injury to feelings
10.50
In a discrimination claim, if there is (and there usually will be) injury to
feelings over and above the pure affront of having suffered discrimination,
it is necessary to spell this out in evidence. You’ll need something more
than a bare assertion that you were upset. If you’re an adviser, it can be
difficult to get this kind of information from claimants in a form in which it
will convince the tribunal, either because the feelings are too painful to talk
about easily, or because they are just not used to describing their emotions
and the effects of their emotions.
10.51
This is a tricky task, because it is important not to put words into your
client’s mouth or suggest ‘right’ answers. At the same time, you may have
to be quite persistent if you are to tease out the real effects of the
discrimination. Bear in mind that individual reactions to discrimination will
differ widely, and not necessarily in proportion to the severity of the
treatment. Some people will be angry, but basically able to brush the
experience off; others will be profoundly upset; others still will become
clinically depressed. Questions it can be helpful to ask include:
How did it make you feel when [xyz] happened?
What did you do?
Did you talk to anyone about it?
Were you tearful?
How long did you spend crying?
Was that the only time it made you cry?
How did you spend the next few days/weeks/months?
Did you go out?
Did you see friends?
Did it affect your relationship with your partner/spouse/family?
Did it affect your sex life?
Did it affect your relationship with your friends?

10.52
If you’re representing yourself, thinking about the answers to these
questions may still help you to put into words the effects the discrimination
has had on you.
10.53
If the upset caused by discrimination is severe, it can be helpful to have
supporting evidence from a family member or friend. Where depression has
resulted, medical evidence will be needed.

Claim everything you can
10.54
Obviously you must not claim any loss that you have not genuinely
suffered, but it is important to identify and claim for every loss that you
have incurred.

Costs of mitigation
10.55
Keep track of the cost of your job search, in postage, printing,
transportation to and from interviews, career guidance etc.

Training
10.56
If you have decided that you need training to enhance your job prospects, or
even re-training for a complete change of career, as long as the tribunal
thinks your decisions reasonable you can recover the cost of this.

Post-dismissal pay rises
10.57
Don’t forget to take account in calculating your loss of any pay rise that you
would have received if you had remained in your old job. You may need to
request information from the respondent for this purpose.

Promotion prospects
10.58

If there is good reason to think that if your employment hadn’t ended when
it did, you would have been promoted into a higher-paid post during the
period of your loss, claim for that too. Think about what evidence you need
to prove this: you may want to look at your career progression over the
previous few years, and your most recent appraisals. You may also want to
get information from the respondent about the progress of comparable
colleagues who were at the same level as you when you left.

All contractual benefits
10.59
Sometimes you will only be talking about wages. But if you have benefits
like private health insurance, gym membership, a company car, subsidised
meals, season ticket loans, and so on, claim for the value of those too.

Pension
10.60
If you had an occupational pension, claim for the loss of that. Sometimes
this will just be a matter of claiming the value of the employers’
contributions for a short period while you were out of work, but sometimes
dismissal will have done much more serious damage to your long-term
pension rights. Make sure you include that in your claim.
10.61
Calculating a substantial pension loss is complicated; start with the
guidance in ELAH para 18.40.

Non-contractual benefits
10.62
Don’t confine yourself to benefits that you were contractually entitled to. If
there are other benefits – tips, discretionary bonuses etc – that you had no
contractual right to but that you probably would have got, claim for those
too.

Grossing up
10.63

If the total compensatory award exceeds £30,000, it should be ‘grossed up’
so that you are fully compensated notwithstanding the effects of any tax on
the award.

Interest
10.64
Don’t forget to include a claim for interest on any discrimination award.

The schedule of loss
10.65
It is a good idea to quantify your loss as early as possible in proceedings.
There are two main reasons for this. First, the earlier the respondent knows
the size of the claim, the greater the chances of realistic negotiations: the
respondent may be more inclined to settle before it has spent substantial
sums of money on legal fees than after.
10.66
Second, if the respondent knows at an early stage what its maximum risk
is, it is better equipped to judge how much it should spend on defending the
claim. If you want to argue later, in opposing a costs application, that the
respondent’s legal costs were disproportionate to the size of the claim, you
will be better placed to do so if you can show the tribunal a schedule of loss
claiming a modest sum that was sent to the respondent before they incurred
any significant costs.
10.67
General guidance on how to quantify claims can be found at chapters 18
and 19 of Employment Law: an adviser’s handbook (10th edn (ELAH)).
Guidance on preparing schedules of loss can be found at

Enforcement
10.68
The tribunal itself has no enforcement powers. For enforcement, you can
take one of two routes. Either you use the services of a High Court
Enforcement Officer (HCEO) by way of what’s called the ACAS and
Employment Tribunal Fast Track; or you register the judgment in the
county court yourself, and make use of the county court’s enforcement
powers.

High Court Enforcement Officers
10.69
For most users of this book, the Fast Track will be more suitable. As its
name suggests, it can be used for enforcement of ACAS settlements as well
as tribunal awards.
10.70
There is a slightly higher initial fee of £60 (compared to £40 for
registering your award in the county court) but that is the only fee, and you
should recover it at the end of the process from your employer. Fill in form
EX727 (go to justice.gov.uk website and type EX727 into the ‘find a court
form’ box on the right hand side of the page) and send it to the address
given for the Registry Trust Ltd at the bottom of page 6, together with a
cheque for £60 payable to HM Courts and Tribunal Service and the original
or a certified copy of the tribunal order making the award to you. You can
apply for remission of this fee, if you are on benefits or a very low wage: if
so, you will need to include form EX160 and the accompanying evidence.
10.71

The HCEO will then deal with enforcement for you, and there will be no
further fees that you have to pay. The HCEO gets paid by adding their fees
on top of what your employer owes you, and recovering both together: that
means they have a strong incentive to succeed in the enforcement.

Register in the county court
10.72
Alternatively, you can register the tribunal award in the county court
yourself using form N322A. This costs an initial fee of £40 (again subject
to remission if you are eligible), but there will be further fees to pay later on
if you need to use bailiffs, apply for an attachment of earnings or a charging
order, etc. You file a copy of the award together with form N322A at the
County Court. The form is available from any county court, or from HM
Courts & Tribunals Service website. A fee is charged for registration,
currently £40. The fee will be added to the registered judgment, so once the
award is registered the respondent will owe you the original amount plus
£40.
10.73
Once a tribunal award is registered it becomes a County Court Judgment
(CCJ). This has two effects. First, the existence of a CCJ will sometimes be
enough on its own to persuade a respondent to pay up. To many people a
CCJ is real in a way that a tribunal judgment is not. CCJs also show up on
credit checks and an outstanding CCJ can have grave effects on the creditworthiness of an individual or company. Secondly, once a CCJ exists, it can
be enforced in the same way as any other court judgments.
10.74
County courts cover a set geographical area and will not register
judgments relating to cases from outside that area. It is the respondent’s
address that determines the appropriate court. Court addresses can be found
through the court service website. It’s sensible to telephone the court to
check it is the right one.
10.75
The county court has a number of powers of enforcement:

Order to obtain information requiring the respondent to attend court to
answer questions about his finances and ability to pay.
Warrant of execution using bailiffs to recover goods which can be sold
to cover the debt.
Third party debt order ordering somebody who owes the respondent
money (in practice, usually their bank, which owes them money any
time they have an account that is in credit) to pay the relevant amount
of it to the claimant.
Attachment of earnings order ordering the respondent’s employer to
pay a portion of his wages to the claimant.
Charging order securing the debt against land owned by the
respondent.
The court will not pursue any of these options on its own. To use them, you
will need to make further applications. This will require fees, which will
also be added to the judgment debt.

Enforcement of non-ACAS settlements
10.76
To enforce a non-ACAS settlement, you will need to bring a civil case in
the county court. Although this sounds intimidating, the case will normally
be straightforward, since all you need to prove is that an agreement was
reached, but the money has not been paid. This will create a CCJ and lead
into the enforcement system described above. The easiest way to do this is
probably by using ‘money claim online’.3
10.77
A full discussion of enforcement proceedings is outside the scope of this
book. Further information is available from the Court Service website and
county courts.

Insolvency
10.78
Respondents frequently say that they are unable to pay because they are
insolvent. Such statements should be taken with a pinch of salt. It is easy to
check whether an individual or company has been made bankrupt of

insolvent. Personal bankruptcies are registered with the Insolvency Service.
Companies House records will show a company’s insolvency. In each case,
the information is available on the relevant agency’s website.4
10.79
If the employer is insolvent, some of the award may be recovered
through the National Insurance Fund. This fund covers a limited amount of
unpaid wages, notice pay, redundancy payments and the basic award in
unfair dismissal. Details of the scheme and instructions for applying may be
found on the Insolvency Service website. See also ELAH para 18.69.
10.80
Further money may be recovered through the insolvency process, but
employee debts are far down the list of creditors and claimants will rarely
see much money once the other debts have been paid.
10.81
If the employer is not registered as insolvent, don’t abandon enforcement
proceedings unless you’re convinced they will be fruitless. It is certainly
sensible to ask searching questions about why – if the employer is insolvent
– they are not registered as such.
10.82
One method that unscrupulous employers may use is to put one company
into insolvency, and then create another company to do much the same
work. This is known as a ‘phoenix company’. This is a difficult tactic to
counter. In theory, it may be possible to enforce against either the directors
or the new company, but in practice this is likely to require high court
litigation and a specialist legal team – resources that are unlikely to be
available and whose cost is likely to dwarf the original award. If you think
this has happened, you should consider informing Companies House and
HM Revenue and Customs. Companies House may investigate the
directors’ conduct. And HM Revenue and Customs may investigate
whether tax evasion has occurred in the process.

11.39 Reconsideration and appeal

The decision
11.1
The decision may be given orally at the end of the hearing. You will also
get a written judgment, either on the day or sent out afterwards. The
judgment will simply state which party has won, who has to pay what in
compensation or costs, and may include a declaration (for example, that one
party has discriminated against the other). The tribunal will not send out
written reasons unless one of the parties requests them. A party wishing to
appeal must have written reasons.
11.2
If you have lost your case, and you are not represented, it is probably
worth asking for written reasons in order to be able to think about (and get
advice on) whether or not to appeal. Even if there is no question of an
appeal, written reasons may make it easier to understand the result. The
request can be made either at the hearing or within 14 days after the written
judgment is sent out. If you request written reasons at the hearing, you
should make an immediate note of this.
11.3
Alternatively, the tribunal may wish to take time to consider and write its
decision, in which case the parties may be sent away not knowing who has
won and who has lost. This is called ‘reserving’ a decision.
11.4
If the tribunal reserves its decision, it will always send out written
reasons for the decision. Reserved decisions are usually sent out within four
to six weeks of the hearing. If a decision has not been received within about
eight weeks of the hearing, it is worth making inquiries: occasionally the
tribunal makes a mistake and sends reasons to one party but not the other, or
to the wrong address, or records that it has sent out reasons when it has not;
and there is always the possibility of postal failure. Because of the strict
time limits for appealing, if reasons have not been received it is important
to find out promptly whether the tribunal believes it has sent them.

Costs and preparation time orders
11.5

In certain limited circumstances the tribunal will order one party to
reimburse the other’s legal costs of fighting the case (this is a costs order) or
to pay the other a sum of money to compensate for the time that they or
their non-lawyer advisers have spent preparing the case (this is called a
preparation time order). Unlike the ordinary courts, employment tribunals
do not routinely order the unsuccessful party to pay the successful party’s
costs. The tribunal’s power to award costs is much more restricted.
11.6
Costs and preparation time orders are mutually exclusive. If you are
represented at your hearing (whether by a lawyer or a non-lawyer), you may
be able to claim costs. If you represent yourself or are represented by a nonlawyer, you may be able to claim a preparation time order. The same applies
in reverse. If your employer is represented, they may apply for costs. If they
act for themselves or are represented by a non-lawyer, they may apply for a
preparation time order.
11.7
This creates the odd rule that the only time a party cannot apply for
reimbursement relating to their own preparation is when they are legally
represented.
11.8
The procedure rules state that if the tribunal is satisfied that a party has
‘acted vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably, … or
any claim or response had no reasonable prospect of success’,1 then it shall
consider making a costs or preparation time order. In practice tribunals
almost never consider such an order unless an application is made.
11.9
Applications are usually made, if at all, after the decision is announced,
and are usually decided immediately. This means that if you intend to make
a costs application, or if you fear that a costs application may be made by
the respondent, you should go to the substantive hearing equipped with all
the information you need to support or, as the case may be, resist the
application.

When to apply for costs or a preparation time order
11.10

You can make an application if the respondent has acted unreasonably, etc,
in the way it has conducted the proceedings, or where it has caused a
postponement or adjournment of the hearing. In general, the application
will have a greater chance of success if you have previously warned the
respondent that you consider its conduct unreasonable and are
contemplating a costs application, but sometimes there will be unreasonable
conduct at the hearing that you have not foreseen.
11.11
Typical grounds for a costs application include:
insistence on running a misconceived defence, for example, that the
claimant was not an employee when she very clearly was, or that there
had not been a TUPE transfer when it was clear that the undertaking in
which the claimant was employed had retained its identity in the hands
of the transferee, or that a claimant with a prosthetic leg did not have a
disability for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010;
refusal to agree a realistic settlement proposal;
persistent failure to provide documents or information ordered by the
tribunal, or to exchange witness statements when ordered;
production of a large volume of new documentation on the day of the
hearing;
excessive requests for disclosure, further information or written
answers;
making new allegations against you on the day of the hearing;
late amendment of its response;
abusive letters or telephone calls or attempts to intimidate you into
dropping the claim;
attempts to intimidate your witnesses or to get them to change their
evidence;
unfounded allegations against you, your advisers or the tribunal.

Arguing for a costs or preparation time order
11.12
Sometimes the conduct in question will be a single unreasonable act, but
often it will be necessary to take the tribunal through a history of the

communications between the parties in order to demonstrate that the
respondent has been unreasonable. If that is the case it is prudent to collate
a separate bundle of documents relevant to the costs application so that the
tribunal can quickly and conveniently be shown the sequence of events.
This is where a history of conspicuously patient and forbearing letters is
important: the unreasonableness of the respondent will be displayed to
much better advantage against a background of consistent courtesy on your
part. Tribunals will often be reluctant to listen to lengthy complaints about
the conduct of the proceedings, so it is unwise to embark on this kind of
application unless there are good grounds for it. If there are, a degree of
persistence may be needed.
11.13
The fact of unreasonable (etc) conduct by one party gives the tribunal
power to make a costs order in favour of the other party. Once that fact is
established, however, it does not follow that the tribunal must make a costs
order. Tribunals quite often make this mistake. And as this is a basis on
which a costs order could be challenged on appeal it is sensible to remind
the tribunal that it has a discretion once it is persuaded that it has power to
award costs.
11.14
Factors that can influence the tribunal in its exercise of discretion
include:
the seriousness of the unreasonable conduct relied on;
the degree of inconvenience and/or expense caused to you;
warnings that you have given the respondent about the possibility of a
costs application;
the conduct of the party seeking costs;
the means of either party.
11.15
When it comes to an argument that the respondent’s defence was
misconceived, the tribunal may suggest that unless it was clear on the
papers that the defence was doomed, it cannot be said to have been
misconceived. This is a mistake: the point is what the respondent knew or
should have known. If the employer’s response to the claim and witness

statements look convincing, but its witnesses when they give evidence
simply do not back what has been put in their statements, then the defence
may still have been misconceived: the employer after all had access to its
own witnesses before the tribunal did, and should have made sure their
statements reflected what they believed to be the truth.

Preparation time orders
11.16
Although the discretion whether to make a preparation time order is
expressed in the same terms and is exercised in the same way as the
discretion to make a costs order, there are some features of this power that
are quite distinct.
11.17
First, it should be noted that unlike a costs order, a preparation time order
cannot be made in respect of the time spent by a party or his or her adviser
at the hearing itself. It is difficult to understand the policy behind this: often
the consequence of unreasonable conduct is that a hearing is extended. If
you are paying for legal representation you may be able to recover the cost
of the additional day(s) in tribunal; but if you are representing yourself, or
are represented by an unqualified adviser (whether or not for free) you will
not.
11.18
Second, preparation time orders do not reimburse the receiving party for
money spent on the preparation of a case, but for the time spent at a fixed
hourly rate. The rate is £33 per hour in 2013, and will increase by £1 per
hour annually on 6th April.
11.19
If you are represented by someone for free, this has the odd result that
you can recover £33 per hour for time your representative has spent
preparing your case – provided your representative is not a qualified lawyer.
If you are represented for free by a qualified lawyer, you will, ironically, be
in a weaker position. You will not be eligible for a preparation time order
and, since you have not incurred any costs, you cannot get a costs order
either.

The amount of a costs or preparation time order

11.20
If you are seeking a costs or preparation time order, you should be ready to
give the tribunal clear and credible information about the costs you have
incurred or about the time you have spent preparing for the hearing. This
should not present any particular difficulties if you are paying for legal
representation and have incurred actual legal costs. But if you are either
representing yourself or being represented for free, you are likely to have
difficulty quantifying the time spent unless you and/or your advisers have
kept a running note of this.

Resisting a costs or preparation time order
No reasonable prospect of success
11.21
You should argue that your claim did have prospects of success unless at
some point before the hearing you either knew or should have known that it
didn’t. The fact that the claim has failed is not enough: it needs to have been
doomed to failure, and evidently so. It may be helpful to remind the tribunal
that it would have been open to the respondent to invite the tribunal to list
the case for a preliminary hearing and order you to pay a deposit under rule
39 if it considered that the case was self-evidently hopeless. If the
respondent did not do this, then its assertion now that the case was
misconceived may be opportunistic.

Refusal of a settlement offer
11.22
If the respondent applies for costs on the strength of a previous offer of
settlement headed ‘without prejudice save as to costs’, you may be assisted
by Kopel v Safeway Stores plc2 which makes it clear that claimants in the
employment tribunal will not be penalised in costs merely for failing to do
better after a hearing than they could have done by accepting an offer of
settlement. Failing to predict the tribunal’s award accurately should not be
regarded as unreasonable in itself; refusing an offer of the maximum the
tribunal could reasonably be expected to award may be.

Postponement or adjournment

11.23
The power to award costs of a postponement or adjournment is confined to
the cost of the additional work required by reason of the postponement or
adjournment. If you are resisting a costs application, take a sceptical view
of this. The obvious consequence of a postponement is that preparation for
the hearing has been done early, but it does not necessarily follow that
additional preparation has to be done. It is different of course if the case is
adjourned after parties and lawyers have arrived at the hearing: then,
inevitably, there will be additional costs.

The claimant’s means
11.24
Tribunals have power to take the paying party’s means into account when
deciding whether and if so at what level to make a costs order. It follows
that if you think there is a significant risk of a costs order against you, you
should go to the tribunal with evidence about your savings, income and
expenditure.

The respondent’s choice of representation
11.25
If the respondent argues before the hearing that your case is misconceived,
and/or your total award cannot exceed a certain modest sum that is being
offered by way of settlement, then a real question may arise whether it
made sense for them to instruct solicitors at all. If the respondent has
chosen to instruct city solicitors at £250 or £350 an hour and specialist
counsel at £800 or £1,000 per hearing day on a case which, it says, never
had any real chance of success, you can quite sensibly suggest that their
choice of legal adviser was disproportionate. The employment tribunals are
after all designed to be accessible to lay people. If the respondent takes the
view that a case had no reasonable prospect of success or was incapable of
resulting in an award of more than £1,000 or so, then a fair question is:
‘Why did you need a team of highly paid specialist lawyers? Why could a
personnel officer not deal with this?’

Changing the judgment

11.26
There are three ways that a judgment can be changed or altered after it has
been sent out to the parties.
11.27
For minor clerical or uncontroversial arithmetic errors, a certificate of
correction should be requested from the employment judge who heard the
case. Curiously, there is no time limit for applying for a certificate of
correction.
11.28
Where there is reason to ask the tribunal that decided the case to look
again at its decision – because new evidence has become available, for
example, or because one party was unaware of the date of the hearing –
then an application should be made to the same tribunal to reconsider its
decision. Where the tribunal has made an error of law in coming to its
decision, there is a right of appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal: see
later chapters on appeals.

Applying for a certificate of correction
11.29
All that is required is a letter to the tribunal explaining the error and making
the request.

Dear Madam

Re: Pauline Phelps v Sharpe, Gentleman & Co Solicitors
I should be grateful if you would put before Mr Ruby, who heard this case
on 21–23 September 2014, my request for a certificate of correction. The
judgment reads at paragraph 2 ‘the respondent is ordered to pay the
claimant £57.65.’ It is clear from the rest of the judgment and the reasons
that the correct sum is £57,653.34. £10,000 is awarded for injury to feelings
(see paragraph 46 of the written reasons) and £47,653.34 for lost earnings
(see paragraph 49 of the written reasons).
Yours faithfully

Applying for reconsideration of a decision
11.30
A tribunal may consider its judgment where it decides that it is in the
interests of justice to do so. Case management orders cannot (because they
are not judgments). But the tribunal can, and from time to time does, make
a new case management order that overrides an old one.
11.31
Although this is a wide discretion, tribunals are generally reluctant to
reconsider their decisions. They are concerned that, in general, judgments
should have some finality and bring claims to a close – allowing parties to
move on.
11.32
It is therefore futile to apply for reconsideration simply on the basis that
the tribunal has made the wrong decision or believed the wrong witnesses.
You need to be able to identify either a serious problem with the way the
decision has been made or some significant change of circumstances since
the decision was made.
11.33
Examples of when reconsideration may be appropriate include:
Example 1

You did not receive notice of the hearing, and the case was dismissed in
your absence. For reconsideration, you would need to satisfy the tribunal
that you genuinely did not receive the notice of hearing. That will be easiest
if the tribunal’s file shows that it was wrongly addressed, but if you are in
this position you should not assume that you will be disbelieved if the
problem is simply that some of your post went astray. If you do persuade
the tribunal that you genuinely did not receive the notice of hearing, the
tribunal should revoke its decision and list the case for a new hearing date.
Example 2
You failed to attend the hearing, although you knew when it was, for urgent
and compelling reasons. If you did not explain your absence at the time,
your reasons for that failure would have to be very compelling indeed. A
serious accident on the way to the tribunal should be sufficient, for
example, or a call to attend hospital to be with a seriously injured spouse or
child.
Example 3
You were dismissed for redundancy. You argued at the hearing that there
was no genuine redundancy situation, but your employer had not replaced
you and the tribunal accepted that your post was redundant. A few days
after the hearing, you saw your old job advertised in the local paper. Here
there is new evidence – which was not available at the time of the hearing –
which gives the tribunal reason to reassess its conclusion that the
redundancy was genuine.
11.34
An application for reconsideration must be made within 14 days of the date
when the decision was sent to the parties. There is a fee of £100 in a type A
claim or £350 in a type B claim. You do not pay the fee in advance. The
tribunal will issue a Notice to Pay after they receive the application.
11.35

When an application for reconsideration is received by the tribunal, the
judge who heard the case will decide whether or not to reconsider the
judgment.
11.36
If the judge thinks that there is no reasonable prospect of the original
decision being changed the application goes no further and the parties are
informed that reconsideration has been refused.
11.37
Otherwise, the other parties will be asked for their views on the
application and whether it can be determined without a hearing. A
reconsideration hearing will then be listed, unless the judge concludes that
one is not necessary in the interests of justice. If a hearing is not necessary,
the reconsideration will be done on the papers.
11.38
If the tribunal does reconsider, it will be done, if practicable, by the
original tribunal. A reconsideration is essentially a request to the same
tribunal to think again about the case. It will rarely be useful to apply for a
reconsideration unless there is a real possibility that the tribunal might
change its mind.

decision
The Regional Secretary
London Central Employment Tribunal
Ground floor, Victory House
Kingsway
London WC2B 6EX
17 August 2014
Dear Madam
Mike Allen v ADAL Ltd
I should be grateful if you would put before Mr Colt, who heard this case,
my application for a reconsideration of the tribunal’s decision of 21 July

2014 under rule 71 of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure on the grounds that:
1. new evidence has become available since the hearing which was not
available, and could not have been foreseen, at the time of the hearing; and
2. therefore the interests of justice require a reconsideration.
The claim was of unfair dismissal. The respondent had dismissed Mr Allen,
giving redundancy as the reason and alleging a downturn in business that
forced them to reduce their staff costs. Mr Allen alleged that his post was
not genuinely redundant, and that the real reason for his dismissal was that
there had been personal friction between him and his manager.
The tribunal’s decision recorded that the evidence of a downturn in business
was equivocal, but (at paragraph 24) that it was clear that the respondent
had reduced its management team by one with a cost saving of some
£57,000 per year. On the basis of this the tribunal accepted that there had
been a genuine redundancy situation, and proceeded to find that Mr Allen’s
selection for redundancy had been fair.
On 29 July Mr Allen received anonymously in the post a copy of an
advertisement in the Sutton Echo for an ‘Engineering Process Manager’.
I enclose a copy. The post appears to be Mr Allen’s old job.
I suggest that in light of this new evidence there are grounds for a concern
that the tribunal may have been materially misled by the respondent as to
the reason for Mr Allen’s dismissal.
Yours faithfully
Natalie Cummings

Reconsideration and appeal
11.39
If a decision contains an error of law it can be appealed. The process of
appealing is dealt with in the next two chapters.
11.40
It is rarely, if ever, appropriate to raise errors of law by way of
application for reconsideration. Similarly, anything other than a matter of

law is (if anything) a matter for reconsideration. However, there will
sometimes be borderline cases where it is difficult to decide whether to ask
the tribunal to reconsider its own decision, or to appeal the decision to the
Employment Appeal Tribunal.
11.41
Prior to the introduction of fees, the best course in these situations was to
do both, but to inform the EAT of the reconsideration application and ask it
not to take any action on the appeal until the reconsideration has been
determined. This is still probably the best approach if you are entitled to fee
remission.
11.42
If not, you face an unpleasant dilemma. Applying for a reconsideration
will probably cost you £350 – which you will lose if the tribunal refuses to
reconsider because they regard your application as better suited for an
appeal. Appealing will cost £400 – with an extra £1,200 to pay before the
hearing. This is a lot of money to risk, especially given that it may be
unnecessary if the tribunal is willing to reconsider.
11.43
One approach is to apply for reconsideration as soon as possible, in the
hope that it can be resolved before the appeal deadline looms, allowing you
to appeal if necessary. This is worth considering, but bear in mind that the
EAT takes a strict approach to their time limit. It will not extend it on the
basis that you delayed waiting for the reconsideration decision.
11.44
Unfortunately, you will often be in the position where you either have to
pay both fees, or take your best guess and hope you got it right. This is
unsatisfactory, but it is the current position under the rules.

Introduction: Employment Appeal Tribunal
12.1
If you think the employment tribunal has got the wrong answer in your case
because of an error of law, you can appeal to the Employment Appeal
Tribunal (EAT). This chapter explains what an ‘error of law’ means, how to
go about starting an appeal, and what to do to prepare for the hearing. The
next chapter deals with the EAT hearing itself.

Terminology
12.2
The side that appeals to the EAT is technically known as the appellant, and
the other party is the respondent (that is, the party who responds) to the
appeal. This can get confusing, because the respondent to the appeal is not
necessarily the same person as the respondent to the original claim. If the
employer (who was the respondent at the employment tribunal) appeals to
the EAT, the former employer is now the appellant and the employee
becomes the respondent. For this reason, the EAT prefers parties to stick to

the terms used before the employment tribunal and refer to the employee as
the claimant and the employer as the respondent, even if the appeal is
brought by the employer.
12.3
In a book of this nature (as opposed to in a particular case) it is
sometimes necessary to generalise about what is required of those who are
challenging the decision of the tribunal, and those who are seeking to
uphold it, so that approach is not followed here. We use ‘appellant’ to refer
to the party who is challenging the employment tribunal’s decision, and the
term ‘respondent’ to refer to the party (even if this is the employee) who is
seeking to uphold the tribunal’s decision. In the precedents, the parties are
either referred to by name, or as ‘the employee’ and ‘the employer’ or ‘the
company’, ‘the hospital’, etc.

Free representation before the EAT
12.4
The factors governing the availability of free representation operate
differently before the employment tribunal and the EAT. If you cannot
afford to pay for representation, you will have a better chance of finding
someone to act for free if you understand a bit about how this works.
12.5
There are two factors. The first is that appeals are normally much shorter
than employment tribunal hearings. This is because as a rule no witnesses
will be heard, and because the questions on which the EAT will hear an
appeal are narrowly defined. Appeals rarely last more than a day, and most
are dealt with in half a day or less. As a result, preparation for an EAT case
is normally much lighter than for a first instance case: witnesses do not
have to be interviewed, statements do not have to be prepared, documents
do not have to be requested and disclosed, the hearing bundle will be much
shorter, and so on. This means that offering free representation on an appeal
is less daunting in terms of work for the lawyer who makes the offer.
12.6
The other factor is double-edged. This is that appearances before the
EAT, which is the next step up the legal hierarchy, tends to be regarded by
representatives both as more challenging and more interesting than

appearing in the employment tribunals. Hearings are often presided over by
High Court judges, advocates stand to make their submissions, and
proceedings are superficially more formal. Some advisers who conduct
cases routinely and skilfully in the employment tribunals lack the
confidence to appear at the EAT and may be unwilling to take cases to
appeal because they feel (although unqualified advisers are allowed to
appear there and often do) that the EAT is the preserve of barristers and
solicitors. But the other side is that some advocates will be more willing to
take on appeals for free because they provide valuable – and comparatively
rare – experience.
12.7
Both of these factors mean that if you have failed to secure free
representation at first instance, you should not necessarily assume that it
follows that you won’t get free representation on an appeal. It is worth
asking again at this stage, especially if the appeal raises a question that
could be of general importance to other claimants in the future.
12.8
It is worth mentioning two specific sources of free representation at the
EAT: the Employment Lawyers Appeals Advice Scheme (ELAAS) and the
Employment Appeals Representation Service (EARS).
12.9
The ELAAS provides representation by barristers and solicitors at
preliminary hearings. This cannot be directly accessed by claimants and is
not guaranteed, and for that reason should probably – although the quality
of the representation is usually very high – be treated as a last resort. Where
there is a preliminary hearing (as to which, see para 13.16), parties who
have no representative on record with the EAT as acting for them may be
offered the assistance of an ELAAS adviser. The ELAAS adviser will be at
the EAT on the day to advise and represent if appropriate. He will have had
the papers a few days in advance, but will not be able to meet the client
before the day of the hearing and will not be able to take on conduct of the
case. If the case then goes to a full hearing, there should be an opportunity
to be referred to the Free Representation Unit and/or the Bar Pro Bono Unit
at this point also.
12.10

EARS aims to provide assistance in full appeals, where there hasn’t been
a preliminary hearing. When a case is listed for a full hearing, and one of
the parties appears to be unrepresented, the EAT will write to them alerting
them to the scheme and enclosing a form to complete if they would like to
apply for free representation. This form is then sent to EARS, which is run
by the Free Representation Unit and Bar Pro Bono Unit – who will look for
a volunteer to assist. If a volunteer is found they will then conduct the
appeal from that point and appear on your behalf in the hearing.
12.11
Both ELAAS and EARS only become relevant once an appeal has been
lodged. For advice on appeal or its drafting, it is worth applying directly to
the Bar Pro Bono Unit.
12.12
The greater availability of free representation in the EAT, compared with
the tribunal, means that it can be a useful measure of the strength of the
appeal. At the tribunal level, a failure to get free representation only means
that there are many more cases than there is help available. At the EAT, if
serious efforts have been made to find free representation without success,
this is more likely to indicate that the appeal is not a strong one. There are
exceptions, but in general it is not too difficult to find free representation for
reasonably arguable appeals to the EAT.

The EAT’s composition and powers
12.13
The EAT is governed by the Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993 (as
amended subsequently). The current version of the rules is available on the
EAT website. There is also a practice direction giving more detailed
instructions on how to run an appeal. A copy of this will be sent to anyone
who presents an appeal. If you’re thinking of appealing to the EAT, it’s a
good idea to take 20 minutes or so to read through the current rules and
practice direction so as to have an idea, in broad outline, of how the process
works and where to find specific powers.
12.14
The EAT is composed in a similar way to an employment tribunal, with a
judge supported by two lay members, one with a background in the trade

union movement and the other having management experience. The
presiding judge will be either a circuit judge or a High Court judge with
employment law experience. Where a case in the tribunal was heard by a
judge sitting alone, the EAT will usually consist of a judge sitting alone as
well.
12.15
Some preliminary judicial decisions on paper are taken by the Registrar,
who is the person to whom correspondence with the EAT should normally
be addressed. The EAT also employs clerks who look after the
administrative side of running cases. Any given appeal will be assigned to a
particular clerk, whose initials will be the last two or three letters of the case
number assigned by the EAT. The clerks are not lawyers and cannot be
expected to give legal advice, but they can often provide helpful guidance
on practical matters.

What kind of appeal will the EAT hear?
12.16
Tribunals hear tens of thousands of cases every year. In each case at least
one side (and sometimes both) will be unhappy with the outcome. Yet only
a few hundred appeals reach a full hearing in the EAT every year. This is
because the right to appeal to the EAT is a narrow and limited one. There’s
no automatic right to challenge any part of the first decision that you
disagree with. Instead, the EAT will hear appeals only on questions of law.
Unfortunately, it’s not obvious what this means.
12.17
To understand what the EAT will and will not do, it is helpful to
understand why the EAT is confident that it knows best on certain kinds of
questions, and why on others it has a strong inclination to defer to the
employment tribunal. The point that disappointed claimants often find
difficult to understand is that there is built into the system an acceptance
that tribunals will sometimes get the wrong answer, and this won’t always
be able to be corrected. Justice is not always done in the employment
tribunals, any more than in any other court.
12.18

If there’s a disagreement between the EAT and the employment tribunal
about what the law is – what a certain provision in the legislation means, for
example, or what is the effect of previous decisions of the EAT or higher
courts – then the EAT will impose its view. The law is to be found in
legislation and law reports. The EAT has equal access to these materials
and, as the senior judicial body, can interpret them more authoritatively.
12.19
But when it comes to deciding which witnesses are telling the truth,
whether one party or another has acted fairly or reasonably, or exercising a
discretion about what it is just to do in all the circumstances, the EAT is at a
disadvantage. The employment tribunal has heard the witnesses give their
evidence; it has observed their demeanour when they were questioned,
heard their hesitations and their tone of voice, it has had various
opportunities to judge their character. It has seen the whole bundle of
documents, of which the EAT is unlikely to see more than a small sample. It
also has access to a great wealth of nuance in the case that the EAT – which,
except in very rare cases, does not hear witnesses at all, and will certainly
not have heard all the evidence that the tribunal has heard – lacks. It will
have built up, from hearing the evidence of countless employees, managers,
personnel officers, etc, in other cases, a broad experience and ‘feel’ for how
employers and employees behave and how it is reasonable to expect them
to behave. It is altogether closer to the coal face than the EAT.
12.20
For these reasons, the EAT approaches decisions of the employment
tribunal in the latter category with great deference, and will not interfere
unless they are very clearly wrong.
12.21
Almost all of the EAT’s decisions are available online. It is worth reading
a random cross-section of these. This should give you some sense of how
the EAT does its job.

Perversity
12.22
To attack a finding of fact it will be necessary to show that there was no
evidence at all to support the finding, or that the evidence was so thin and

implausible that no reasonable tribunal could have accepted it. To attack an
inference or an exercise of discretion, it will need to be shown that no
reasonable tribunal could have drawn that inference or exercised the
discretion in that way: in other words, that the decision was ‘perverse’.
12.23
This is a tough test, and successful perversity appeals are rare. This is
often hard for claimants to accept. The outcome likely to make you feel
most aggrieved is having been disbelieved when you have told the truth.
Losing on a legal technicality may well be less painful. Unfortunately, it is
the legal technicality that is likely to be appealable, and the tribunal’s wrong
assessment of your truthfulness that will not. Perversity appeals are
unpopular with the EAT and very few of them succeed.

Bias appeals
12.24
The only ground of appeal less popular with the EAT than perversity is bias.
This presents two challenges. The first is to approach the question whether
to appeal on grounds of bias with great caution. Bias should never be
inferred simply from the result. If your reasoning amounts to ‘They found
against me when I was clearly right so they must have been biased’, your
appeal on grounds of bias will fail.
12.25
More often, your perception that the tribunal was biased will be based on
their manner in conducting the hearing, subtle differences in the way they
addressed counsel for the respondent on the one hand and you or your
representative on the other, hostile body language, signs of boredom or
exasperation when you were speaking, and so on. These impressions may
be compelling at the time, and they may in fact be signs of bias. But they
are an extremely difficult basis for an appeal: there will be no record of
them, and the tribunal and the respondent will almost certainly deny that
anything was amiss. A detailed analysis of the tribunal’s body language will
be more likely to convince the EAT that you are paranoid than that the
tribunal was biased. An appeal on this kind of basis, too, will almost always
fail.
12.26

It’s worth emphasising this. You may be quite sure that the tribunal
treated you unfairly, and was biased against you, and you may be right.
Most tribunals make an honest attempt to get the right answer on the basis
of the evidence they hear; but they are only made up of human beings. Like
all other human beings in history, the human beings who hear your case will
have their own mix of neuroses and prejudices and preconceptions. If
you’re unlucky, those can operate quite unfairly to your disadvantage. You
can come out of your hearing with a wholly justifiable feeling that you have
been very unfairly treated – and still have no arguable basis for a bias
appeal. Don’t kid yourself that if you keep fighting long enough, justice
must prevail in the end: it may not.
12.27
On the other hand, there will sometimes (though very rarely) be grounds
to complain of bias or an appearance of bias that are both real, and
demonstrable. Here it will be necessary to face down the EAT’s reluctance
to entertain the appeal. If the allegation is based on what a member of the
tribunal said in the course of the hearing, then it will be very difficult to
proceed unless either the other party or the tribunal, or both, agree what was
said. This places an emphasis on note-taking at the hearing. If something is
said that appears to indicate bias, the best course is to write it down and
then immediately read back the note of what was said and ask the tribunal
to confirm that the note is accurate; and to make a note too that that
confirmation was received. This will make it very difficult for the tribunal
or the other party to deny subsequently that the offending remark was made.
12.28
It will very rarely be possible to deduce bias from the decision itself. But
tribunals do occasionally betray a fixed unwillingness to contemplate the
possibility that a respondent witness could have lied simply because of his
status or importance in the employer organisation. In these cases it may be
possible – and if it is possible, it will normally be preferable – to put the
appeal on grounds of perversity, or failure adequately to explain the
decision.
12.29
There are specific rules at paragraph 13 of the EAT Practice Direction
2013 as to the procedures that will be followed if an allegation of bias or
other improper conduct of a hearing is to be made. Any claimant basing an

appeal on such grounds must take care to follow these. There is a warning
at paragraph 11.6.3 that unsuccessful pursuit of such an appeal may put the
appellant at risk of an order for costs.
12.30
By rule 34A of the Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993, the EAT
may make a costs order where it appears that ‘any proceedings brought by
the paying party were unnecessary, improper or vexatious or misconceived
or that there has been unreasonable delay or other unreasonable conduct in
the bringing or conducting of proceedings by the paying party’. In practice
the EAT rarely makes costs awards and they are rarely a serious risk except
in bias cases. The EAT will see an accusation of bias as a serious allegation
and one should not be made without evidence. However, it is not
unreasonable or improper, without more, to bring an ultimately
unsuccessful bias appeal.

Appeals on preliminary or procedural matters
12.31
It is not just final decisions of the employment tribunal that are open to
appeal: sometimes you may wish to appeal a decision of the tribunal on a
preliminary point, or on procedural matters. The latter are often referred to
as ‘interlocutory’ decisions, and an ‘interlocutory appeal’ is an appeal on
this kind of decision. The following are some examples of each kind of
decisions that a claimant might wish to appeal.
12.32
Preliminary substantive decisions:
a decision that the claimant was not an employee and the tribunal there
fore lacks jurisdiction;
a decision that a complaint was not presented in time;
a refusal to extend time for a complaint;
a decision that the claimant does not have sufficient continuous service
to complain of unfair dismissal;
a decision that the claimant was not disabled within the meaning of the
Equality Act 2010.
12.33

These are all substantive decisions that can be appealed in the same way as
final decisions after a full hearing. No special considerations apply, except
that it is important that if any of these preliminary issues is heard first, and
full hearing of some part of the claim follows some weeks or months later,
any appeal against the preliminary decision must be started within 42 days
of promulgation of that first judgment.
12.34
Interlocutory decisions:
a refusal to permit the claimant to amend the claim;
a decision to permit the respondent to present a late response;
a decision to permit the respondent to amend the response;
a refusal to postpone a hearing;
a refusal to order the respondent to provide written answer further
information or disclosure of particular documents;
a refusal to make adjustments to arrangements of the hearing for the
benefit of a disabled claimant;
a refusal to order the attendance of a witness;
a refusal to strike out the employer’s response;
a refusal to give a direction for expert evidence;
a refusal to hear an argument on a procedural application on a
particular occasion;
a decision to conduct a hearing in private, or not to.
12.35
These kinds of decisions are difficult to appeal because of the broad
discretion that the tribunal has to manage the procedural aspects of the case.
The EAT won’t interfere just because it would have exercised any
discretion differently: again, it will have to be persuaded that the tribunal’s
approach demonstrates an error of law.
12.36
There are three typical directions of attack on a decision of this nature.
The first is that the tribunal didn’t accept that it had power to do what it was
asked to do at all: here the ground of appeal is not that the tribunal
exercised its discretion wrongly, but that it did not exercise it at all because
it didn’t believe that it had it to exercise. Suppose, for example, the claimant

points out that there is a witness employed by the respondent who has
highly relevant evidence and from whom the tribunal may wish to hear, and
invites the tribunal to call the witness and make him or her available for
cross-examination by either side. If the tribunal’s response is that it
considers that this will extend proceedings and it does not believe it is
necessary or proportionate, it will be almost impossible to attack that
decision on appeal. But if the tribunal’s response is to say that it is for the
parties to call witnesses and the tribunal has no power to do what has been
asked, that’s a clear error of law and the tribunal has not exercised the
discretion that it undoubtedly had.
12.37
The second and third kinds of attack are closely related. One is that the
tribunal has exercised its discretion without taking account of all relevant
considerations, and the other is that the tribunal’s decision has been
influenced by some irrelevant consideration. Suppose, for example, the
claimant has requested a postponement because his Law Centre adviser is
unable to attend on the day fixed for the hearing, and the tribunal explains
its refusal to postpone on the basis that it is not usual to list cases to suit the
availability of professional legal representatives. The claimant may found
an appeal on the fact that the tribunal has failed to take into account the
relevant consideration that he’s not paying for his representation and
therefore can’t necessarily substitute a different professional representative.
12.38
For an example of a procedural decision based on an irrelevant
consideration, suppose the tribunal decides to conduct a hearing in private
because one of the respondent’s witnesses is a senior public servant who
will be cross-examined about allegations of serious misconduct on his part.
The status of the respondent’s witnesses and the gravity of any allegations
against him are both irrelevant to the question whether the hearing should
take place in public, so the claimant will be able to attack this decision on
the basis that an irrelevant matter has been taken into consideration by the
tribunal.

Points not argued below
12.39

The EAT won’t, as a rule, entertain arguments that were not put to the
employment tribunal. In situations where the new point would require
additional findings of fact which the tribunal could have made if the point
had been raised at first instance, the justice of this is apparent. If, for
example, a complaint of constructive unfair dismissal succeeds, but on
appeal the employer seeks to raise for the first time an allegation that the
claimant had affirmed his contract by waiting several weeks after the breach
before resigning, the EAT will rightly refuse to hear the appeal. If the
employer had said earlier that the claimant had affirmed, the tribunal could
have made findings on whether the delay amounted to affirmation in the
circumstances: it’s not fair to the claimant to have to go through the stress
and expense of another hearing because the respondent forgot to argue part
of its case the first time around. An appeal isn’t intended to give either party
the chance to reformulate their case in the light of experience and then have
a second, and better-informed, bite at the cherry.
12.40
But if the tribunal simply makes a spontaneous error of law in the course
of its decision, it’s much harder to see why the decision should be immune
from appeal just because the losing party didn’t realise it needed to warn it
specifically against that error.
12.41
The EAT’s practice in this kind of situation is inconsistent. If the error is
clear enough and doesn’t arise from the appellant’s failure to formulate his
case properly, the question ‘was this argued below?’ may well be
overlooked. The result is that it is difficult even for experienced lawyers to
predict in advance which appeals will fall foul of this rule and which won’t.
12.42
This problem underlines the usefulness of giving the employment
tribunal written submissions, so there can be no subsequent doubt about
what points were taken then. But it does also mean that you need to be
careful to make sure your written submissions cover all the points you want
the tribunal to rely on.

Starting an appeal
12.43

The document that starts an appeal to the EAT is the notice of appeal. It
must be received by the EAT within 42 days from the date when the written
reasons for the decision appealed were sent to the parties, or in the case of
an appeal against an order of the tribunal, within 42 days from the date of
the order. The date on which written reasons are sent to the parties is
recorded at the end of the reasons. The rule means that the last day for
presenting an appeal is the same day of the week 6 weeks later: so if the
reasons are sent out on Monday 30 September 2013, any appeal must be
received by the EAT before 4 pm on Monday 11 November 2013.
12.44
This time limit is strictly enforced: an appeal that arrives at the EAT even
a matter of seconds or minutes after 4 pm on the last day is liable to be
rejected, and the rule is interpreted to mean that, if the documents are faxed,
transmission must be completed (not merely begun) by 4 pm.
12.45
It’s also essential that all of the required documents are included with the
notice of appeal, and reach the EAT before 4 pm on the last day. Appeals
that are missing a required document – or even a single page of a required
document – are rejected. If any documents are unavoidably missing, explain
why.
12.46
Given the EAT’s strict approach to time limits, it is rarely sensible to file
an appeal close to the deadline. Aim, at the very least, to submit it a week in
advance. The sooner you put the appeal in, the greater your margin of
safety. The EAT staff are generally very helpful in contacting a party whose
appeal has not been properly lodged. This can give you a chance to recover
the mistake – but only if you are still outside the time limit.
12.47
This covering letter enclosing a notice of appeal is intended to double as
a checklist for the documents that need to be included.

EAT fees
12.48
Appealing to the EAT now involves two fees. Lodging an appeal costs
£400. There is then a hearing fee of £1,200.
12.49
Unlike the tribunal, there is no mechanism for paying the fee when you
lodge the appeal. The EAT will issue a notice to pay after they receive your
appeal, but before they take any further action. You will then receive a
similar notice to pay shortly before the full hearing.

Drafting the notice of appeal
12.50

The standard form for an appeal to the EAT is to be found at the schedule to
the EAT Rules or on the EAT website. Unlike form ET1, it is a simple form
that can easily be typed out. It looks like this:
1. The appellant is (name and address of appellant).
2. Any communication relating to this appeal may be sent to the
appellant at (appellant’s address for service, including telephone
number if any).
3. The appellant appeals from (here give particulars of the decision of
the employment tribunal from which the appeal is brought including
the date).
4. The parties to the proceedings before the employment tribunal, other
than the appellant, were (names and addresses of other parties to the
proceedings resulting in judgment, decision or order appealed from).
5. Copies of:
(a) the written record of the employment tribunal’s judgment,
decision or order and the written reasons of the employment
tribunal;
(b) the claim (ET1);
(c) the response (ET3);
and/or (where relevant):
(d) an explanation as to why any of these documents are not
included;
are attached to this notice.
6. If the appellant has made an application to the employment tribunal
for a review of its judgment or decision, copies of:
(a) the review application;
(b) the judgment;
(c) the written reasons of the employment tribunal in respect of that
review application; and/or
(d) a statement by or on behalf of the appellant, if such be the case,
that a judgment is awaited;
are attached to this notice. If any of these documents exist but
cannot be included, then a written explanation must be given.
7. The grounds upon which this appeal is brought are that the
employment tribunal erred in law in that (here set out in paragraphs

the various grounds of appeal).
12.51
The references in the form to ‘review’ relate to the old tribunal rules. Under
the new rules reviews have been replaced by reconsiderations. Presumably
when the EAT’s form is next revised it will reflect this change. It does not
matter whether you refer to a review or a reconsideration – provided you
tell the EAT if you have made such an application and provide the
documents they request.
12.52
Paragraph 7 is the difficult part. The grounds of appeal should be
carefully drafted: they will often be the first thing that the EAT judge will
read, and the basis on which he decides whether or not the case can go
ahead to a hearing. Sometimes it will be sufficient simply to put the error or
errors of law complained of in a few concise sentences; in more complex
cases it may be necessary to outline the factual background and summarise
the tribunal’s decision in order to put the errors alleged in context. Even so,
it should be possible to summarise the grounds of appeal so that each error
of law alleged is described in a single sentence.
12.53
The most important single piece of advice that can be offered on drafting
a notice of appeal is to keep it as focused as possible. Tribunals are far from
perfect and they often make mistakes, but they rarely make a very large
number of different mistakes in a single decision. Even if they have, it’s
normally better to identify the most serious mistakes and focus on them.
Any temptation to ‘pad’ the notice of appeal by expressing what is
essentially one ground of appeal in several different ways should be
resisted. There is nothing wrong with a notice of appeal that complains of
one error only. A rambling 10-page notice of appeal that complains of bias,
failure properly to explain reasons, and 14 separate counts of perversity will
make an EAT judge feel tired from the outset, and less inclined to let the
appeal go through to a hearing.
12.54
The notice of appeal should normally be a self-contained document that
is sufficient, read on its own, to tell the EAT what the case was about, what
the employment tribunal decided, and why you say they got it wrong. The

EAT judges may sometimes skim or even skip your account of the facts
because they have started by reading the employment tribunal’s decision
which also sets out the facts. All the same, it’s probably best to include it.
Employment tribunal decisions vary greatly in quality, and sometimes the
account of the facts will be unclear, inadequate or misleading.
12.55
If you do set out the factual background in the notice of appeal (or for
that matter in your skeleton argument), make it clear which assertions are
uncontroversial and which are matters of dispute between you and the other
side. Bear in mind that, once the tribunal has made a decision, many matters
that were disputed may now have to be treated as accepted. Sometimes it is
necessary, for the purposes of appeal, to explain what was in dispute below.
But much can simply be dealt with by saying ‘The tribunal concluded that
...’
12.56
If the notice of appeal is at all long, it’s helpful to divide it into sections
under different headings. However short it is, it should be divided into
numbered paragraphs. Here as in any other kind of writing ‘a paragraph per
idea’ is a good rule to follow. Long paragraphs that deal with several
different subjects are very difficult to read.

PRECEDENT 12.56: Grounds of appeal
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
INTRODUCTION
1 The claimant was employed by the respondent as a porter. He was
summarily dismissed on 27 April 2014.
2 On 4 May 2014, the claimant started to look for advice on a potential
unfair dismissal claim against the hospital. He was not able to attend an
appointment with an adviser until 26 June 2014. On that date, an adviser at

the Care Workers’ Advice Project (CWAP) told him that he would have to
appeal the decision to dismiss him and wait 28 days before he could present
a claim, and that he had until 27 October 2014 to present his claim. She
made an appointment for him to see a solicitor at the North London Law
Centre on 3 August 2014.
3 On 3 August 2014, the claimant’s solicitor realised that he had been
wrongly advised, and his claim was already out of time. She presented an
ET1 on his behalf on the same day.
THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
4 The employment tribunal considered the question of jurisdiction at a prehearing review on 9 December 2014, and its decision was sent to the parties
on 18 December. The tribunal accepted the claimant’s evidence that in light
of the advice he had received from the CWAP adviser, he could not validly
present his claim until 28 days after he had appealed the decision to dismiss
him, and that the deadline for presenting his claim was 27 October 2014.
But the tribunal held that it had been reasonably practicable for the claimant
to have presented his ET1 within the three-month time limit, and
accordingly dismissed his claim.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
5 It was common ground that the originating application had been presented
outside the three-month time limit imposed by ERA 1996 s111(2)(a). The
tribunal correctly focused on the question whether it was satisfied that it
was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the
end of that period of three months.
6 The tribunal concluded, page 44 (paras 19–21):
We accept Mr Rahman’s evidence that he believed that he had until 27
October to put in his claim. This was based on the advice he had
received. In these circumstances, however, we are satisfied that it was
reasonably practicable for him to present his complaint within the
necessary time limits. Although Mr Rahman was not at fault, his advisers
were. They should have advised him of the correct deadline, but failed to
do so. His remedy, if any, is against them.

7. The tribunal erred in law in that it wrongly proceeded on the basis that
the claimant should be treated as if he was responsible for the error on the
part of the adviser from CWAP.
8. Mr Rahman was, at all relevant times, acting as a litigant in person.
CWAP were advising him, not representing him or conducting the litigation
on his behalf. Case-law has established that a party is fixed with the
knowledge that his representative had, or should have had, and can not
therefore rely on his own ignorance of the deadline as a justification for
extending time. But no such rule applies where a litigant is advised, but not
represented.
ORDER SOUGHT
9. The claimant seeks an order allowing the appeal and remitting the case to
the tribunal for hearing on its merits.

The choice of order disposing of the appeal
12.57
The grounds of appeal should also specify what the claimant is asking the
EAT to do. This is something that requires careful thought at the outset.
12.58
An appeal will rarely be a simple matter of win or lose: there will be
various different ways in which the EAT could deal with the case.
Sometimes the decision below will simply be reversed. Sometimes the EAT
will hold that, contrary to the tribunal’s decision, the complaint was
justified – there has been discrimination, or an unauthorised deduction from
pay, or unfair dismissal or whatever was the subject of the complaint – but
will send the case back (‘remit’ it) to the tribunal for an assessment of the
remedy. Sometimes the EAT will hold that the tribunal has approached one
of its factual findings in the wrong way, or failed to make findings of fact
that it needed to make. In that case it will almost always be necessary to

remit the case to the same tribunal or a different one to make more findings
of fact.
12.59
Losing an appeal outright is simpler: the EAT dismisses the appeal and
the employment tribunal’s decision or order stands.
12.60
The range of options, and the kinds of factors that influence the EAT in
deciding how to dispose of the appeal and whether to remit to the same or a
different tribunal, are probably best understood in the context of some
concrete examples.
Example 1
The claimant complains that she has been dismissed for using inappropriate
language in the workplace. She says that male colleagues have spoken in
the same way without being disciplined and she has suffered sex
discrimination. Her employer’s defence is that conventional standards of
conduct are different for men and women, so what it has done is impose the
same rule on both men and women, namely that they observe conventional
standards of conduct. The tribunal accepts this argument and dismisses the
claim. The claimant appeals.
The EAT has no difficulty with this. It holds that imposing different
standards on men and women is sex discrimination and allows the appeal.
However, the EAT does not hear witnesses, and the employment tribunal
has made no findings about the losses that the claimant has suffered,
because it dismissed her claim. The EAT is not in a position to decide how
much compensation to award, so it remits the case to a different tribunal to
hear evidence on this and decide on the appropriate remedy.
Comment
The EAT could, here, have remitted the question of remedy to the same
tribunal. The attack, superficially anyway, was only on the tribunal’s
understanding of how to apply the law rather than on the fairness of the
hearing. But the appellant may well fear that if the tribunal did not decide
in her favour in the first place, its assessment of compensation may be
adversely affected by its belief that she has not suffered a real injustice, and

she will probably strongly prefer to have the remedy hearing conducted by a
fresh tribunal. The EAT is unlikely to be willing to accommodate this fear
expressly, but it may reach the same result by deciding that the original
tribunal’s handling of the case was ‘wholly flawed’ or ‘completely
mishandled’. As the factual considerations affecting the question of remedy
have probably not previously been explored previously, there is no
duplication of effort in sending that question to a new tribunal.
Example 2
The claimant complains that he has been dismissed for refusing to work on
Sundays. His employer says that the reason for the dismissal was his
inflexibility. The tribunal accepts this, and the claimant appeals. The EAT
examines the tribunal’s decision and holds that it is impossible to tell from
the tribunal’s decision whether the tribunal considered that the claimant was
inflexible in any way other than in refusing, as was his right, to work on
Sundays. The EAT holds that if this was the only respect in which the
claimant was inflexible, then his complaint must succeed, and remits the
case to a different tribunal for consideration of whether, in light of this
guidance, his dismissal was unfair.
Comment
The earlier decision contains within it the suggestion that the tribunal felt
that the employee had been unreasonable, and that the tribunal must have
fundamentally misunderstood how the protection against compulsory
Sunday working operates. Sending it back to the same tribunal is likely to
leave the claimant with a doubt that he has had a fair hearing if the tribunal
reaches the same result again. The claimant will have had to persuade the
EAT that this outweighs the saving of costs and time that would be achieved
by sending the case back to the same tribunal.
Example 3
The claimant complains of sexual harassment. The tribunal doesn’t believe
her complaint, and finds that none of the incidents she complains of actually
took place. The respondent applies for costs on the ground that bringing a

claim to the tribunal that was based on lies was unreasonable. The tribunal
agrees, and says in its decision: ‘In the circumstances we consider we have
no option but to award costs to the respondent.’
The claimant appeals, saying that even if the tribunal was persuaded that
her conduct in bringing the case was unreasonable, it still had a discretion
to exercise whether or not to award costs. The EAT agrees, and remits the
case to the same tribunal so that it can exercise its discretion whether or not
to award costs.
Comment
The claimant has won a pretty hollow victory. The question whether to
award costs depends heavily on what happened in the course of the
hearing, so it’s difficult to ask a different tribunal to exercise the discretion:
it wouldn’t have any better access to the factual background than the EAT.
The likely outcome is that the tribunal will make the same decision again,
but this time it will tick all the right boxes on the way.
Example 4
The claimant is dismissed for fighting at work. She says it was a very lively
workplace and the fight was a playfight that got a bit out of hand, and she
complains of unfair dismissal. The tribunal says that the claimant’s conduct
was reprehensible, but that taking all the other factors into account it
considers that a final warning would have been more appropriate.
The employer appeals, saying that the employment tribunal erred in
substituting its own judgment for the employer’s as to what penalty should
have been imposed. The EAT allows the appeal, and remits the case to a
different tribunal for a complete rehearing.
Comment
Here the first tribunal took a wholly wrong approach to the question of
fairness: the employer’s complaint that it substituted its judgment for the
employer’s is clearly well-founded. For similar reasons to examples 1 and 2
it is preferable to send the case back to a different tribunal.

Example 5
The claimant is dismissed within a few weeks of starting work for a new
employer when she insists on being paid the £25,000 per annum at which
the job was advertised. She brings complaints under the Equality Act 2010
for sex discrimination and equal pay, the latter because the employer
employs a man in an identical role and does pay him £25,000 per annum.
The tribunal finds the employer’s evidence unsatisfactory and holds that the
claimant was entitled to be paid the same as her male colleague. It
dismisses her sex discrimination complaint on the grounds that this simply
duplicates her equal pay claim.
The claimant appeals, and the EAT finds that the tribunal has failed to deal
with the question whether or not the claimant’s dismissal was an act of sex
discrimination. It remits the case to the original tribunal for findings on this.
Comment
Here it is clear that the original tribunal took a dislike to the claimant’s
employer and disbelieved his evidence, and the error was more a matter of
oversight or misunderstanding of the claimant’s case than a positive finding
against her. The attack on the decision is not an attack on the fairness of the
process and the claimant is probably very happy for the remaining question
to go back to the same tribunal.
Example 6
When the claimant walks into the hearing room, the employment judge rolls
his eyes heavenwards and says ‘You again! You’d better watch your step.’
The claimant’s previous complaint had been heard by the same employment
judge, who had disbelieved his evidence and awarded substantial costs
against him. The claimant is again unsuccessful, and appeals to the EAT on
grounds of bias.
The EAT finds that there was an appearance of bias and remits the case to a
different tribunal for rehearing.
Comment

It will always be impossible to remit a case to the same tribunal after a
successful bias appeal.
Example 7
The claimant has complained of sex discrimination. Four weeks before the
hearing, she seeks permission to amend her complaint to clarify that she is
relying on both direct and indirect discrimination. The tribunal refuses
permission on the grounds that a new claim is now out of time and there are
no grounds on which it can properly extend time. The claimant appeals this
decision to the EAT, which manages to hear the appeal within 10 days. The
EAT considers the claim, as originally presented, and takes the view that the
allegations she has made there are sufficient to support an indirect
discrimination claim. It holds that for this reason the question about time
limits did not arise, so the tribunal approached the exercise of its discretion
on a mistaken basis. The EAT considers that it has sufficient knowledge of
all the relevant factors to allow it to exercise the discretion itself. It does so,
and permits the amendment.
Comment
Often where the complaint on appeal is that the tribunal exercised a
discretion wrongly, the appellant may prefer that the EAT should exercise
the discretion itself rather than remit the case either to the same or a
different tribunal. The EAT is likely to be willing to do this – particularly if
there is a reason for urgency – if it feels that it has access to all the relevant
facts. Quite often both parties will prefer that the EAT should exercise the
discretion itself, especially if neither has any way of predicting how the EAT
is likely to exercise it.
12.61
It can be seen from these examples that there is a great variety of ways of
disposing of a successful appeal, and you should think carefully about what
order you would wish the EAT to make if you win your appeal. If it’s your
employer’s appeal, you will obviously prefer that it is dismissed outright –
but you should still think about whether there’s scope for limiting the

damage, if the employer wins, by influencing the terms of the order the
EAT makes.
12.62
Often an important consideration is whether the case goes back to the
same or to a different, tribunal. If remission is a possible outcome (and it
usually is), it is important to be familiar with the guidance on the subject
given by the EAT at paragraph 46 of its judgment in Sinclair Roche
Temperley v Heard:1
46.1. Proportionality must always be a relevant consideration. Here the
award was for £900,000, and although we are conscious that ordering a
fresh hearing in front of a different Tribunal would add considerably to
the cost to parties on both sides who have already invested in solicitors
and Counsel, both at the Tribunal and on appeal (in the case of the
Applicants, two Counsel for the appeal), sufficient money is at stake that
the question of costs would from the one point of view not offend on the
grounds of proportionality and from the other not be a decisive, or even
an important, factor. Similarly the distress and inconvenience of the
parties in reliving a hearing must be weighed up, but (a) are rendered
necessary in any event by the decision to set aside the original decision
and (b) will not be greatly less by virtue of the extra time taken by a fully,
rather than partially, remitted hearing, the main distress and
inconvenience being caused by the matter being reopened at all.
46.2. Passage of time. The appellate tribunal must be careful not to send
a matter back to the same tribunal if there is a real risk that it will have
forgotten about the case. Of course, tribunals deal with so many different
cases per month that it is impossible for them to carry the facts in their
minds, nor would they be expected to do so. But they can normally
refresh those minds from the notes of evidence and submissions if the
case occurred relatively recently. This case was a relatively long one, and
will not on that basis alone have completely evanesced from the minds of
the tribunal. It was only just over a year ago. That in itself is quite a long
time, though the lengthy reserved decision sent to the parties on 30 July
2003 would have kept the case in the minds of the Tribunal at least until
then: but in addition they have held a remedies hearing which began in
October 2003, the hearing lasting until 18 December, and then required

consideration in chambers’ meetings in January and March, and did not
result in a promulgated decision until as recently as 19 March 2004. We
are satisfied therefore that the question of delay and loss of recollection is
not a material factor in this case one way or the other.
46.3. Bias or Partiality. It would not be appropriate to send the matter
back to the same Tribunal where there was a question of bias or the risk
of pre-judgment or partiality. This would obviously be so where the basis
of the appeal had depended upon bias or misconduct, but is not limited to
such a case.
46.4. Totally flawed Decision. It would not ordinarily be appropriate to
send the matter back to a tribunal where, in the conclusion of the
appellate tribunal, the first hearing was wholly flawed or there has been a
complete mishandling of it. This of course may come about without any
personal blame on the part of the tribunal. There could be complexities
which had not been appreciated, authorities which had been overlooked
or the adoption erroneously of an incorrect approach. The appellate
tribunal must have confidence that, with guidance, the tribunal can get it
right second time.
46.5. Second Bite. There must be a very careful consideration of what
Lord Phillips in English (at paragraph 24) called “A second bite at the
cherry”. If the tribunal has already made up its mind, on the face of it, in
relation to all the matters before it, it may well be a difficult if not
impossible task to change it: and in any event there must be the very real
risk of an appearance of pre-judgment or bias if that is what a tribunal is
asked to do. There must be a very real and very human desire to attempt
to reach the same result, if only on the basis of the natural wish to say “I
told you so”. Once again the appellate tribunal would only send the
matter back if it had confidence that, with guidance, the tribunal, because
there were matters which it had not, or had not yet, considered at the time
it apparently reached a conclusion, would be prepared to look fully at
such further matters, and thus be willing or enabled to come to a different
conclusion, if so advised.
46.6. Tribunal Professionalism. In the balance with all the above factors,
the appellate tribunal will, in our view, ordinarily consider that, in the

absence of clear indications to the contrary, it should be assumed that the
tribunal below is capable of a professional approach to dealing with the
matter on remission. By professionalism, we mean not only the general
competence and integrity of the members as they go about their business,
but also their experience and ability in doing that business in accordance
with the statutory framework and the guidance of the higher courts.
Employment law changes; indeed it has been a rapidly developing area of
the law. Employment tribunals are therefore all too familiar with the need
to apply a different legal approach to a case today from that which they
applied last year, or even last week, where the law has changed, although
the cases may be on all fours as regards their facts. Some areas of
employment law have not been easy, and the approach to be adopted in
considering whether there has been race or sex discrimination in a case
such as this is just such a matter which has understandably caused
problems for tribunals. It follows that where a tribunal is corrected on an
honest misunderstanding or misapplication of the legally required
approach (not amounting to a “totally flawed” decision described at
46.4), then, unless it appears that the tribunal has so thoroughly
committed itself that a rethink appears impracticable, there can be the
presumption that it will go about the tasks set them on remission in a
professional way, paying careful attention to the guidance given to it by
the appellate tribunal.
12.63
If there has been a successful challenge to the fundamental fairness of the
employment tribunal’s process and the case is to be re-heard in its entirety,
remission will almost always be to a different tribunal. If there has been
some fairly technical failure by the tribunal in exercising a discretion that is
liable to be influenced by the factual context, with which the original
tribunal is already familiar, then the EAT may be more inclined to remit the
case to the same tribunal. If there is a decision that fails by an oversight to
deal with one of the claimant’s heads of claim, again the EAT will probably
remit that matter to the same tribunal.
12.64
Your tactical decision whether you want the case remitted to the same or
a different tribunal will probably depend in part at least on whether you feel

that the original tribunal was fundamentally well-disposed to your case or
not. The EAT’s decision whether to remit the case to the same or a different
tribunal may depend in part – although this will not be acknowledged – on
whether it feels that the tribunal got the wrong answer, or got the right
answer by the wrong route.
12.65
Often, but not always, the party appealing the decision will prefer that
remission should be to a different tribunal, and the party resisting the appeal
will prefer remission to the same tribunal. Example 5 is an exception to this.

Remission to the same tribunal for expanded
reasons
12.66
One of the basic requirements of an employment tribunal’s decision is that
it must contain sufficient factual findings and reasoning to allow the parties
to understand why they have won or lost. Failure to provide adequate
reasons is therefore an error of law.
12.67
In these kinds of cases, the EAT will often adjourn the appeal and direct
the tribunal to rewrite part of its decision before the appeal is heard: see
Burns v Consignia plc (No 2).2 This has been approved by the Court of
Appeal in Barke v Seetec;3 see also Woodhouse School v Webster.4 The
theory is that if the tribunal has made a good decision but, by oversight, not
made its reasoning clear, it should have a chance to do so.
12.68
The practical result of this is that appeals based on inadequate reasoning
by the tribunal will often be futile, unless the reasoning is so poor that a
referral for clarification is obviously inadequate.

Rejection of an appeal on the papers
12.69
Sometimes a judge at the EAT will read the notice of appeal and
accompanying documents and form the view that the appeal discloses no
reasonable grounds for bringing the appeal. In these cases, rule 3(7) of the

EAT Rules of Procedure permits the EAT to reject the appeal without a
hearing. It is important to be aware that this decision is not final: there is a
right (in effect) to request an oral hearing before a judge.
12.70
Don’t be deterred by rejection at this stage unless you recognise that the
appeal was really just an attack on legitimate findings of fact or an exercise
of discretion. If you believe that what you are complaining of is an error of
law, you should persist. The EAT is rather too much inclined to reject
appeals at this stage, and the decisions are not always fully considered. A
case that looks hopeless on a quick read of the papers may look very
different after argument.
12.71
A significant factor for unrepresented claimants is that if they request an
oral hearing, they may be able to benefit from free representation at that
hearing under the Employment Lawyers’ Appeals Advice Scheme
(ELAAS). This can be extremely valuable: the ELAAS advisers are
experienced employment lawyers who may be able to focus the appeal on
its one or two best points and significantly improve its chances of success.
12.72
An oral hearing on a decision to reject an appeal on the papers is
requested by writing to the registrar to ‘express dissatisfaction’ with the
reasons given by the judge or registrar for rejecting the appeal. This letter
can be very brief. If you would like ELAAS representation at the oral
hearing, it can’t do any harm to request it in the same letter.

Notes of oral evidence given at the original
hearing
12.73
Sometimes you will need to draw the EAT’s attention to oral evidence that
was given to the employment tribunal. Employment tribunal hearings are
not taped or recorded by a shorthand writer, but the employment judge has a
duty to take notes of the evidence. These notes – mostly written longhand –
are of variable quality and completeness. Some judges take nearly verbatim
notes of the hearing (some slow proceedings right down to dictation speed
for the purpose), some write down only what they consider important; some
are accurate, and others less so. Both sides will probably have taken their
own notes, which can also be used if appropriate.
12.74
Parties will also often have notes of the hearing, especially if they are
represented. The quality of these notes will vary in the same way as judges’
notes.

When are notes of evidence needed?
12.75
Notes of evidence will normally be needed if the appeal is on grounds of
perversity: if it is said that the tribunal made findings of fact for which there
was no evidence at all, or made findings against the overwhelming weight
of the evidence, the EAT will not be able to decide whether this is so unless

it knows what evidence was given. If it is said that the tribunal has failed to
resolve one of the key factual issues between the parties, notes of evidence
may not be necessary if the relevant difference between what the claimant
says and what the respondent says is clear from the witness statements.
There may, however, have been an important factual issue that only
emerged clearly in cross-examination. If that is so, then notes of those parts
of the cross-examination will be needed.
12.76
Again, this will make more sense in the context of concrete examples.
The examples used are those that appear at para 12.60.
In example 1, there is no relevant dispute of fact between the parties: the
employer says that the rule it applied was not discriminatory, the claimant
says it was, but both sides agree what happened. This appeal can clearly be
resolved without notes of evidence.
In example 2, the respondent would probably have wanted the EAT to see
notes of any evidence given about how the claimant was said to have been
inflexible, in the hope of persuading the EAT that the tribunal had a
legitimate basis for finding that the claimant had been inflexible in some
way other than merely refusing to work on Sundays.
In examples 3 and 4, both appeals concern the complaint that the tribunal
applied the wrong legal test. The test applied by the tribunal appears from
its decision, so notes of evidence will not help the EAT decide this.
In example 5, whether or not notes of evidence are needed depends on how
the respondent approaches the appeal. If the respondent says that the reason
the tribunal did not deal with the sex discrimination issue is that the
claimant did not give any evidence about it, the EAT may require notes of
evidence in order to establish whether or not that is the case. If the
respondent simply argues that as a matter of law the claimant cannot run an
equal pay case and a sex discrimination case on the same facts, then notes
of evidence will not be needed.
In example 6, notes of evidence will not be needed, since the complaint is
about a remark made by the employment judge. But if there is a dispute

about whether the remark was really made, then if either the claimant or her
adviser made a note of the remark at the time, it will be necessary to
produce that.

Agreeing notes of evidence, or getting hold of the
employment judge’s notes
12.77
The EAT Practice Direction says:
7.1 An appellant who considers that a point of law raised in the Notice of
Appeal cannot be argued without reference to evidence given (or not
given) at the Employment Tribunal, the nature or substance of which
does not, or does not sufficiently, appear from the written reasons, must
ordinarily submit an application with the Notice of Appeal. The
application is for the nature of such evidence (or lack of it) to be
admitted, or if necessary for the relevant parts of the employment judge’s
notes of evidence to be produced. If such application is not so made, then
it should be made:
7.1.1 if a PH is ordered, in the skeleton argument or written submissions
presented prior to such PH; or
7.1.2 if the case is listed for FH without a PH, then within 14 days of the
seal date of the order so providing.
Any such application by a respondent to an appeal, must, if not made
earlier, accompany the respondent’s Answer.
12.78
This is not particularly user-friendly. What it seems to mean is that if you
think that the notes of evidence will be needed, you should ask the EAT to
give directions about them. The subsequent subparagraphs of paragraph 7
set out the procedure that the EAT will follow. The gist is that the EAT will
ask the parties to try to agree a note of what evidence was given in the
relevant respects. If they cannot agree then, provided the EAT considers that
notes of evidence are necessary, it will send a request for the employment
judge’s notes to the tribunal. There is a warning about possible costs

penalties if parties unreasonably request notes of evidence or unreasonably
fail to co-operate in agreeing what evidence was given.
12.79
The procedure is cumbersome. It is not obvious why the EAT needs to
get involved at all in negotiations between the parties with a view to
agreeing notes of evidence until and unless they have broken down.
However, the practice direction had better be followed, so it is suggested
that a party who thinks that notes of evidence will be needed should lodge
an application for directions as to notes of evidence with the appeal.
P12.79

PRECEDENT 12.79: Application for directions as to
notes of evidence
APPLICATION FOR DIRECTIONS
AS TO NOTES OF EVIDENCE
1. The claimant believes that it will be necessary for the just resolution of
the appeal for the Appeal Tribunal to have sight of notes of evidence.
2. This evidence is relevant to [explain what aspect of the appeal it is
relevant to].
3. The witnesses whose evidence is relevant are [insert name(s) of
witness(es)].
4. The relevant evidence is [insert a brief description of the evidence that is
relevant to the ground of appeal in question].
5. The claimant’s own notes of the relevant evidence are incomplete, but
they are attached. [Or, if you think your own notes are good enough, you
might say something like, ‘The claimant’s own notes, which are not
verbatim, but which she believes to contain the gist of the evidence given on
this subject, are attached.’]

6. The claimant accordingly asks the Appeal Tribunal to direct that the
parties should seek to agree notes of the relevant parts of the evidence, and,
in default of such agreement, that the employment judge’s notes should be
requested.

Affidavits
12.80
Where there is a challenge to the way the hearing was conducted, and
particularly if there is a complaint of bias, it will often be necessary for the
claimant and/or his adviser to make a sworn statement about what took
place at the hearing. This form of sworn statement is called an affidavit. An
affidavit can be drafted by anyone, but it has to be sworn in the presence of
a solicitor. Any high street firm of solicitors or law centre is likely to be
able to provide a solicitor to administer an oath at short notice, usually for a
fee of around £10. Once the statement is drafted, it should be taken by the
person making it to a solicitor and sworn.

I, José Corujo, of 14b North Street, High Street, Winchcombe, Cheltenham,

1 My complaint of unfair dismissal was heard at the Bristol employment
tribunal on 3 and 4 April 2013. The employment judge was Mr Marks.
2 When I walked in to the hearing room, Mr Marks raised his eyes
heavenwards and said, ‘You again! You had better watch your step this
time.’
3 Mr Marks was the employment judge who heard a previous complaint I
had made against Mercia Trains in July 2007. He had not believed my
evidence, and he had awarded £4,000 costs against me because he said that
I had made up all my evidence.
4 I was very shaken when Mr Marks said this. I thought I had no chance of
a fair hearing before him. I told him that I did not think it was fair that he
was hearing this case because he was biased against me. He said ‘You had a
very fair hearing from me last time. Let’s get on with the case.’
5 The hearing went very badly for me. When I was speaking Mr Marks
glared at me, sighed heavily and interrupted me constantly. When I was
giving my evidence he asked a lot of very hostile questions. He did not ask
the respondent’s witnesses any questions at all, and he listened and took
notes without interrupting when their counsel was speaking.

If the claimant is successful – wholly or in part – before the employment
tribunal, the employer may appeal.
12.82
In a case that is listed for a preliminary hearing, the respondent to the
appeal is sent the notice of appeal before the preliminary hearing and

invited to make ‘concise written submissions’ on the notice of appeal with a
view to showing that the appeal has no reasonable prospect of success.
These submissions can follow a very similar format to a skeleton argument,
but it is important that they should be concise. The point is to demonstrate
that there is really nothing to argue about; long and detailed argument is
likely to demonstrate the exact opposite.
12.83
If the employer appeals it is vital that you respond. Failure to do so will
almost certainly result in you being debarred from participating in the
appeal (normally after a warning from the EAT).

The respondent’s answer
12.84
The form for this, like the form for a notice of appeal, is straightforward,
and can be downloaded from the EAT website.
12.85
Drafting the respondent’s answer is often easy, requiring nothing more
than a statement that you intend to resist the appeal on the grounds given in
the tribunal’s decision. This is normally the appropriate response. You
probably want to uphold the tribunal’s conclusion and support its reasoning
(or the other side would not be appealing). This simple approach also meets
your requirement to put in a response and prevents you being debarred.
12.86
There is need for some thought at this stage, however. Two decisions
need to be made. The first is whether, if the employment tribunal’s
reasoning is defective, there is any alternative basis on which the result can
be supported. The second is whether to put forward a cross-appeal.
12.87
To decide whether to put forward an alternative argument in support of
the tribunal’s decision, the question to ask is this: supposing the attack made
by the appellant on the decision is well-founded, can I say that given the
tribunal’s findings of fact (or the facts that are agreed to be common
ground), this result was inevitable anyway? If the answer is yes, then an
alternative basis can be put forward for the tribunal’s decision.
12.88

There’s also a tactical aspect to this decision. Putting forward an
alternative basis for the tribunal’s decision does make it look as if you fear
that that the decision as it stands is weak and needs bolstering. For this
reason, additional grounds for the tribunal’s decision should be used where
the tribunal has missed the point, or set out a weak basis for its decision
when there was a much stronger basis available to it. Additional grounds
weaker than those relied on by the tribunal should never be thrown in as a
make-weight if the tribunal’s own reasons set out the best argument for the
result reached by the tribunal.

PRECEDENT 12.88: Respondent’s notice
The facts of this appeal are taken from example 4 at para 12.60 above: Ms
Loop was dismissed for fighting at work. The tribunal’s decision that
‘taking all the other factors into account a final warning would have been
more appropriate’ flies in the face of established authority and is
indefensible. However, elsewhere in its decision the tribunal has accepted
Ms Loop’s evidence that play fights at this workplace were common,
sometimes involving senior management and always condoned by them. In
the circumstances, she says, in this workplace it was impossible to
characterise such behaviour as gross misconduct and therefore unfair to
dismiss her summarily for a first offence.

4. The grounds on which the respondent will rely are the grounds relied
upon by the Employment Tribunal for making the decision or order
appealed from and the following grounds:
(i) The employment tribunal found (at paragraphs 13 and 14) that the
respondent’s conduct was indistinguishable from conduct that was
regularly engaged in by colleagues working at the appellant’s London
Road premises and condoned by senior management. It follows from this
that it was not open to the appellant to characterise what she had done as
misconduct, and still less so to characterise it as gross misconduct.
(ii) In the circumstances, the tribunal’s decision that the appellant’s
decision to dismiss the respondent was unfair was an inevitable
consequence of the findings of fact it had made (and which are not
challenged by the appellant) at paragraphs 13 and 14 and should stand.

Cross-appeals
12.89
A cross-appeal is an appeal by the respondent to the main appeal. If both
parties are aggrieved by the decision, it may simply be a matter of timing
who gets in first with their appeal and becomes the ‘appellant’, and who is
the respondent, who cross-appeals.
12.90
If the other side has appealed and you wish to cross-appeal, you have to
decide whether you want your appeal to go ahead in any event, or only if

the main appeal is successful. Sometimes the cross-appeal simply won’t
arise unless the main appeal is successful. This too will make much more
sense in the context of an example.
Example
Suppose Saifur Rahman wins his case. The tribunal finds that he’s been
unfairly dismissed and awards him compensation. However, by the time of
the hearing he has decided to study full-time for a nursing degree, and the
tribunal decides that he has not done enough to mitigate his loss and awards
him no compensation past the point at which his nursing course started.
Mr Rahman and the hospital are both aggrieved by this outcome. Mr
Rahman says that his decision to study to be a nurse was entirely reasonable
in the circumstances, and the tribunal wrongly approached the question of
mitigation as if he had to prove that he had done enough. The hospital says
that having found that Sister Winston had invented her allegation against
Mr Rahman, the tribunal wrongly inferred that he had been dismissed for
making a protected disclosure without making any findings of fact about
what motivated the disciplinary panel to dismiss him.
Alternative (a)
The hospital asks its lawyers to advise on appeal, but decides against as Mr
Rahman’s compensation is less than the amount it would cost to do so. Mr
Rahman appeals the decision on mitigation, at which point the hospital
realises that if he wins his appeal, it may face a much larger compensation
award. It therefore decides to cross-appeal the finding of liability. Here Mr
Rahman is the appellant, the hospital is the respondent, and the hospital’s
appeal is a cross-appeal. The hospital decides to make its cross-appeal
conditional: they don’t think it’s worthwhile going through a re-hearing on
liability just to escape paying Mr Rahman the modest compensation
awarded by the original tribunal, but if Mr Rahman wins his appeal and
opens up the possibility of much larger award, then it wants to have the
chance of defeating the claim outright.
Alternative (b)

Mr Rahman is disappointed with the amount of compensation he is
awarded, but decides he doesn’t have time, now he’s studying, to conduct
an appeal himself, and he can’t afford to pay for representation. He decides
not to appeal. Meanwhile the hospital has decided that this is a matter of
principle, and it lodges its notice of appeal. When Mr Rahman realises that
he’s going to have to argue a case in the EAT anyway in order to hold onto
his award of compensation, he thinks he might as well appeal the decision
on mitigation while he’s about it, so he cross-appeals on the mitigation
point. This time the hospital is the appellant and it is Mr Rahman,
respondent to the main appeal, who has cross-appealed. Mr Rahman
decides to make his cross-appeal unconditional: if the hospital loses its
appeal, he would prefer to avoid a further hearing before the employment
tribunal to reassess his compensation, but he thinks that if he wins his crossappeal the hospital will probably offer him some more money to settle the
case.

RESPONDENT’S ANSWER

1. The respondent is Saifur Rahman.
2. Any communication relating to this appeal may be sent to the respondent
at the North London Law Centre, 43 Holloway Lane, London N19 5BQ.
3. The respondent intends to resist the appeal of Saint Julian’s Hospital
NHS Trust.
4. The grounds on which the respondent will rely are the grounds relied
upon by the employment tribunal for making the decision or order appealed
from and the following grounds:
5. The respondent cross-appeals from the tribunal’s decision of 11 February
2015 that he should not be compensated for any financial loss after the
commencement of his full-time nursing course in October 2014.
6. The respondent’s grounds of appeal are:
(i) That the tribunal erred in imposing on the respondent the burden of
showing that he has sufficiently mitigated his loss. The correct test is to
inquire whether the employer has demonstrated on the balance of
probabilities that the employee has failed to mitigate his loss: see Wilding
v British Telecom [2002] IRLR 524.
(ii) In light of the tribunal’s finding at paragraph 27 that the respondent
has been unfortunate in failing to find alternative work despite vigorous
efforts to mitigate his loss up to September 2014, its finding that he was
unreasonable in deciding to enter full-time education as a student nurse
from October 2014 was perverse in the sense that it was a finding that no
reasonable tribunal properly directing itself on the facts already found
could have reached.
Order sought
(iii) The respondent respectfully invites the Appeal Tribunal to allow the
cross-appeal and remit the case for a re-hearing limited to the question of
what further compensation he should be awarded for the period from 1
October 2014.

The practice direction
13.1
Detailed guidance for parties to appeals in the EAT is set out in the EAT
Practice Direction, which can be downloaded from the EAT website at
www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/employment-appeals. Much of what follows
summarises and expands that guidance. The practice direction itself is
essential reading for anyone dealing with an appeal.

The appeal bundle
13.2
Creating the appeal bundles is the appellant’s job. The task is likely to be
less onerous than putting together the bundle for the original hearing as the
EAT’s task is narrow compared to the employment tribunal’s. The
documents required for an appeal are listed in the EAT Practice Direction at
para 6, and are as follows:
1)
2)
3)
4)

Judgment or order appealed from and written reasons.
Sealed notice of appeal.
Respondent’s answer or submissions for a preliminary hearing.
Formal claim (plus any additional information or written answers,
that is, any information provided in response to the respondent’s
requests, but not including documentary evidence).
5) Response (plus any additional information or written answers).
6) Questionnaire and replies (if the case is a discrimination case).
7) Relevant decisions and orders of the employment tribunal (that is,
any decisions or orders other than the one appealed that are

necessary to allow the EAT to understand the background to the
appeal).
8) Relevant orders of the EAT (and here it is probably wise to assume
that all the EAT’s orders in the case are relevant).
9) Affidavits and employment tribunal comments (if any).
10) Other relevant documents (including extracts from the bundle
before the employment tribunal, and any necessary notes of the oral
evidence that the tribunal heard, either as agreed by the parties or as
recorded by the chairman).
13.3
The bundle should be compiled in this order. Like a bundle for the
employment tribunal, it should be page-numbered throughout, and it should
have an ‘index’ page at the front listing what is in it and where it is to be
found.
13.4
Bundles must not exceed 100 pages without permission from the EAT.
Normally, this should not be a problem. Most appeals do not involve
voluminous papers.

The skeleton argument
13.5
Unlike the employment tribunal, the EAT requires written submissions in
all cases. In the EAT these are called ‘skeleton arguments’. A skeleton
argument should expand on the argument set out in the notice of appeal,
providing more detail and fuller discussion.
13.6
EAT judges periodically complain that skeletons are too inclined to turn
into fleshy corpses. It is understandable that a busy judge wanting to get to
the heart of a lot of appeals in a short time should prefer a concise
document, and it is inadvisable to submit a rambling or repetitive skeleton
argument. At the same time, you have a different agenda from the judge’s.
You want to win the case more than you want to help the judge deal with it
quickly. Nonetheless, a concise and punchy skeleton argument will do you
more good than a long rambling one.

13.7
Unlike the employment tribunals, the EAT judges do read the documents
before the hearing starts. Often they will have a formidable command of the
detail by the time of the hearing. Some judges will listen patiently to
advocates, and will genuinely not make up their minds until they have heard
oral argument from both sides. Others will be difficult to shift once they
have read the papers and formed a preliminary view. Some simply take in
information and argument better through their eyes than their ears.
13.8
The skeleton argument should make all the main points that the party
wishes to make, and should refer to any case-law that the claimant wishes
to refer to in argument. It should be a self-contained document that, read
alone, is capable of persuading a judge that she knows what the case is
about and what the right answer is. It is helpful to set out in the body of the
skeleton argument any legislation relied on, and to indicate (and often
quote) the relevant paragraphs of any case-law. The standard advice on
skeleton arguments is that you should aim to write the judgment for the
judge. This can be taken too literally, but it is a useful guide to the right
style and tone, which should be calm and measured.
13.9
The skeleton argument should be sent to the EAT at least 14 days before
a full hearing, or 10 days before a preliminary hearing. These deadlines
should be met if at all possible. But if a late skeleton argument is presented
with an apology and a reasonable excuse the consequence will rarely be
worse than a growl from the judge. The most important thing is to give the
judge and members of the EAT a chance to read the skeleton argument in
advance. If all else fails a skeleton argument lodged three or four working
days before the hearing will normally be enough to head off a postponement
and costs. The appellant’s skeleton should be accompanied by a chronology.
13.10
Skeleton arguments will vary widely with the needs of the particular
case, so the following document outline is just a suggestion for one way
that the skeleton could be laid out.

BETWEEN
SAIFUR RAHMAN
Appellant
and
SAINT JULIAN’S HOSPITAL NHS TRUST
Respondent
SKELETON ARGUMENT FOR THE APPELLANT
INTRODUCTION
1. The claimant was employed by the respondent as a porter. He was
summarily dismissed on 27 April 2014. On 4 May 2014 the claimant started
to look for advice on a potential unfair dismissal claim against the hospital.
Between 4 and 12 June he telephoned eight different advice agencies, most

of which could not offer him an appointment at all. Finally the Care
Workers’ Advice Project (CWAP) offered him an appointment on 10 June
2014. He attended that appointment, but on arrival he was told that the
adviser he was due to see was off work that day. He was not able to get
another appointment until 23 June 2014. On 23 June, the adviser at the
CWAP told him that he would have to appeal the decision to dismiss him
and wait 28 days before he could present a claim. He was also told that he
had until 27 October to present his claim to the tribunal. The adviser also
told him that public interest disclosure cases were very complicated and he
ought to see a solicitor. She made an appointment for the claimant to see a
solicitor at the North London Law Centre at 4 pm on 3 August 2014.
2. At this point it was realised that the deadline for submitting the claim had
been 26 July 2013 and that accordingly the claim was out of time. The ET1
was submitted to the tribunal the same day.
3. The question whether the claim was out of time was considered by the
Employment Tribunal at a hearing on 9 December 2014 and a judgment
sent to the parties on 18 December 2014. The Tribunal held that it had been
reasonably practicable for the claim to be presented within the three-month
time limit. Mr Rahman’s case was therefore dismissed. Mr Rahman now
appeals that decision.
THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
4. It was common ground that the originating application had been
presented outside the three-month time limit imposed by ERA 1996 section
111(2)(a). The tribunal therefore focused on whether the case came within
section 111(2)(b), which allows the tribunal to consider a complaint of
unfair dismissal provided it was presented within such further period as the
tribunal considers reasonable in a case where it is satisfied that it was not
reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the end of
that period of three months.
5. The tribunal heard evidence from Mr Rahman and his wife that he had
not known of the time limit at the time he was dismissed: ET decision page
2, paragraph 11; page 5, paragraph 19.

6. The tribunal also heard that Mr Rahman had relied on the advice given to
him by CWAP on 23 June. At this point he became aware that there was a
relevant time limit. Based on the advice he had received, however, he
believed that he was required to serve a grievance prior to bringing a claim
and that the relevant deadline was 27 October.
7. Having made these findings of fact the tribunal concluded, page 5
(paragraph 19–21):
We accept Mr Rahman’s evidence that he believed that he had until 27
October to put in his claim. This was based on the advice he had
received. In these circumstances, however, we are satisfied that it was
reasonably practicable for him to present his complaint within the
necessary time limits. Although Mr Rahman was not at fault, his advisers
were. They should have advised him of the correct deadline, but failed to
do so. His remedy, if any, is against them.
THE PRESENT APPEAL
8. In his appeal to this tribunal Mr Rahman takes a single point:
the tribunal failed properly to consider the effect of the advice given to
him by CWAP.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
9. The general principles were set out by Brandon LJ in Wall’s Meat Co Ltd
v Khan [1979] ICR 52 at 61B–C:
With regard to ignorance operating as a similar impediment, I should
have thought that, if in any particular case an employee was reasonably
ignorant of either (a) his right to make a complaint of unfair dismissal at
all, or (b) how to make it, or (c) that it was necessary for him to make it
within a period of three months from the date of dismissal, an industrial
tribunal could and should be satisfied that it was not reasonably
practicable for his complaint to be presented within the period concerned.
For this purpose I do not see any difference, provided always that the
ignorance in each case is reasonable, between ignorance of (a) the
existence of the right, or (b) the proper way to exercise it, or (c) the
proper time within which to exercise it. In particular, so far as (c), the

proper time within which to exercise the right, is concerned, I do not see
how it can justly be said to be reasonably practicable for a person to
comply with a time limit of which he is reasonably ignorant.
10. The respondent accepts that ignorance of the time limit, if reasonable,
will mean that it is not reasonably practicable for a claimant to present a
claim in time: reply, paragraph 2.1, at page 27. The appeal therefore is
focused on whether the tribunal properly considered the question whether
Mr Rahman ignorance of the time limit was reasonable.
EFFECT OF LEGAL ADVICE
11. Mr Rahman received advice from CWAP. It is common ground that this
advice was wrong and that Mr Rahman relied upon it. The question for this
tribunal therefore is the proper approach to a situation where a claimant has
received erroneous legal advice.
12. It is important to distinguish between two types of case:
• the claimant has sought legal advice from a solicitor or other qualified
adviser, and the advice is erroneous or incomplete;
• the claimant has retained a solicitor or other adviser to act for him
generally in relation to his claim, and his adviser makes an error in
relation to the time limit.
13. As a convenient shorthand, this skeleton refers to these types of case as
‘adviser cases’ and ‘retainer cases’ respectively. The present case is an
adviser case not a retainer case.
14. In an adviser case there is no general principle that the claimant is
bound by any error that the adviser may make and cannot thereafter contend
that it was not reasonably practicable for him to present his complaint in
time: Sen paragraphs 13–17.
15. The respondent contends that once a claimant has received legal advice
he must be credited with both the information he received and the
information it was reasonable for the adviser to give him. The cases upon
which they rely are, however, retainer cases, not adviser cases. They are
therefore distinguishable from the present case (see para 23 below).

16. In Dedman v British Building Ltd [1974] ICR 53 Mr Dedman had
engaged solicitors to act for him. Lord Denning addressed the consequences
of this by reference to the earlier case of Hammond v Haigh Castle & Co
Ltd [1973] ICR 148.
17. Hammond concerned an employee who delegated conduct of his case to
the trade association of which he was a member. The association mistook
the time limit and failed to present the claim in time. Sir John Donaldson
(as he then was) concluded (at page 152G) that:
The employee was not prevented by illness or any other cause from
presenting his complaint. He had a choice whether to do so himself or to
use skilled advisers and agents. He chose the latter course and placed the
matter in the hands of an association, of which he was a member. It, like
the employee, could have presented the complaint within the four-week
period. The reason why it was not so presented was quite simply that the
association did not realise that the time limit expired on August 27.
18. Dedman adopted the approach taken in Hammond: see Lord Denning in
Dedman at page 61E–G:
But what is the position if he goes to skilled advisers and they make a
mistake? The English court has taken the view that the man must abide
by their mistake. There was a case where a man was dismissed and went
to his trade association for advice. They acted on his behalf. They
calculated the four weeks wrongly and posted the complaint two or three
days late. It was held that it was ‘practicable’ for it to have been posted in
time. He was not entitled to the benefit of the escape clause: see
Hammond v Haigh Castle & Co Ltd [1973] ICR 148. I think that was
right. If a man engages skilled advisers to act for him – and they mistake
the time limit and present it too late – he is out. His remedy is against
them.
19. The importance of an adviser being ‘engaged’ was confirmed in
Harvey’s Household Linens v Benson [1974] ICR 307. See at page 309F–G,
per Sir John Donaldson:
The operative word is ‘engages’. Certainly the Department of
Employment’s officers hold themselves out as advisers and it is very

much in the public interest that they should do so. But by no stretch of
the imagination can they be said to be ‘engaged’ by or to be ‘the advisers
of’ any particular member of the public, in the sense in which a lawyer is
‘the adviser of’ his client. The test is probably one of agency: are they
agents of the complainant? Plainly they were not in this case ...
20. Likewise Riley v Tesco Stores [1980] IRLR 103 was a retainer case. The
tribunal decision, quoted by Stephenson LJ at page 104, includes the
following passage in relation to the relationship between the applicant and
her CAB representatives:
Whether or not she had a remedy for being given the wrong advice is
irrelevant if they were special advisers engaged by the applicant. The
applicant having engaged the bureau to make the application and taken
their advice must accept the situation that if they are at fault she too is at
fault.
21. A similar relationship existed in Trevelyans (Birmingham) Ltd v Norton
[1991] ICR 488 between Mr Norton and the solicitors who acted for him in
the criminal courts. The Court of Appeal concluded that the solicitors
should have been aware of the need to bring proceedings in time and this
knowledge was imputed to Mr Norton.
22. All of these decisions are distinguishable from the present case because
here, although CWAP was consulted for advice, it was not engaged to
represent Mr Rahman or to present his case on his behalf. CWAP did not act
as his agent in relation to the claim. Without an agency relationship there is
no justification for transferring to a claimant the knowledge that another
individual had, or ought to have had, simply because the claimant speaks to
them about their case or asks for their advice.
23. This is the situation addressed in London International College v Sen
[1993] IRLR 333. Mr Sen had received advice from a solicitor, but did not
engage him to conduct the case, and was also advised by the tribunal staff.
On both occasions the advice given was inaccurate. Nevertheless the
tribunal considered that it was not reasonably practicable for Mr Sen to
claim in time, and this decision was upheld on appeal both by the EAT and
by the Court of Appeal.

24. Sen, like the present case, is an adviser case not a retainer case. The
approach adopted by Sen is a simple one. The tribunal should examine what
advice a claimant received and should consider the effect it had on his
understanding of his position. If, as a result of this advice, a claimant is no
longer ignorant, or no longer reasonably ignorant, he cannot rely on the
escape clause. If, however, he remains ignorant, and this ignorance is
reasonable, it is not reasonably practicable to present the claim in time. The
question whether the claimant is reasonably ignorant is essentially one of
fact: see Sen at paragraph 17.
25. A different approach was set out by Stephenson LJ in Riley. Although
the tribunal had found that the Citizens Advice Bureau in that case had been
engaged, Stephenson LJ suggested that it would not have altered his view if
it had not been: see page 106, at paragraph 17. It is submitted that these
comments were obiter and are inconsistent with the approach taken in Sen,
which should be followed in preference.
26. The claimant’s approach is also supported by the judgment of May LJ in
Palmer v Southend Council [1984] ICR 372 at 385:
Dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case, an industrial
tribunal may wish to consider the manner in which and reason for which
the employee was dismissed, including the extent to which, if at all the
employer’s conciliatory appeals machinery has been used. It will no
doubt investigate what was the substantial cause of the employee’s
failure to comply with the statutory time limit; whether he had been
physically prevented from complying with the limitation period, for
instance by illness or a postal strike, or something similar. It may be
relevant for the industrial tribunal to investigate whether at the time when
he was dismissed, and if not then when whether at the time when he was
dismissed, and if not then when thereafter, he knew that he had the right
to complain that he had been unfairly dismissed; in some cases the
tribunal may have to consider whether there has been any
misrepresentation about any relevant matter by the employer to the
employee. It will frequently be necessary for it to know whether the
employee was being advised at any material time and, if so, by whom; of
the extent of the advisers’ knowledge of the facts of the employee’s case;

and the nature of any advice which they may have given to him. In any
event it will probably be relevant in most cases for the industrial tribunal
to ask itself whether there has been any substantial fault on the part of the
employee or his adviser which has led to the failure to comply with the
statutory time limit. Any list of possible relevant considerations,
however, cannot be exhaustive and, as we have stressed, at the end of the
day the matter is one of fact for the industrial tribunal taking all the
circumstances of the given case into account.
27. May LJ’s focus on the need to inquire into the details of the advice both
sought and given, and the circumstances under which it was provided –
including the information available to the adviser – indicates that he must
have anticipated cases in which the mere fact of having received some
advice did not prevent a claimant relying on his ignorance as grounds for it
not being reasonably practicable to present a claim.
THE TRIBUNAL’S ERROR
28. The tribunal proceeded on the basis that Mr Rahman was fixed with the
error of his advisers. In other words, they treated his case as a retainer case.
In doing so they erred. He had not retained CWAP to act for him; he had
merely sought advice. Had the tribunal properly treated this as a retainer
case, they would have concluded that Mr Rahman’s ignorance of the proper
time limit was reasonable. This would have led to a finding that it had not
been reasonably practicable for him to bring the claim within the time limit.
CONCLUSION
29. For the reasons set out above the tribunal is invited to allow the appeal,
substitute a decision to extend time and to remit this case to employment
tribunal to decide the merits of the claim.
30. Once the time point has been dealt with there is no advantage to remittal
to the same tribunal. None of the evidence they heard or matters they dealt
with will be relevant to the rest of the claim. Therefore, in order that the
matter can be listed with the minimum of difficulty, we ask that remittal be
to the tribunal generally, rather than the tribunal who heard the pre-hearing
review.

Bundles of authorities
13.11
‘Authorities’ here means the material used by the parties to persuade the
EAT that their statement of the law is correct. The appeal bundle will be
composed of material that is specific to the particular case: the decision in
that case, the claim form and response, extracts from the hearing bundle
before the employment tribunal, etc. The authorities bundle will normally
contain reports of other decided cases of the EAT or higher courts and may
also include extracts from the relevant legislation, extracts from textbooks
or legal journal articles, etc.
13.12
Paragraph 14 of the EAT practice direction gives instructions for the
citation of authorities. The EAT should be sent three copies of a complete
bundle of all authorities relied on. The bundle of authorities should be
agreed with the other party so that all the authorities that either side is
relying on are contained in a single bundle. Strictly speaking this is the
appellant’s job, but if you are unrepresented or represented by a small
organisation that does not have easy access to all the necessary materials, it
is worth trying to charm the respondent’s representative into taking on the
task. Ideally, the specific passages relied upon in the authorities should be
sidelined (that is, a vertical line should be added in the margin beside the
passages relied on) so that the EAT can quickly and easily find the relevant
parts.
13.13
Cases should be listed first in date order, then any legislation, and finally
any other materials. Extensive reference to authority is not encouraged. It
will be fairly rare that a case can be argued in the EAT with no reference at
all to authority, but if there is only one relevant previous case then the
authorities bundle should contain only that case.
13.14
The EAT has a list of ‘familiar authorities’. The list is available on the
EAT website. Bundled copies of these authorities are available to everyone

at any EAT hearing. The familiar authorities are ones that are regularly cited
to the EAT, such as the key cases dealing with amendments to the notice of
appeal or the tribunal’s duty to give reasons. Since they are already
available at the hearing, these cases should not be included in the authorities
bundle.
13.15
Lawyers specialising in employment law form a fairly small sub-group of
the legal profession, and most EAT judges will have appeared in their time
as advocates before the EAT. Because of this, there is a real chance that the
presiding judge at the EAT will have taken part either as judge or as
advocate in one or more of the cases on which the parties rely as authorities.
It is a good idea to check whether this is so once the hearing list has
appeared on the EAT website (this will normally be by the Friday afternoon
of the week before the hearing), in order to pick up any available clues as to
the judge’s likely direction of approach. If the judge today was on the losing
side in the case that you rely on, it will be prudent to tread carefully.
Assertions that the result in that case was ‘obvious’ or ‘inevitable’, for
instance, are unlikely to go down well. Even more tact will be called for if
today’s judge presided in the case you say was wrongly decided or seek to
distinguish. If the other party is in that position, being aware of it in
advance may provide opportunities to increase their discomfort.

PRECEDENT 13.15: Index to bundle of authorities
This example is of a substantial authorities bundle that was required for a
complex argument, but it should not be regarded as typical. More often only
two or three cases will be needed, and no other authorities. The EAT will
have a copy of Butterworths Employment Law Handbook, so there is no
need to include legislation unless it is not contained in that book.

Preliminary hearings
13.16
If the EAT cannot decide on the papers whether there is enough in the
appeal to justify a full hearing, it will list the case for a preliminary hearing.
Preliminary hearings take place before a full EAT, and skeleton arguments
are required as for full hearings. Employment Lawyers Appeals Advice
Scheme (ELAAS) representation may be available for an unrepresented
appellant. Preliminary hearings can take anything from a few minutes to an
hour or so. The purpose, from the appellant’s point of view, is to persuade
the EAT that there is a reasonably arguable case.
13.17
As so often, the theory is one thing and the practice is another. Some
EAT judges have a tendency to hear the whole appeal at the preliminary
hearing, and may dismiss it not because it is not reasonably arguable but
because, having heard it fully argued, they do not think it is well-founded.
For this reason an appellant whose case is listed for a preliminary hearing
should be as well prepared for the preliminary hearing as he or she would

be for the full hearing, and ready, in effect, to argue the case in full at this
stage if necessary.
13.18
When it comes to authorities for a preliminary hearing, appellants are in
something of a bind. If the preliminary hearing is conducted only as an
inquiry into whether the case is reasonably arguable, authorities will rarely
be necessary, and some judges will be irritated by a full skeleton argument
making extensive reference to authority at this stage. On the other hand, if
you are appearing before a different variety of judge you may find yourself
faced with a series of pointed questions about the effect on the appeal of
previous decided cases. The best advice is probably not to cite authorities
extensively in the skeleton argument for a preliminary hearing, but to go to
the hearing armed with copies of all the relevant authorities (and having
read them carefully) in case it turns out that the judge wishes to discuss
them.
13.19
Skeleton arguments for preliminary hearings should be lodged at the EAT
not less than 10 days before the hearing. The appellant’s skeleton argument
should be accompanied by a chronology listing the main relevant events in
date order.

Rule 3(10) hearings
13.20
A rule 3(10) hearing is the hearing before a judge sitting above that takes
place if an appellant objects to the rejection of the appeal on the papers: see
para 12.69. Similar comments apply to rule 3(10) hearings as to preliminary
hearings: it is prudent to attend ready to argue the case in full.

The hearing
13.21
At the EAT, like the employment tribunal, the form of address for the
members of the tribunal is ‘Madam’ or ‘Sir’ as appropriate.
13.22

Unlike in employment tribunal hearings, parties or advocates stand to
address the court. It is conventional to pause at the door and bow in the
general direction of the presiding judge if leaving or entering the room
while the court is sitting. Everyone in the hearing room stands when the
judge and members enter or leave the room: this will be difficult to forget
because an usher will say loudly ‘Court rise!’ at the appropriate moment.
13.23
Often there will be several cases listed in each court for a 10.30 am start.
They will not all start at 10.30 am, but the EAT may not always take them
in the order in which they appear on the list, so attend promptly at the time
given. An usher (curiously, ushers at the EAT wear a black gown, although
no one else does) will tell the parties when they need to go into court for
their case, but this does not mean that the other parties and/or their
representatives are not allowed in until called. It is a good idea for parties
who are not called on first to sit at the back of the court for the hearing or
hearings before theirs (or at least for part of them) to get an idea how this
judge runs things. Hearings are normally public, and it is perfectly
acceptable to enter or leave quietly while the hearing is going on. An usher
will call the parties to the hearing room in time for their hearing.
13.24
In the EAT, there will almost never be witnesses, so the hearing follows a
simpler pattern than hearings in the employment tribunals. Normally the
appellant will be expected to make his or her submissions first, followed by
the respondent. The appellant will then have the opportunity to reply briefly
to any points made by the respondent that she has not already dealt with.
The EAT will then either adjourn to consider its decision, to be given the
same day; or it may reserve its judgment, which means that it will not
finalise the decision that day but will take some time over it (typically a few
weeks) and hand it down on a date to be announced.
13.25
Occasionally the EAT will decide not to call on one side or the other to
make any submissions at all. If this happens to you, don’t take it as a slight
or resist: it is unequivocal good news. If the respondent to the appeal is not
called upon, it means that the EAT has listened to the appellant’s arguments
and is not persuaded by them; the respondent need not add anything to
persuade the court to dismiss the appeal. If, contrary to the usual rule, the

respondent is asked to speak first, it almost certainly means that the EAT
thinks that the appeal is strong and wishes to hear first from the party it
considers has the harder task. If it happens this way around, then the
decision not to call upon the appellant is bound to be provisional: if the
respondent makes more headway than the EAT had expected, and having
heard the respondent’s arguments the court is inclined after all to dismiss
the appeal, the appellant will certainly be called upon before a final decision
is made.

Advocacy before the EAT
13.26
Presenting a case before the EAT feels very different from advocacy at the
employment tribunal. In some ways it is easier. The issues are clearly
defined in advance, each side has read the other’s skeleton argument, the
bundle is probably much shorter, and witnesses – the wild-card in any
hearing – are mercifully absent. Law students will be comfortingly
reminded of mooting. On the other hand, the legal argument itself is likely
to be more focused and more difficult.
13.27
A representative who has submitted a fully reasoned skeleton argument
may be at a loss to know what exactly to say on the day of the hearing. The
judge and wing members will not want to hear the skeleton read aloud: they
will have read it themselves before the hearing begins. Much will depend
on the style of the presiding judge. Some will say ‘Yes, Miss Campbell?’
and then wait in silence until you have finished speaking, giving no clue
what is going on in their minds. Others will go straight to what they think is
your weakest point and ask difficult and pointed questions about it. Some
will even start by announcing their own ‘provisional’ view, which – though
it can be discouraging – at least gives you a clear idea of what you are up
against. The representative needs to be ready for any of these approaches,
or anything in between. It is helpful to have a prepared speech that picks up
and develops the points made in the skeleton argument – adding
illustrations or analogies, for example, or going into a more detailed
analysis of the cases cited, or drawing attention to the underlying merits –

but it is also essential to be ready to abandon the script and simply deal with
what the judge or wing member indicates is troubling her.
13.28
The judge’s task is to understand the submissions made by the parties or
their advocates, and then to decide whether to accept or reject them. Your
task is to make your submissions as lucidly and persuasively as possible.
Often the result is a lively debate with the presiding judge. This should
almost always be seen as an opportunity. It is useful because it helps the
judge to understand exactly what points you are making.
13.29
A prolonged debate is often also a good sign – at least to some extent. If
an appeal is self-evidently hopeless or an advocate clearly out of their
depth, most judges will not prolong the agony unnecessarily. If they are
pressing you with difficult questions, this is probably because they want to
know your answers. This suggests that they have not made a final decision
and that they are interested in listening to you.1
13.30
Sometimes, however, discussion can degenerate into an attempt by the
judge to persuade you to see – and admit – the flaw in your case. Judges,
after all, have almost always been advocates themselves for many years,
and many still like to win arguments.
13.31
This can place you in a difficult position. Admitting a weakness or
difficulty in your case is often good advocacy. Most cases in the EAT are
not entirely one-sided and there is normally something to be said against
your argument. Pretending that there isn’t is more likely to make you look
foolish than anything else. If there is an authority that points against you, or
your approach might cause unfairness in other situations, it is better to
acknowledge that. But have your argument why you should succeed
anyway ready.
13.32
Occasionally, it is even prudent to give ground and admit that part of the
argument originally put forward is not well-founded. If you realise during
the hearing that your position is truly untenable, accept that and try to move
on. But as a rule you should resist making important concessions even

under significant pressure from the judge. Any concession made before the
EAT will be very difficult to withdraw for the purposes of a further appeal.
13.33
This is easy advice to give, less so to follow. Judges are, as a rule, clever
and determined individuals who are used to calling the shots, and they are
authority figures in an environment where the people around them are more
than averagely respectful of authority. Judges – like everyone else – should
be treated with respect in the sense of courtesy, and the additional formality
that is conventional in court is not in itself objectionable. At the same time,
they should not be allowed to muscle in on your own decisions about how
to run your case. If an extended wrangle is developing after it is clear that
the judge has understood the submission and is not persuaded by it, a
formula along these lines can be useful: ‘You have had my submissions on
that question and I have nothing to add to them. The next point I wish to
make is ...’.
13.34
The point to remember is that the judge’s task is to decide the case, not to
persuade one side or the other to concede it.

Judgments
13.35
In most cases the EAT will retire for a time after submissions have been
completed to consider their decision, and will then announce it orally, with
reasons, on the same day. The judgment is tape-recorded, but a transcript
will not be made unless requested by one of the parties or ordered by the
EAT. It is usually prudent to request a transcript as it is difficult to take a
full note if the judge gives oral judgment at normal speaking speed, and it is
at the least unsatisfactory for parties to realise after it is too late that they
did not properly understand the reasons for the decision. A transcript will be
needed if there is to be any further appeal. A transcript can be requested
once the judge has finished giving judgment, or in writing within 14 days of
the hearing.
13.36
If the EAT thinks that the case is difficult, or it does not have time to
finalise its decision on the same day, it will reserve its judgment. In that

case the parties will be given a few days’ notice of the date when the
judgment will be handed down. Sometimes they will get a draft judgment –
which is strictly confidential – to check for minor factual or drafting errors
a day or so before it is handed down.
13.37
Whether or not a written judgment is provided, the EAT will always issue
an order: this is a short document, normally only one page long, that says
very briefly how the appeal is disposed of without giving reasons.

Costs
13.38
If judgment is given on the day, either party may wish to make an
application for costs. The relevant rules are at 34A–D of the EAT Rules and
at paragraph 19 of the EAT practice direction. If an appli-cation for costs at
the hearing is contemplated, it is usually a good idea to notify the other
party of the fact before the hearing. The EAT’s power to award costs is
similar to that of the employment tribunal, and costs are still rare. The
application should only be made if there are strong grounds for it. A party
applying for costs should go to the hearing with several copies of a schedule
showing what costs have been incurred and how.
13.39
Parties who have paid for legal representation can claim the costs they
have incurred. Parties acting for themselves can claim payment for the time
they have reasonably spent preparing the case in one of two ways. The
detailed provisions are at EAT rule 34D, but broadly parties can claim either
a fixed rate of £37 per hour, or for the amount that they can prove they have
lost ‘for the time reasonably spent on doing the work’.2 In other words,
parties can claim for the loss of money they would have earned in the time
they have reasonably spent preparing the case, or if they cannot prove any
such loss, then they can claim £37 per hour. It would seem to be open to a
party representing him or herself who earns less than £37 per hour to
choose not to prove his actual loss, but to claim the £37 hourly rate instead.

an intention to apply for costs
Mr G Marrow
Carrot & Marrow Solicitors
21 Lower St

Dear Mr Marrow
Fiona Cameron v The Old Fashioned Tailor Ltd EAT/1234/13/PC
Your client’s evidence was clear, as recorded in the employment tribunal’s
decision in this case, that the company believed that it was entitled to
impose different standards of workplace behaviour on men and women, and
that it did so. Specifically, the tribunal found (at paragraph 14) that Ms
Cameron was dismissed for using language that the company would have
and did tolerate in male employees.
Ms Cameron’s appeal is bound to succeed, as your client has admitted
discriminating against her on grounds of her sex. Please consider urgently
with your client whether they should agree that the appeal should be
allowed and the case be remitted to a different tribunal to consider remedy.
If the appeal is not conceded, I have instructions to make an application for
costs at the hearing.
Yours sincerely
Natalie Cummings

Withdrawing or settling an appeal
13.40
Appeal cases are settled more rarely than first instance cases, but it can still
be fruitful to negotiate at this stage. It is slightly more complicated
withdrawing or settling a case that has been appealed to the EAT than a case
that is pending before an employment tribunal. The permission of the EAT

is required to withdraw an appeal, and it is not sufficient simply to write to
the EAT indicating the wish to withdraw. If you wish to withdraw, then a
letter must be written to the EAT signed by both parties asking for
permission to withdraw the appeal and enclosing a draft order also signed
by both parties. It is difficult to imagine circumstances in which this
application would be refused.

Getting an appeal allowed by consent

13.41
This is less straightforward, because even if the parties are unanimous that
the employment tribunal’s decision is wrong, that is no guarantee that the
EAT will agree. The parties themselves cannot set aside the employment
tribunal’s order or remit the case to the tribunal for a rehearing: only the
EAT can do that.
13.42
However, if the parties are agreed as to the order the tribunal should
make, they should write a letter to the EAT attaching a draft order and either
explaining in the body of the letter or in a skeleton argument signed by both
sides why the appeal should be allowed on the terms suggested. The EAT
may list the case for a hearing at which one or both parties can seek to
persuade them to dispose of the case as requested, but if the employment
tribunal’s error of law is clear, a persuasive skeleton argument submitted
with the letter and draft order may be sufficient to head off a hearing.

Further appeals
13.43
Appeal from the EAT is to the Court of Appeal (or in Scotland to the Court
of Session). Permission must be sought from the EAT when the decision is
handed down, or from the Court of Appeal within 21 days of the sealed
order.
13.44
Making an application to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal is
a cumbersome and time-consuming process and the time in which it must
be done is short. This means that you should give some thought, before the
hearing at the EAT, to the question whether or not you will want to appeal
further if unsuccessful. Funding is likely to be difficult, but don’t delay an
application for permission until the funding problem has been solved: this is
unlikely to be an acceptable excuse for a late application.

Funding an appeal to the Court of Appeal

13.45
Appeals to the Court of Appeal raise difficult – and often insuperable –
practical problems if money is short. If there has been public funding for
the first appeal, it may be worth an application for public funding for a
further appeal, but this will normally be much more difficult. Only a
solicitor or an advice agency that has a contract with the Legal Aid Agency
can help.
13.46
If public funding is not available, then if you have an offer of free
representation, or if you are considering representing yourself at the Court
of Appeal, the main obstacle will be the risk of having to pay the other
side’s costs if you lose. Costs orders in the employment tribunal and the
EAT are rare, and are generally only made against a party who has in some
way behaved badly. The situation is very different in the Court of Appeal,
where the normal rule – subject to fairly rare exceptions – is that if you
lose, you pay the other side’s costs. Costs for even a short hearing in the
Court of Appeal can run to many thousands of pounds, and the risk of
losing the case and having to pay this is usually prohibitive. If the employer
loses the case at the EAT but then decides to appeal to the Court of Appeal,
this fear can even force a claimant who has been successful so far not to
oppose the appeal.
13.47
There are various approaches to this problem that can be tried, and
sometimes one of them will work.
13.48
The simplest of the available techniques is to persuade the other side to
promise not to make an application for costs. This sounds optimistic, but if
it is the employer who wishes to appeal further because the decision at the
EAT sets what the employer regards as a dangerous precedent, it can work:
in this event, the employer wants the case properly argued on both sides so
that the precedent set by the Court of Appeal is final and authoritative.
13.49
If the other side won’t agree to this voluntarily, then if there are reasons
why it is clear that a costs order against you would be unfair whatever the
outcome, the EAT or the Court of Appeal may be persuaded to grant
permission only on condition that there will be no costs against the

employee in any event. If, for example, your employer’s appeal only arises
because they behaved badly at first instance and got their response struck
out, it might be said that – even if there is reason to ask whether the striking
out order was excessive – there would be no question of an appeal at all if
the employer had conducted its case properly.
13.50
If it is not possible to head off any threat of a costs application from the
outset, the other approach is to look for backing from a body that will
underwrite the risk of a costs order and/or fund the appeal in its entirety. If
your case is about discrimination, it may be worth approaching the Equality
and Human Rights Commission, although the Commission is unlikely to
support any case unless it is expected to have a wide public significance.
You might approach your trade union, if you belong to one – but a trade
union that has not supported a case at first instance will only rarely be
willing to back an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
13.51
If no single body is willing to underwrite the risk, if the point is
sufficiently important it may be possible to put together a group of bodies
each of which will agree to pay a proportion of the costs if the appeal is
unsuccessful: for example, trade unions, pressure groups, charities or advice
umbrella organisations. If the case is important enough, this may be worth a
try, but it will take luck, good contacts, strong powers of persuasion and a
great deal of telephone time.

APPENDIX A

Yearwood v Royal Mail
YEARWOOD
Appellant
v
ROYAL MAIL AND OTHERS
Respondents
EAT/843/97
Morison P, Messrs Jackson and Warman
11 July 1997
MR JUSTICE MORISON (PRESIDENT):
This is an interlocutory appeal, that is, it is an appeal against a refusal of an
Industrial Tribunal Chairman to adjourn a case which is due to take place
on 14 July 1997. It is a case in which there are allegations of race
discrimination involving Royal Mail and three named individuals.
The circumstances in which the application for an adjournment came to
be made are that the Applicant in this case, Mr Yearwood, presented his IT1
dated 3 February 1997, naming in paragraph 3, a Jenny Sabastion of the
Wellingborough District Racial Equality Council as a representative. That
organisation is a charity and is not in receipt of substantial funds. They
provide legal assistance in race discrimination cases in their area. They are

engaged on behalf of another applicant in a case in the Leicester Industrial
Tribunal. The case has gone part-heard and was adjourned and re-listed for
hearing on 14 July.
On 6 June, after the part-heard case had been listed for hearing, the
organisation received formal notification from the Bedford Industrial
Tribunal that Mr Yearwood’s case was listed for hearing on 14 July.
Promptly they wrote to the Bedford Industrial Tribunal requesting a
postponement. The request was refused. They also wrote to the Leicester
Industrial Tribunal on 12 June asking for the part-heard case to be re-listed.
Not surprisingly, the Leicester Tribunal told the organisation that it would
be better if they renewed their application to Bedford, because ‘priority is
given to part-heard claims’. Accordingly, further applications were made to
the Bedford Industrial Tribunal who have refused them subject to any
decision, of course, that we make in this matter.
These questions, that is, whether cases should be adjourned or not in the
interests of justice, are very difficult to determine and we have considerable
sympathy with the attitude which has been taken by the distinguished
Chairman in this case.
There are many good reasons for holding parties to a commitment which
has been made. When the date was originally fixed for this case I think it
was at a time when the organisation thought that they would be available.
Furthermore, the Respondents to the complaint have an interest in having
their case heard and determined, particularly where individuals have been
named as Respondent, as has happened in this case. Justice delayed is, as
we know, justice denied, and we can understand the learned Chairman
taking the attitude he did. But that said, this seems to us to be a listing crisis
of the sort which is capable of causing injustice.
Had the organisation to which I have referred been a professional firm of
Solicitors, there could be no doubt that it would have been the right
decision to have refused an adjournment and to require Mr Yearwood to
obtain alternative legal services, or the services of a different partner within
the same firm. But organisations such as the one in question do, in our
experience, provide useful assistance to the community which they serve,
and we are mindful of the difficulties which listing problems can genuinely
cause them. They have in our judgment, acted properly and promptly in this
matter.

There is no particular prejudice which the Respondents are able to
identify if the appeal were to be allowed, although they do point out that the
three individuals do not work in the same place and have been organised to
attend on 14 July, but that said, there is no further particular injustice which
they can legitimately point to, if we were to accede to the appeal.
Not without some difficulty, we have arrived at the conclusions that the
interests of justice require that this case should be adjourned. If it is not, Mr
Yearwood would have to appear on 14 July without representation to ask
for an adjournment; we imagine that, in those circumstances, the Tribunal
would be likely to accede to his request. If that were to happen, then the
inconvenience to the witnesses would be much greater than if we were to
accede to the appeal. If, on the other hand, he turned up unrepresented on
14 July, and an application for adjournment was refused, we can well
understand how he might feel at a disadvantage in proceeding with
complaints of unlawful discrimination, which are serious complaints to
make and to have tried. It seems to us, in general, that it is important that
this type of case in particular should be heard after the parties have had a
fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing before the Industrial Tribunal.
Therefore, with difficulty, we have on balance been prepared to accede to
this appeal. Although for technical reasons we are forced to say that the
refusal of the adjournment was, in our judgment, so unreasonable as to be
worthy of our interfering with it, we would like to make it quite clear that
we are not unappreciative of the reasons which must have lain behind the
attitude which has been taken by the Chairman in this case.
For these reasons we feel obliged to allow this appeal and to order that
the case be adjourned from 14 July.
