Best Practices for Structuring Terraform
Projects with Multiple VPCs

Introduction

Imagine orchestrating a vast symphony, akin to managing multiple Virtual Private Clouds
(VPCs) across AWS regions. This scenario requires a harmonious and structured
approach, much like conducting a musical performance with different sections. This guide
explores the recommended modular approach for managing Terraform code, reflecting the
complexity and coordination of a symphony.

Clarity and Organization

Analogy: Think of the orderliness of a library, facilitating easy location of genres or
authors, contrasted with disarray.

Solution & Reference: Implement a filing system for your Terraform code, similar to a
library's organization. This ensures project clarity and order. Marcel Zehner provides
detailed insights at https://marcelzehner.ch/2019/05/25/terraform-using-multiple-files-for-
configurations-and-variables/.

Reusability and Modularity

Analogy: Envision a kitchen's organization, where ingredients are stored in clear, reusable
containers for efficiency.

Solution & Reference: Utilize reusable Terraform modules for infrastructure patterns, akin
to a well-stocked kitchen. This promotes efficiency and consistency. More on this approach
can be found in the Modern Technologist Guide at
https://moderntechnologist.com/provisioning-vpcs-using-terraform-vpc-module-step-by-
step-guide-for-common-use-cases/.

Reduced Complexity

Analogy: Compare the coherence of a well-structured essay to the confusion of a text
wall.

Solution & Reference: Organize your Terraform into focused files, paralleling an essay's
structure. This facilitates easier updates and comprehension. Insights can be gained from

Improved Team Collaboration

Analogy: Reflect on the efficiency of a relay race, with each participant contributing to the
final outcome.

Solution & Reference: Distribute Terraform tasks among team members, mirroring a relay
race's teamwork. Effective strategies for this are outlined at FreeCodeCamp:

Better State Management

Analogy: Similar to individual accounts for distinct financial goals, separate state files offer
clearer oversight.

Solution & Reference: Apply distinct state files for different environments, akin to using
separate accounts for financial management. Charity Majors discusses this in depth at
https://charity.wtf/2016/03/30/terraform-vpc-and-why-you-want-a-tfstate-file-per-env/.

 

Conclusion

Adopting a modular approach for Terraform, especially in multi-VPC AWS region projects,
is akin to orchestrating a grand musical performance or managing a well-structured library.
By implementing best practices, your infrastructure becomes as orderly, scalable, and
maintainable as possible, ensuring smoother operations and enhanced collaboration.

These methodologies are not just about maintaining order; they empower your team to
build and manage infrastructure with the clarity, precision, and harmony of a well-
conducted symphony.
