Arnold Clark Data Breach

Cyber attacks and successful data breaches have
become more and more commonplace over the
years. Even large companies have found themselves
under attack, sometimes leading to millions of
people losing their information and resulting in large
compensation payouts.

As for Arnold Clark, their failure to protect their
customer data has resulted in over a million people
losing many details, some of which have been
rumoured to be financial and personal details.

Have you been an Arnold Clark customer in the last
three years? If so, we advise you to check if you
have been affected by the hacking incident in late
2022. You could also be owed compensation. Click

the link and we'll check if you qualify for up to
£4,000 in compensation.

Why are people making
compensation claims against
Arnold Clark?

Arnold Clark is a popular car dealership business in
the UK. On December 23rd 2022, hackers bypassed
the company’s security systems and stole the
personal information of over 1.1 million customers. At
first, Arnold Clark claims that they had been advised
that no personal information had been accessed via
the leak and continued as normal.

However, in the following weeks, cyber hackers
contacted Arnold Clark with threats to release the
information they had stolen if they did not pay a
ransom. Arnold Clark did not give in to the demands,

Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

and soon after, the following information was spread
across the dark web:

e Names

e Addresses

e Phone Numbers

e Email Addresses

e Vehicle Details

e Bank Details (Sort code and account number)

 

Questions began to arise as to why it was that the
information was able to be accessed in the first
place.

What makes me eligible for an Arnold Clark Data Breach
Compensation claim?

You may think that you need to have lost out financially because of the breach in order to make a
claim, but this isn’t the case. For many people that having their privacy violated in ways such as

424

Title of ebook of origin: 43.arnold_clark_data_breach_compensation_claims.pdf

this, this can be highly distressing and thus constitute a reason to claim for damages. Arnold Clark
had the legal duty to make sure that no unauthorised third parties had access to private customer
information held by them.

Finding out if you qualify is easy, and takes less than a minute of your time. All you need to do is
click the button and fill in a few easy details. We will introduce you to legal specialists who will get
in contact with you to explore your claim potential and discuss the best way forward.

We will help you get the best possible representation. You don’t have to worry about paying
anything up front to make a claim, as all of the lawyers we introduce you to work on a no-win, no-
fee basis.

On the 28th of January, Arnold Clark released a statement: tT

“On the evening of 23 December 2022, Arnold Clark Automobiles was a victim of a cyber attack. Our
external security network consultants alerted us to unusual activity on our network, and we
immediately took steps to minimise the impact of the attack by removing all external connections to
our network to protect our customer data, third-party partners and our systems.

“While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of our
investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to steal copies of
some data that we hold. Due to the type of cyber attack that we have been subjected to, it is
extremely difficult to accurately identify what has been stolen; however, our teams are working with
our external advisors to understand the exact nature and extent of that data.

“While this crime and theft of data has been targeted towards Arnold Clark, we recognise the impact
this could have on our partners and customers. We take their safety and the safety of their data very

425

seriously, therefore while further analysis is ongoing, we are taking the following steps now:

e We are setting up a dedicated call/help centre with our partners Experian to help those affected, or
potentially affected, with more information.

e We are writing to all affected and potentially affected customers and will continue that
communication as our investigation progresses.

e We will provide regular cyber security updates on our websites.

e We will offer our affected and potentially affected customers 24 months’ fraud/credit protection
with Experian free of charge.
During this incident, we have been in constant communication with the regulatory authorities and
have sought useful guidance from the police, and we will continue to do so to help other companies
learn from our experience and be better prepared for possible situations such as this.

As a result of this incident, we have taken the decision to rebuild our networks in a new segregated
environment, which has meant that our operational systems are not yet fully functional, so we
apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers.

If you need to contact us about this incident, you can do so by contacting Arnold Clark Customer
Services (https://www.arnoldclark.com/contact/customer-services).“

Two elements within the statement have raised alarm bells. By admitting that they did not
segregate their network, they also confirm they were lax in their efforts to maintain an acceptable
level of standard in security systems. Also, should they have not been at fault at all, they would
have no reason to lose further capital by offering such a long-lasting premium service for free.

As a result, plenty of affected customers have been looking to claim compensation against the
