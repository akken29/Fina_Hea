ABOUT ¥ GROUP ACTIONS v- HAS YOUR DATA BEEN BREACHED? v

At KP Law, we believe that a mammoth data breach event has happened, yet the full eee see eee keene

extent of how this breach affects Arnold Clark customers may take months to become
clear. Nevertheless, over the last few weeks we have started to see a significant rise in
fraud reports being made following the data theft and dark web posts.

 

To date, the process of notifying customers has taken months, and many Arnold Clark Recent Posts

customers still have not received notification of a data breach. As we publish this article,

we have seen no evidence that Arnold Clark has begun notifying those customer's whose Keller Postman UK merges with Lanier,
data has recently been published on the dark web. This lack of communication from Longstaff, Hedar & Roberts to form
Arnold Clark leaves these customers exposed to fraud. We highly recommend anyone specialist collective redress law firm KP
who has been a customer of Arnold Clark over the last 10 years - and perhaps even Law Limited

before that - to take immediate steps to protect themselves. Find out how to do this

here.

We also believe that failures to adopt standard security measures may have made this
attack easier. As such, we have launched a group action to help affected customers in
England & Wales claim compensation. We currently represent in excess of 7,500
customers and are helping them to seek information and redress.

Some organisations use self-destructing emails to automatically delete communications,
either after a certain amount of time or when they request it. We do not condone this
practice, especially in data breach cases where notification is widely used to prove an
individual's involvement in a breach and is thus vital evidence when making a claim. While
we cannot be sure if Arnold Clark has set its emails to self-destruct, we have seen this
happen in other cases. As such, we advise anyone who receives a data breach notification
to keep a copy just in case.

ABOUT ¥ GROUP ACTIONS y_ HAS YOUR DATA BEEN BREACHED? ¥
Similar privacy violations have resulted in fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. As such,
Arnold Clark customers are at high risk of being targeted by cybercriminals. Anyone who
thinks they might be involved in the Arnold Clark data breach should take immediate
steps to protect themselves.

(?) How did the Arnold Clark data hack happen?

Arnold Clark experienced a cyber security incident on 23rd December 2022. This is
reported to have been carried out by the Play ransomware cartel. On 28 January 2023,
Arnold Clark released a statement about the attack. In this, the company appears to admit
that, while its IT systems are capable of being set up so that they are not vulnerable to
external attacks, work to achieve this started after the hack. Did Arnold Clark unwittingly
admit that poor data security made this hack possible?

A failure to adopt standard security measures often makes such attacks possible. If
Arnold Clark did not have adequate protections in place, it must be held responsible for
any loss or distress experienced by its customers because of this breach.

The list of potentially compromised data includes customer:

e National Insurance numbers
e Dates of birth

e Phone numbers

e Emails

e Copies of passports

e Home addresses

e Copies of bank statements.

Why did Arnold Clark delay telling customers
about the breach?

It is not yet clear why Arnold Clark did not notify its customers “without undue delay”,
which it should have done. As far as our data protection solicitors can tell, there is no
good reason for this delay. By not letting customers know about the risk immediately,
Arnold Clark left them at a very high risk of further cyberattacks, fraud and identity
theft.

attack. Our external security network consultants alerted us to unusual activity on our
network, and we immediately took steps to minimize the impact of the attack by removing all
external connections to our network to protect our customer data, third-party partners and
our systems.

‘While we were initially advised that all our data was secure, unfortunately, in the course of
our investigation, it has become clear that during this incident, the attackers were able to
steal copies of some data that we hold. Due to the type of cyber attack that we have been
subjected to, it is extremely difficult to accurately identify what has been stolen; however, our
teams are working with our external advisors to understand the exact nature and extent of
that data.

‘While this crime and theft of data has been targeted towards Arnold Clark, we recognise the
impact this could have on our partners and customers. We take their safety and the safety of
their data very seriously, therefore while further analysis is ongoing, we are taking the
following steps now:

e We are setting up a dedicated call/help centre with our partners Experian to help those
affected, or potentially affected, with more information.

e We are writing to all affected and potentially affected customers and will continue that
communication as our investigation progresses.

e We will provide regular cyber security updates on our websites.

e We will offer our affected and potentially affected customers 24 months’ fraud/credit
protection with Experian free of charge.
